Research, with few exceptions, finds that immigration on average has positive economic effects on the native population, but is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives. Studies show that the elimination of barriers to migration would have profound effects on world GDP, with estimates of gains ranging between 67 and 147 percent. Development economists argue that reducing barriers to labor mobility between developing countries and developed countries would be one of the most efficient tools of poverty reduction.\" ,\"http://toledocitypaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/immigrants-toledo-refugees-protest.jpg\"],\n",

    "397 West Virginia Senate hopefuls take center stage ahead of Fox News debate\"], \"articles_text\": [\"MORGANTOWN, W.Va. –  Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. is the leader of the Senate. But one Republican primary candidate is talking about the longtime Kentucky lawmaker like he’s the leader of a drug cartel. “One of my goals as U.S. Senator will be to ditch cocaine Mitch,” candidate Don Blankenship declared at the end of a new campaign ad. The origins of “cocaine Mitch,” according to the campaign, are rooted in accusations of drug smuggling on Chinese ships associated with the family of McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. The narcotic-themed nickname enters the dialogue on the eve of a nationally televised debate at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday on Fox News Channel. Blankenship will be joined on stage in Morgantown by Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va. and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Considered a toss-up in the midterm elections, the West Virginia Senate race is one where Republicans hope to have the chance to unseat incumbent Joe Manchin, a Democrat who first won the seat in a 2010 special election. According to a Fox News poll, three Republicans are considered to be “top tier” candidates ahead of the May 8 primary: Blankenship, Evan Jenkins and Patrick Morrisey. Jenkins, a U.S. congressman, topped the list of Republican contenders. But the race is getting national attention because a group with ties to GOP leadership, the Mountain Families PAC, has spent at least $1.3 million to try to derail Blankenship’s candidacy. Operatives fear the year in prison the former coal baron recently served on a conspiracy to violate mine safety standards, tied to the 2010 Upper Big Branch mine disaster that killed 29, may jeopardize an opportunity to unseat Manchin. Blankenship shrugs off the impact of the intra-party effort to keep him off the November ballot. “I think it probably moves me up a little bit,” Blankenship said of the ads blanketing TV and radio broadcasts, calling him “convicted criminal Don Blankenship.”  “I don’t think Mitch McConnell realizes,” he said, “how anti-him and how anti-the establishment West Virginians are.” While Blankenship's bid is a long shot, he's testing whether a party led by an anti-establishment outsider can rein in its anti-establishment impulses. \"The establishment, no matter who you define it as, has not been creating jobs in West Virginia,\" Blankenship said at a primary debate this past week. Jenkins, who leads the field of Republicans, has been a congressman for three years and served as a state senator in West Virginia for 12 years. Morrisey is the first Republican to serve as attorney general in the state since 1933, according to his campaign website. Manchin is not running unopposed; he races a primary challenger in Paula Jean Swearengin, an environmental activist whose platform is more in line with Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont. President Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 40 points in the Mountain State in the 2016 presidential election. The state has long been considered a prime pickup opportunity for Republicans, who hold a two-seat Senate majority that suddenly feels less secure given signs of Democratic momentum in Nevada, Arizona, Tennessee and elsewhere. If Democrats can win West Virginia, which gave Trump his largest margin of victory in the nation, they may have a slim chance at seizing the Senate majority. 7\n",

       "'Republican Virginia state Delegate Nick Freitas gained national attention earlier this month after a video of a speech he made on the floor of the House of Delegates defending Second Amendment supporters against vicious attacks went viral.  In the speech, he fought back against the politically correct overreach that’s become all too common – specifically, Democrats in the Virginia Legislature who demonized law-abiding citizens who support “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms” guaranteed by the  Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  A video of Freitas’ floor speech has received 15 million views on his Facebook page, where he said: “For several days now, some Democrats in the Virginia House of Delegates have made public speeches comparing those of us who take our oath to the Constitution seriously, to include the Second Amendment, to Nazis and segregationists.”  The speech given by Freitas, a former Army Green Beret who served two tours in Iraq, put him on the map virtually overnight in the Virginia U.S. Senate race, where he hopes to win the Republicans nomination to run against Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November.  Freitas’ action is a prime example of the inevitable, growing backlash against the political correctness that increasingly permeates every facet of our lives.  After the tragic shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14 that claimed 17 lives, businesses were attacked and pressured to take a side against the National Rifle Association and its 5 million law-abiding members.  FedEx was the exception – pledging to keep discounts it offers to NRA members – but other companies caved to extreme, politically correct demands to take an anti-NRA stance.  Delta Airlines, headquartered in Atlanta, capitulated to the PC pressure, announcing it would no longer offer discounts to NRA members. The backlash was fierce as the Georgia Legislature removed a $40 million tax break for Delta as part of a tax cut package that eventually passed.  So to deny just 13 discounts, Delta flushed a $40 million tax break. Maybe Delta’s shareholders are as PC as its leadership; if not, expect the next shareholder meeting to be very interesting.  Are we really now living in a world where all private businesses are going to be forced to take sides on political hot-button issues?  The obsession with political correctness has invaded the entertainment world as well. As we’ve recently witnessed, the Academy Awards show was completely overrun by PC politics.  Every year it seems we see less entertainment and more political posturing by people paid to entertain us – not to deliver political lectures. This year, the ratings for the Oscars continued to plunge, down 20 percent from last year.  You would think liberal politicians, PC executives and Hollywood would’ve all gotten the memo by now: America’s backlash against political correctness is one reason why President Trump got elected. But these people don’t deal in facts. They’d rather double down and continue their bully tactics.  Freitas called for an honest dialogue of mutual respect in his speech, yet Democrats walked out. Democratic Delegate Joseph Lindsey said Freitas’ speech offended him more than he’s ever been offended since being elected to the House of Delegates, and Democratic Delegate Lamont Bagby said Freitas’ comments were “hateful and divisive.”  Specifically the Democrats were offended when Freitas argued the facts when pushing back against the character assassination of on the left. Freitas said: \"It was not our party that supported slavery, that fought women\\'s suffrage, that rounded up tens of thousands of Asian Americans and put them in concentrations camps, that supported Jim Crow, that supported segregation, or supported mass resistance – that wasn\\'t our party, that was the Democrat Party.”  The truth hurts.  This is the road of “tolerance,” laced with political correctness and rank hypocrisy, that says we can call you a Nazi and a segregationist but when you throw facts back at us and try to have a respectful dialogue, that road becomes a one-way street.  Freitas spoke passionately about looking beyond gun control as a solution to school shootings. He noted that gun-free zones have not deterred gun violence in schools. In addition, he encouraged long overdue scrutiny into policies enacted by liberals that have led to broken homes.  In this age of politically correct overreach attempting to infiltrate every part of society, it is a breath of fresh air to see an elected leader with the courage to start an honest, respectful dialogue built upon undeniable truths.  Delegate Freitas displayed courage we can only hope to have when he served in Iraq as a soldier defending our country. It’s refreshing to see a leader who won’t be bullied by politicians in a state legislature – or the U.S. Senate, where we just might see him next year.'"
