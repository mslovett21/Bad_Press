GLEN DALE, W.Va. - Democratic candidate for the United States Senate Paula Jean Swearengin made a campaign stop in the Ohio Valley on Thursday.

Swearengin visited with employees who are on strike outside of Tecnocap in Glen Dale.

"This is the second union in the building. The first union was locked out. I came down here just to give some attention to what's going on," Swearengin said. "The workers can't talk right now. The union's not really talking cause they're in negation, but I'm just down here in solidarity."

Swearengin also spoke about her campaign, saying she's a coal miner's daughter and granddaughter who is proud of her heritage and wants to see prosperity brought back to West Virginia.

"I want to be a candidate because I'm tired of the corruption in this state," she added. "I'm an ordinary person running for office. We see people from the local level to the federal level uh stepping up and wanting to be public servants. I want to bring this country back to it's intention, by the people, for the people and of the people.

Swearengin is running against Joe Manchin, who currently holds that seat on the U.S. Senate.
