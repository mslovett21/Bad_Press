WEIRTON, W. Va. — The U.S. Senate race in the West Virginia GOP Primary is a crowded field, but there's one candidate who's hoping to stand out with his plain-spoken approach to politics.

Jack Newbrough is often found at the American Legion Weirton.

"This place is special to my heart,” Newbrough said. “It's one of those places that I enjoy coming to; I like to hang around the vets and have a good time and hear their stories."

For any veteran at the Weirton American Legion: they know Jack.

"I’ve seen him here in action in town and I think he would be an asset to what we've got in there right now,” said WWII Navy veteran Ralph Wyatt.

Wyatt thinks his fellow sailor could represent blue collar workers in Congress.

"He's aggressive and he's honest,” Wyatt said. “And I just think he's got good character. I think he'd be good for the job.”

Polling at 4 percent in the GOP field of six candidates, Newbrough has been trying to break through, posting Facebook videos after his shifts on the road.

"I’m tired of West Virginia being a stepping stone for somebody's political career,” he said. “And I think that the people of West Virginia and in the country are tired of politicians in general, and that's what I’m trying to say to voters, 'I am just like you.' I am an individual that makes $42,000 a year."

While the vets have fun, they say Newbrough won't play games in Congress.

"He's a fighter. He's a go-getter,” said Vietnam veteran Ron Haggerty. “He's aggressive and I think he's got some good goals in mind."

"We need change there, and I think he'd be a good candidate for the change,” Wyatt said.

Newbrough is picking up his ground game next week starting with a spur of debates - four of them - starting in Fairmont Tuesday.
