A Republican candidate for Senate in Virginia is going viral for his passionate defense of gun rights and fiery criticism of Democrats.

Nick Freitas, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates who is one of several Republicans running to take on Sen. Tim Kaine (R-Va.), spoke Friday on the Virginia House floor, slamming Democrats for suggesting that people who hold pro-Second Amendment views are "Nazis" or "segregationists" who have blood on their hands in the wake of the Florida high school shooting.

"If we want to have an open and honest debate, I'm all for that. Let's do that. But it does start with a certain degree of mutual respect," Freitas said. "It starts with a certain degree of not assuming that the only reason we believe in the Second Amendment is because the NRA paid us off. Well, if that's the sort of logic you want to use, why don't you go take a look at how much money the NRA spends and how much money Planned Parenthood spends?"

He posted a video of his remarks on his Facebook page on Friday, and it has already racked up more than 12 million views.


On "Fox & Friends" on Monday, Freitas explained that he had grown tired of the rhetoric some on the left had been using, so he decided to speak out.

He noted that some Democrats walked out during his speech, and Del. Joseph Lindsey (D-Norfolk) said many people were "emotionally shaken" by Freitas' words.

“More and more, offense is used as a weapon with which to turn away debate,” Freitas said. “And I’m not going to accept that.”

He said he intended no offense and he's open to meeting with his colleagues across the aisle to discuss how they can better work together.

"We have to be honest about what's really going on in our schools and going on in our communities. And I'm not going to accept this false narrative that constantly gets thrown at Republicans and conservatives because we support Second Amendment rights," Freitas said.
