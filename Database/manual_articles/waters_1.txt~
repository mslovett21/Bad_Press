ALEXANDRIA, Va., May 4, 2018 /Standard Newswire/ -- Libertarian nominee for US Senate, Matt Waters, voiced his support for GOP Candidate Ivan Raiklin's lawsuit against John Findlay, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia, and others.

Waters said, "The Constitution has a few simple requirements in order to run for the United States Senate: that you be thirty years old, a resident of the state, and a citizen for nine years."

"The state of Virginia, and in particular the two political parties, have added several additional and nearly impossible requirements in order to run for statewide office: you must collect 10,000 signatures, 4,400 must be from each one of Virginia's 11 congressional districts, and all signatures must be from registered voters."

"In order to accomplish these additional burdens to run for office, the Republican and Democrat parties have erected a 'Wall of Separation' between the voters and their chosen candidates. Make no mistake, what Republicans and Democrats are saying to Virginians is: 'Regular citizens, whose career is not shameless self-promotion, raising taxes or running up the debt, they are not welcome to run for office.'"

"Shame on the GOP for playing politics and excluding one of their own in the primary. But this is not new for the Virginian Republican Party. The GOP in Virginia has a long history of double-dealing and back-stabbing. One need only point to Lt. Col Oliver North's race for Senate, and the abysmal treatment to Lt. Gov. candidate Mike Farris. Both were rejected by the Establishment GOP and lost their bids for office."

"It is my hope that Ivan Raiklin's lawsuit prevail over the special interests in Richmond who have actively worked to keep ordinary people out of the political process."

Waters' campaign is actively collecting signatures from registered Virginian voters.

"The ballot access process costs candidates, at a minimum, $25,000. My guess is ninety percent of Virginians are excluded because of this unreasonably high threshold to run for office. And its a sad day for liberty when a regular guy like Raiklin plays by the rules, and appears to have been sent packing by the GOP. The Libertarian Party welcomes all people, regardless of their status."
