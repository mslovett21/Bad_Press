ALEXANDRIA, Va., Feb. 21, 2018 /Standard Newswire/ -- Activist Matt Waters announced today that he is seeking the Libertarian nomination for U.S. Senate in Virginia.

Waters is a long time Libertarian Party member who is currently serving as an executive at Students For Liberty, an international libertarian students organization based in Washington, D.C. Prior to joining Students For Liberty, he worked at the Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University.

"The GOP made it very clear with the recent budget deal that they have abandoned all fiscal restraint, including a balanced budget. Now the president is floating a $.25 gas tax to pay for it. Mike Dukakis and John Kerry would be proud.

"I want to give American workers a seven to ten percent pay raise by ending the federal income tax and replacing it with nothing. We have to choose. Which is more important, being forced to pay for the Department of Education and Agriculture, or keeping more of our hard-earned money? Our paychecks do not belong to Washington. They belong to us. It is our money, our property."

Waters' slogan, "The Virginian," references the fact that he is the only announced candidate in the race for U.S. Senate who was born and raised in Virginia, and whose family dates back to 1607 in Jamestown, Virginia.

"Virginia's motto, 'Sic Semper Tyrannis' is emblazoned upon our state flag. And my campaign for U.S. Senate will fly under the banner of Virginia, 'Thus Always to Tyrants.' The tyrant today is no king, it is a massive welfare-warfare state funded by taxpayers. I am calling on Virginians to help me abolish the income tax, cut and privatize current federal programs, including bringing U.S. troops home, and close multiple federal departments."

Matt is married to Anne Marie and together they homeschool their five children. Matt also serves as an Assistant Scout Master in Boy Scouts of America, he is an active member in Gideons International, and is a lifetime member of the NRA.
