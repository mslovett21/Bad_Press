Right Wing Watch reports on 2018 Virginia GOP U.S. Senate candidate Ewwwwww Jackson’s latest lunacy and bizarre historical revisionism (see partial transcript and video, below). Sadly, it’s not surprising that a rabidly anti-Muslim bigot like Ewwwww would go in this direction, but still…WTF? I presume that the Virginia GOP will boot Ewwww out of their party, just like they booted out this guy (well, sort of; he’s in a leadership position in the Fairfax GOP)? No, of course they won’t. Nor will Ewwww’s fellow U.S. Senate candidates, neo-Confederate Corey and Freaky Freitas, condemn him. Another day in the life of the batshit-crazy Virginia GOP…

And I know this is not politically correct, and I hope the press will get this right. It was actually Arab Muslims who were the first to enslave sub-Saharan Africans. And by the way, it was Arab Muslims who were the first to create racial ideology, because they invented a word that was intended to convey being both a black African and a slave, the word is abid…in fact there are modern Muslims who tell other Muslims they should never use that word because it is the equivalent of the “n-word” in Arabic. It was NOT Europeans who came up with racial ideology, it was Arab Muslims. It was not Europeans who started the African slave trade; the Portugese were the first [Europeans] to engage in it, but they learned it from them! And by the way, it could not have happened without the cooperation of Africans…
