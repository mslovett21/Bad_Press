HANCOCK COUNTY, W. Va. — Weirton resident Jack Newbrough held a meet-and-greet at the Millsop Community Center.

Newbrough is running for U.S. Senate. On Saturday, West Virginia residents came out to ask questions and learn more about Newbrough.

He said he's focusing on a few different topics throughout his campaign.

"Veterans, law enforcement and first responders in there,” Newbrough said. “Number 2 I definitely will fight. If I’m ever elected, the first thing I will do is sign a bill to put term limits on Congress. There's no excuse for somebody to be in congress for 40 years."

Newbrough also said it's been at least twenty years since someone in the northern panhandle has ran for senator.
