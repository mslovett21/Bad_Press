A Republican U.S. Senate candidate came to WVU on Saturday to urge students to get involved in the upcoming election.

"If I can impact you guys and you impact other people, together we can make a change in our state," said Tom Willis, who seeks to win the May 8 Republican primary election.

This town hall comes weeks before the contested Republican primary election, with six candidates vying for the chance to represent the GOP in the general election.

"It’s very refreshing, and I think that it’s incredibly important for voter education," said Riley Keaton, chairman of the WVU College Republicans. "You have the opportunity to escape the 2018-style of politics where you’re on constantly on edge with dealing with Twitter mobs."

In a town hall hosted by WVU College Republicans, Willis spoke to a crowd of 30 in the Mountainlair.

Willis shared his experiences as a business owner and a Green Beret veteran, and how they relate to his capabilities in running for office.

"West Virginia is at a point where it needs leadership. We need to change the culture," he said. "West Virginians need to believe in themselves again."

Jordan Covelli, a junior accounting student and member of the WVU Republicans, said it was nice to have a personal conversation with the candidate.

"It was an intimate discussion and we got to ask some questions and learn more about [Willis]," Covelli said.

Willis called for several changes the federal government needed to make to help the economy, and cited Tennessee’s recent success in free market reforms.

He called for:

•Lower taxes

•Cutting through red tape that messes with bus owners

•Keep government costs as low as possible

•Regulatory stability

"Do these things [and] businesses will come, and the state will prosper," Willis said.
