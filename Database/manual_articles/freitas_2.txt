One of the Republican candidates facing Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) in November blasted Virginia's governor after he vetoed a bill that would have banned sanctuary cities in the Old Dominion.

Prince William County Chairman Corey Stewart said it is unthinkable that Gov. Ralph Northam (D) would make such a move in a state that is afflicted by MS-13 violence.

Laura Ingraham said Northam campaigned as a moderate in the 2017 governor's race, in which he beat progressive former Rep. Tom Perriello (D-Albemarle) in the primary and former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie in the general election.

State Delegate Mark Levine (D-Alexandria) told Stewart that the bill would've prevented some people in immigrant communities from coming forward to report violent crimes because they'd fear deportation.

"No one would celebrate more than MS-13," Levine said.

Northam defended his veto by saying the "unnecessary and divisive" bill would've made local law enforcement responsible for enforcing and expending extra resources to federal immigration law.

Stewart said Levine's line of thought is "what the left always does."

"It has no basis in truth," Stewart, who faces State Delegate Nick Freitas (R-Culpeper) and Bishop E.W. Jackson (R-Chesapeake) in the primary, said.

Stewart ripped Northam's decision, saying that in his 10 years leading Prince William County - a Washington suburb that includes Woodbridge and Dumfries - more than 8,100 illegal immigrants have been handed over to ICE and the crime rate "dropped in half."

Stewart said that in bordering Fairfax County, lax illegal immigration policies have led to a greater problem with groups like MS-13.

Ingraham played tape of MS-13 member Venus Iraheta, 17, confessing to the brutal stabbing death of another teen in Fairfax.

Stewart said that under his leadership, Prince William County engaged in one of the "toughest illegal immigration crackdowns in the country."
