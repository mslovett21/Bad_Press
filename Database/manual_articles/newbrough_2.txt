Jack Newbrough, one of the candidates running for the Republican nomination to challenge West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D), said during a debate on Monday that he’d like to waterboard opioid dealers.

“When looking at this epidemic I might be a little bit stronger ... catching the dealers and the pushers, I’d like to take them out back and waterboard them,” Newbrough said during the debate.

“That might not be the right thing to say, but I think that is a start in the direction to get it taken care of,” he added.

Newbrough is a long-shot candidate currently trying to get the Republican nomination to take on Manchin, who is considered one of 2018's most endangered Democratic senators. Newbrough isn't expected to win a significant share of primary votes, with the race coming down to a three-way contest between Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.), state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and former coal magnate Don Blankenship.


Newbrough noted that he feels so strongly about the issue because he has a personal connection to the opioid crisis.

“Everyone up here knows this one’s a personal issue with me. My son's mother lost her life to opioid addiction 10 years ago,” Newbrough said.

West Virginia has been one of the states hit the worst by the opioid crisis currently ravaging communities across America.

The West Virginia open primary will be held on May 8.
