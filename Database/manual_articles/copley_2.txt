WILLIAMSON, W.Va. (WV MetroNews) -- More than a month after he said on Facebook he will run for U.S. Senate, former coal miner Bo Copley announced Monday in Mingo County he will challenge Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., in 2018.

Copley, who gained national attention following a May 2016 forum with then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is running for the Republican Party’s nomination.

“Our so-called leaders are looking solely for positions of stature and power,” he said. “Their greed has caused them to lose sight of a fundamental truth of a republican government, which is that they are in Washington to serve the people, and not their own political and financial interests.”

Copley, 40, spoke at the Mountaineer Hotel in Williamson.

He was laid off in September 2015 from Arch Coal after 11 years with the company.

Copley confronted Clinton during a CNN town hall regarding a statement she made months prior.
