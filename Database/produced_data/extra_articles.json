[{"article_text":"A former coal industry worker plans to challenge West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) in 2018.  Bo Copley announced his intentions Tuesday, exactly one year after gaining attention for confronting Hillary Clinton over her past remarks about shrinking the coal industry.  \u201cIt\u2019s what God\u2019s telling me to do,\u201d he said about his Senate bid to Yahoo News.  \u201cWith everything that has happened over the past year, with all of the attention we have received, with all of the people saying, \u2018We really appreciate you representing us,\u2019 we thought maybe people want someone to represent them who understands what they\u2019re going through.\u201d Copley, 40, said he is filing some of the preliminary paperwork necessary for launching a Senate campaign next year.  The former maintenance planner and fill-in foreman would need to win West Virginia\u2019s Republican primary before potentially unseating Manchin.  Tuesday\u2019s announcement comes one year after Copley emotionally confronted Clinton during a campaign roundtable in Williamson, W.Va.  \u201cI just want you to know: How can you say you\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners out of jobs and then come in here and tell us you\u2019re going to be our friend?\u201d he asked Clinton, then the Democratic presidential frontrunner.  \u201cI want my family to know that they have a future in this state because it is a great state,\u201d Copley added, while handing Clinton a photograph of his loved ones.  Clinton angered the coal industry in March 2016 by talking about putting it out of business.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of companies and coal miners out of business,\u201d she said while calling for \u201cclean, renewable energy.\u201d  Clinton said during May 2016 encounter with Copley that she made \u201ca misstatement\u201d about her energy plans.  Manchin is a top target of Republicans after President Trump bested Clinton by a resounding 42 points in West Virginia on Election Night.

Copley gained nationwide popularity when he questioned Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton about her stance on coal at a roundtable discussion at a local health clinic in Williamson in the spring of 2016.  Fast forward a few months and Copley, a former employee in the coal industry, said he felt a strong spiritual force urging him to run for political office. He announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in May of last year.  Copley will face current U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins of Huntington and current W.Va. Attorney General Patrick Morrissey in the May primary election. Now former coal executive Don Blankenship has thrown his hat into the ring, which makes for a crowded field. The GOP winner will likely face incumbent U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who also has served as the Mountain State's governor. Manchin has some opposition in the Democratic primary, but is expected to be his party's nominee.  All four of those candidates have huge campaign funds. In contrast, Copley, who was laid off in September 2015 from Arch Coal, has a grassroots campaign underway. He realizes he won't have the big budgets the other candidates have, but he isn't worried.  \"I've run into several people who have said, 'You're not going to be able to compete with them,' \" Copley said. \"But I try to point out to them that money doesn't win a race - it's votes. If enough people are tired of seeing candidates win because they have more money or they have corporate people in their back pockets - we are giving them another option.\"  He wants people in the state to get a different mindset.  \"I'm not going to get the backing from corporate representatives, and I'm not going to get huge donations from people who are going to expect favors in return. We are getting most of our money from everyday people,\" Copley said of his working-class candidacy. He said he would never ask the salt of the earth type citizens to donate to his campaign because he knows how it is like to live check to check. But, he says when he gets $25 or $50 from someone - \"it says a lot. I know at the end of the day people are going to look back and say, 'He is one of us.' \"  \"We are giving voters a chance to get away from the stereotypical candidate,\" Copley added.  The Mingo County native said he recently joked at an event in Harrison County, which was also attended by Morrisey. \"When I got up to speak, I asked if anyone else wanted to throw their hat into the ring before we get started.\"  The filing period for West Virginia candidates begins Monday, Jan. 8, and ends Saturday, Jan. 27.  \"Everyone has the opportunity to run,\" Copley said. He said if everyone stays in the race, he thinks it will help him in the long run. \"That brings down the total number of votes you need to win,\" he said of the crowded GOP race. \"For someone like myself that is underfunded - it can help me.\"  Copley will likely get support from the evangelical population of the state.  \"I think people in our state, that aren't necessarily Christians in our state, still respect those values,\" Copley said. \"I'm not saying I'm better than any other person - by no means. We need to get people to elect candidates not based on their political affiliations or because of their name recognition. We hope they will vote for people because of their character and what they stand for.\"  Copley, 40, of Lenore, hopes to be the Republican candidate to challenge Manchin in the 2018 U.S. Senate general election. Copley said what makes him different is that he knows what it's like to be unemployed and sees the struggles coal mining families and others in Appalachia have had in order to make ends meet.  \"My entire life I have watched people run for these offices that have no idea how it is to live payday to payday,\" Copley said. \"They don't know what most of us live through each day. You can call that grassroots - but honestly it is just a common sense choice. Do you want someone who has a similar background and that has worked every day?\"  He discussed how President Donald Trump was able to gain support and win the nomination and then the presidency. Copley said it is a good example that voters may be changing their views on the types of candidates they want to support. \"He definitely wasn't the conventional candidate.  \"People are tired of career politicians. They want average citizens to run for these offices. I don't think you get more average everyday than myself,\" he said with a smile.  Copley said one positive came from losing his job in the mining industry. It has helped him spend more time with his wife and kids. He also volunteers at a private Christian school, Ambassador Christian Academy in Williamson. He said he had been working 11 to 12 hours a day and missed a lot of time with his family.  \"I felt like I was at a place where God would open the door for me. It is hard for people who are not believers to understand where I come from,\" Copley said. \"I felt like He would show me the right opportunity. I didn't know that this was the opportunity he was going to present to me.\"  Of his underdog status, Copley said his chances are \"better than ever.\"  \"It would be easy to sit back and look at the campaign funds they have and at their experience - but in today's world, that experience is as much a handicap as it is a benefit.  \"I think in May there are going to be a lot of people who are surprised. But I'm not going to be one of them,\" Copley said.  According to Copley's issue statements on his campaign website, he pledges to \"promote coal, oil and gas as the common sense solutions to America's energy needs\" and work for immigration reform. On health care, he says he opposes Obamacare but will \"fight for affordable health care for all West Virginia families and work to re-introduce competition in the marketplace.\"  Copley favors tax reform, opposes abortion and says he will work to protect the West Virginia environment.","articles_date":"5 1 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.williamsondailynews.com\/news\/bo-copley-talks-about-his-senate-campaign\/article_d0e31758-6866-50b5-93bb-8b70de1c3e71.html","articles_title":"Bo Copley talks about his Senate campaign","candidate_fk":2,"first_name":"Bo","id":1,"last_name":"Copley","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":1},{"article_text":"CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 A former Mingo County coal miner, vying for the seat of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), says he wants to represent the thousands of West Virginians impacted by the downturn in coal.  \u201cWho would be better to run against someone that people have had enough of then somebody who is the exact opposite?\u201d said Bo Copley in an interview with MetroNews Wednesday.

Copley, 40, of Delbarton, wants to challenge Manchin in the 2018 U.S. Senate race. He announced his run for the Republican ticket in a Facebook video with his wife Tuesday.  Copley became a household name in the 2016 presidential campaign when he confronted then-Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton about her stance on coal after hearing her say in a CNN Town Hall the month before: \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d Clinton later apologized to Copley and told him she misspoke.  But seeing Manchin beside Clinton at the Williamson Town Hall \u2014 where hundreds of protesters lined the street \u2014 \u201cdidn\u2019t sit right\u201d with Copley. He said Manchin\u2019s \u201cunwavering support\u201d of the former Secretary of State was enough to motivate him to run for office.  Copley said he showed Clinton a picture of his children that day to represent the future of a now-dying coal industry in the Mountain State.  \u201cHow can you make comments about taking jobs away from people and look at the children of those people in the face and still be able to make those kind of comments?\u201d he reflected.  Throughout his campaign Copley said he plans to focus on diversifying the economy. He said he believes coal will never rebound to what it was a decade ago and that West Virginians need new career paths in order to stay in state.  \u201cI want my kids to be able to grow up here and say \u2018I want to make a living, but I don\u2019t want to work in a coal mine.\u2019 Well, guess what?

He was laid off in Sept. 2015 from Arch Coal after working there for 11 years.  \u201cI think my story resonates with the people in this state because I think most people in this state have lead the same types of things in the last couple of years,\u201d he said.  \u201cYou walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes \u2014 you tend to fight for that person a little harder than what you might have in the past and I think I wear the same shoes as a lot of people.\u201d","articles_date":"3 5 2017","articles_link":"http:\/\/wvmetronews.com\/2017\/05\/03\/laid-off-miner-running-for-u-s-senate-says-he-is-exact-opposite-of-sen-manchin\/","articles_title":"Laid-off miner running for U.S. Senate says he is \u201cexact opposite\u201d of Sen.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced Monday that the Trump administration is moving to scrap the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulatory program to curb emissions from coal-fired power plants.  On \"Fox & Friends,\" Copley said Trump is doing his best to revitalize the coal industry, which was devastated by the Obama administration.  He said he's already seen evidence on the ground of the industry making a turnaround, as coal companies look for more workers and coal transport increases.  \"The little nuisances that we thought were nuisances - being behind 18-wheelers hauling our product or being caught behind coal trains - we got kind of used to them not being on the roads and being on the tracks anymore. And now that we're getting hung up behind them again, people don't seem to mind as much as we did before,\" Copley said.  \"We're extremely grateful for the president and Mr. Pruitt,\" Copley added, explaining that communities that rely on coal feel like their voices are finally being heard.

The four underdog candidates also generally skipped out on TV broadcasts and direct mailers.  Bo Copley, Jack Newbrough and Tom Willis, Republican primary candidates, said they\u2019ve been left at the margin. They say the polls that decided who makes the debates favor the establishment candidates, and they deserve a fair shake.  Likewise, they say the leading contenders, Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va., state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, all have so much political baggage that they may leave room for an outside candidate to eke in.  However, all the Republican candidates had at least one debate to make their case, a luxury not afforded to Paula Jean Swearengin, who is facing Sen. Joe Manchin in the Democratic primary.  The Gazette-Mail spoke to the lesser-known candidates in the primary over the past week to tell their stories.  Tom Willis Tom Willis was not featured on a debate aired by WSAZ-TV, but his hat was.  \u201cThe hat is because Tom Willis is not here based on surveys I\u2019m not sure are independent,\u201d Blankenship said from under a white \u201cTom Willis for U.S. Senate\u201d baseball cap. \u201cHe\u2019s a veteran, he\u2019s a good guy, he deserves an equal chance to unseat the entitlement, or establishment, if you will.\u201d  Explaining the unusual choice of political apparel from an adversary, Willis said he had been talking to Blankenship at a political luncheon earlier in the day and teased that he had a special gift for him \u2014 the now infamous hat. Blankenship said he\u2019d wear it, which Willis called a noble gesture, but didn\u2019t think it would happen.  \u201cI thought for sure his staff, there\u2019s no way they\u2019d let him go on with that hat,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not expect to see it, really. But sure enough, he showed up and he wore it.\u201d  Before launching his campaign, Willis worked as a tax attorney for Baker & McKenzie, a multinational law firm. He left to enlist in the National Guard, starting as an enlisted infantryman and working up to his current rank and role as a major and a Green Beret.  After leaving the firm, Willis worked as a venture capitalist and as the current co-owner of the historic Glen Ferris Inn. He continues to serve in the Guard.  Willis isn\u2019t shy to vent about his treatment in the election. He says polling conducted by Fox News and GOPAC are establishment-centered, used to stifle outside threats.  \u201cThe system really is rigged to favor incumbents, to favor people in the establishment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe media, naturally, is biased toward giving them more credibility. The chattering class, if you will, the chattering class talks to the media, the media talks to the chattering class and talks to the establishment candidates, and it just goes around in a circle.\u201d  Between his military experience, work as a tax attorney and know-how in the business world, Willis said he is as qualified as the leading three, minus the dirt built up from years in politics, lobbying or criminal convictions.  Jack Newbrough The 2018 Senate campaign did not kill Jack Newbrough, but it came close.  After watching the WSAZ-TV debate, stressed and exhausted from campaign travels, Newbrough woke up around 3 a.m. feeling a \u201cheaviness\u201d in his chest.  The Navy veteran and truck driver checked himself into a VA health facility, then a full hospital where doctors told him he suffered a minor heart attack with 40 percent blockage \u2014 below the threshold for needing a stent.  The diagnosis came on a Wednesday. He showed up at a GOP dinner in Kanawha County that Friday.  \u201cI feel fine, I played golf yesterday,\u201d he said before a debate April 30.  He used a cart in lieu of walking the greens. He said his drives were on, but his short-game was off.  Newbrough has proven to be the cowboy of the race. While discussing gun rights at a debate in Wheeling, he said he\u2019s the only candidate on stage who was actually carrying a firearm at the time. That was before he advocated waterboarding people convicted of dealing drugs.  \u201cIt was a figure of speech. I didn\u2019t think it would be taken literally,\u201d he said before a debate in which he repeated the idea.  While an unfeasible solution for several reasons, Newbrough said it came up because the opioid epidemic hits close to home for him. He lost his wife, and his son lost his mother, to an opioid addiction.  Adding to his wildcard style, he said at the debate his number one goal is to make sure Morrisey does not win the nomination. He said he will not back Morrisey. Prior to the debate, he said every other candidate in the race, along with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., sent him wishes for good health while he was in the hospital \u2014 every candidate besides Morrisey.  He said Willis even visited him in person.  Morrisey did, however, issue his condolences on Twitter.  Newbrough said he would be a senator in touch with the people who would protect Americans\u2019 gun rights and protect the right to life.  Bo Copley Fox has Bo Copley polling at 2 percent, but the former coal miner is still feeling confident.  \u201cEverywhere we go, we run into more people saying, \u2018I really like what you have to say,\u2019\u201d he said.  Copley found himself in the spotlight during the 2016 presidential primary when he scored an invite to a roundtable-style campaign event for Hillary Clinton.  There, he challenged Clinton for saying \u201cwe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d  Reading the full quote, in context, it\u2019s clear Clinton was talking about using renewable energy as a vessel to bring economic opportunity to areas suffering from the loss of coal jobs. Nonetheless, the incident underscored the trouble Clinton had connecting with voters in Appalachian areas and a personal distaste for her brand that lingers today.  He pointed to the spat as evidence that he\u2019s not afraid of anyone, but can treat those he disagrees with in a civil and respectful manner.  \u201cI don\u2019t care who I\u2019m faced with, when it comes to my state and it comes to my home, I\u2019ll stand up to anyone in this country the way that I did with Hillary,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do it in a respectful manner, people will hear what you have to say.\u201d  Copley said a lot of people don\u2019t like any of the three leading candidates. His real challenge is finding those people and letting them know he\u2019s out there.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry about polls, don\u2019t worry about who matches up better, voting is about you and what suits you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever your needs are, you need to vote according to your needs. The rest will shake out.\u201d  Paula Jean Swearengin \u201cThe working class needs working class representation, I\u2019ve said that over and over and over,\u201d Paula Jean Swearengin said Friday of her senatorial campaign.  Beating Manchin in a primary, Swearengin said, will be a bigger challenge than beating whoever wins the Republican primary.  Running on a platform that includes a push for renewable energy jobs, union support and campaign finance reform, the irony of the chance she runs against Blankenship, who fought unions for years in the mining industry and has a track record of environmental pollution, has not escaped her.  \u201cHe rightfully needs his butt kicked by a coal miner\u2019s daughter,\u201d Swearengin said of Blankenship.  Though Manchin said publicly that he would debate Swearengin during the primary, it has never happened.  Swearengin said this lack of debate was a political calculation.  \u201cI think that it\u2019s telling that Joe Manchin won\u2019t debate me, because I think that he\u2019s afraid that I\u2019ll get more name recognition,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest challenge is name recognition in this campaign.\u201d  Along with the policy differences, Swearengin said Manchin needs to be taken to task for his role in propping up Gov. Jim Justice in his 2016 election, before he switched to the Republican party in 2017.  Swearengin is the only candidate in the race pushing a Medicare-for-all plan. She said she\u2019s confident in her chances.  More than any party affiliation, she said her authenticity as a member of and advocate for the working class will span any political divide in the state.  Backing Swearengin is Brand New Congress, a PAC formed by veterans of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, though that\u2019s not her only run-in with the senator from Vermont. A video of her chatting with Sanders that ends in a tender hug made the rounds during the presidential campaign.","articles_date":"5 5 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.wvgazettemail.com\/election_2018\/congress_2018\/lesser-known-wv-candidates-in-us-senate-race-make-their\/article_9d6c0499-6d25-5754-9ef7-75b06061cfce.html","articles_title":"Lesser-known WV candidates in US Senate race make their case","candidate_fk":6,"first_name":"Jack","id":6,"last_name":"Newbrough","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":3},{"article_text":"Jack Newbrough, one of the candidates running for the Republican nomination to challenge West Virginia Sen.

He served a year in prison for his conviction for misdemeanor conspiracy to violate federal safety standards at a West Virginia mine where 29 miners died in 2010. Blankenship has long maintained his innocence.  Morrisey was quick to agree with Trump, tweeting he is \"exactly right. @DonBlankenship would be a disaster for West Virginia and would get trounced by @Sen_JoeManchin.\"  Blankenship issued a statement in response to the president's tweet, saying Trump is \"a very busy man and he doesn\u2019t know me, and he doesn\u2019t know how flawed my two main opponents are in this primary.\"  \"The establishment is misinforming him because they do not want me to be in the U.S. Senate and promote the president\u2019s agenda,\" Blankenship continued in his statement. \"West Virginians are not going to vote for candidates who have failed to address the drug epidemic, aligned themselves with abortionists, and have never created a job. I will win the primary and I will beat Joe Manchin.  \"West Virginians want more jobs, an end to the drug epidemic, and an honest government. I will will do the job that Morrisey and Jenkins can\u2019t do and have not done. I am the only candidate that has beaten Joe Manchin, and I have done it twice. In the history of West Virginia, no one has been more supportive of the Republican Party and conservative causes than I have been. Neither of my opponents can beat Joe Manchin without my support, but I will beat Joe Manchin even without the support of the establishment.  \"West Virginia voters should remember that my enemies are Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and my opponents would not even be running as Republicans had I not resurrected the Republican Party in West Virginia. Tomorrow, West Virginia will send the swamp a message\u2014no one, and I mean no one, will tell us how to vote. As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump and this morning proves it.\"  One of Blankenship\u2019s most recent campaign ads takes a jab at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Eyewitness News I-Team did a fact check of the ad, which many are concerned is racist.  Donald Trump Jr. tweeted last week West Virginia voters should \u201creject Blankenship.\u201d  \u201cI hate to lose,\u201d the tweet posted on May 3 said. \u201cSo I'm gonna go out on a limb here and ask the people of West Virginia to make a wise decision and reject Blankenship!

They decided they would treat me with medication.  \u201cThey released me \u2014 but with a bunch of medications,\u201d he said.  He was planning to attend a Kanawha County Lincoln Day Dinner on Friday night in Charleston, then return to Weirton.  Newbrough, 48, a truck driver from Weirton, has been given clearance by his doctors to drive a car and he will be able to drive himself home. He is not, however, permitted to drive his rig for two weeks.  Newbrough said after Monday night\u2019s debate, he went to on Tuesday to events in Beckley and Huntington.  At about 3 a.m. Wednesday, he said he awoke in his hotel room with \u201ca heavy feeling\u201d but not pain.  \u201cThere was a lot of pressure on my chest,\u201d he said. \u201cI drove myself to the emergency room at (the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Huntington). They don\u2019t do heart catherizations there, so they sent me to St. Mary\u2019s.  \u201cI never had any pain, just an uncomfortable feeling,\u201d he said.  Doctors at the St. Mary Medical Center told Newbrough he had to quit smoking, and he said he hasn\u2019t had a cigarette in three days.  He said four of the five other candidates in the race reached out to him while he was in the hospital in Huntington. Those contacting him were Don Blankenship, Bo Copley, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and Tom Willis. Newbrough said he did not hear from State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.  Newbrough\u2019s heart attack happened less than 30 hours after he participated Monday night in a debate at Wheeling Jesuit University sponsored by The Intelligencer and Wheeling News-Register.","articles_date":"28 4 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.theintelligencer.net\/news\/top-headlines\/2018\/04\/u-s-senate-candidate-jack-newbrough-recovers-from-heart-attack\/","articles_title":"U.S. Senate Candidate Jack Newbrough Recovers From Heart Attack","candidate_fk":6,"first_name":"Jack","id":6,"last_name":"Newbrough","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":8},{"article_text":"Weirton native, United States Navy veteran and professional truck driver Jack Newbrough threw his hat in the race for Senate \u201cto make West Virginia first.\u201d  Newbrough describes himself as a \u201cblue collar guy\u201d and hopes that West Virginia is looking for a change in the Senate.  \u201cMy main reason for running is that I\u2019m just tired of West Virginia being last or next to last in every category there is throughout the country,\u201d Newbrough said.  \u201cI\u2019m just a blue collar guy like the majority of West Virginia people are right now. They live pay day to pay day, go to work and struggle to pay their bills and everything else. I\u2008just think it\u2019s time for somebody who can relate to them in closer manner than just being a politician who goes to D.C. and looks out for their own interest and not the people of West Virginia.\u201d  First and foremost, Newbrough said that his top priority is to take care of the West Virginia veterans and \u201ctake on the VA to get it back where it should be.\u201d He said that he will make sure that the veterans\u2019 healthcare is \u201ctaken care of.\u201d  Secondly, he wants to tackle the opioid epidemic facing West Virginia and the rest of the nation. Newbrough said that West Virginia needs to create more funding for rehabilitation centers and available law enforcement needs to \u201ccrack down on the dealers and pushers who are bringing it into our state.\u201d  \u201cI\u2008don\u2019t think there\u2019s an actual cure for the opioid addiction unless they truly want to come off of it and take care of it themselves, but there has to be some other ways with them talking to more medical professionals who have the experience,\u201d Newbrough said.  \u201cWe need to make sure that funding is there that they can help them with that addiction and can get the help that they need. I\u2019ve been asking around all over and talking to the professionals, but nobody\u2019s able to give me a true answer. I\u2019m not a doctor by no means, but I\u2019m trying to find the answers for them.\u201d  As far as providing the appropriate law enforcement, Newbrough said that through talking with state legislators, he found out that the state will be having a police academy in July for the first time in almost four years. So, Newbrough believes that the state will be able to put more law enforcement out on the roads to control the highways around the statelines to \u201cattack\u201d the problem in that way.  Newbrough said that the current opioid crisis is playing a major role in the current state of the economy.  \u201cEverything right now is focused around the opioid problem in the state, especially with the fact the natural gas is booming and the oil drilling and everything like that, but the people of West Virginia can\u2019t pass a drug screening to get these higher-paying jobs to go to work,\u201d Newbrough said. \u201cSo you have to tackle that problem first.\u201d  Coming from a family of small business owners, Newbrough said he is supportive of small businesses in the state and maintaining that as part of the economy.  In addition, West Virginia\u2019s supply of natural gas will play a huge part in the economy of the state, according to Newbrough.  Newbrough\u2019s campaign has mostly consisted of traveling around the state reaching out to voters on a \u201cpersonal level.\u201d  \u201cAll I\u2008do is go out and travel in my semi,\u201d\u2008Newbrough said. \u201cI\u2019m not spending any money on advertising. I\u2019m not putting any signs up. Basically all I\u2008carry is a business card, and I\u2008feel that resonates with people.\u201d  When asked why the people of West Virginia should vote for him, Newbrough simply said, \u201cBecause I\u2019m just like them.\u201d  \u201cI have no idea where I\u2008stand at the polls. I\u2008can\u2019t afford to do it, but I know that the people reaching out support me by just a handshake,\u201d Newbrough said.  \u201cI take that to heart when somebody shakes your hand and tells you they support you. They actually mean it. I\u2019m just a truck driver and Navy veteran just trying to make a change for West Virginia.\u201d  The primary election for the senate race will be held on May 8.

Aaron Scheinberg, a U.S. military veteran running for a Second Congressional District Seat as a Democrat, said, \u201cMedicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act has enabled 211,000 who didn\u2019t have access to healthcare at all, get healthcare.\u201d  \u201cI will do everything in my power to prevent [a repeal] from happening,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow 211,000 West Virginians to lose their health insurance. We have to fix the cost associated with the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s where I will start. \u201c  Talley Sergent, also running for the Second Congressional District seat as a Democrat, said, \u201cThat\u2019s why we need leaders in West Virginia that understand Medicaid is a lifeline to the 211,000 West Virginians who now have it.  \u201cThis should not be a partisan issue. Unfortunately, it is. If we keep electing the same individuals we are going to get the same results. I will never vote to cut Medicaid. I will only work to protect it, support it and strengthen it.\u201d  Republican Jack Newbrough is running for a U.S. Senate Seat and said the healthcare issue is where he differs from the Democrats who were seated at the table.  \u201cUnder Obamacare, if you are paying $500 a month and you have a $15,000 deductible, that is not health insurance,\u201d he said.  Newbrough said he does not believe Medicaid would be taken away but also doesn\u2019t believe the government needs a bigger role in healthcare.  \u201cAnytime you get the government involved in health insurance, it\u2019s never going to be good,\u201d he said.  Paula Jean Swearengin, running as a Democrat for U.S. Senate,  said she was an advocate for healthcare for all.  \u201cWe live in the wealthiest country in the world; there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t provide the people with healthcare,\u201d she said.  Swearengin said that even people who have health insurance now can\u2019t afford access to healthcare because of the cost.  From healthcare, the forum moved on to economic development.  Scheinberg said, \u201cWe have to diversify. We have to invest in the fasted growing parts of the national economy. We have to have infrastructure.\u201d  He said 30 percent of West Virginia not having access to high speed internet is a problem.  One idea Scheinberg proposed was having a national park in West Virginia that would bring more tourism.  Sergent said, \u201cI think deploying high speed internet is the lynch pin. She proposed a 21st century new deal that involves work force revitalization, education with technical and community colleges and a jobs plan that goes beyond traditional industries.  Newbrough cited a veterans in agriculture program as an example of trying something new.  On the topic of strengthening education, Swearingen said that Medicare for all would fix the PEIA program. She also said that more money was needed to make sure teachers are paid competitively.  \u201cOur children are not going to have a different path in West Virginia if they can\u2019t stay here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to make sure our schools are funded period.\u201d  Newbrough said he had questions about why the teachers and service personnel had organized the work stoppage.  As he learned more, Newbrough said, \u201cI was amazed at how they were really screwing you guys over, to put it bluntly.\u201d  Sergent commented, \u201cAs a product of West Virginia Public Schools, I think public education is a cornerstone to the economy. She said the big concern she has is when she asks teachers what she can do to help they say, \u2018Let me teach. Get rid of these regulations on our teachers. Let them do what they do on their expertise.\u201d  Scheinberg said, \u201cEvery child across West Virginia and across the country should have the best possible education regardless of their zip code.\u201d  He noted that respect for teachers has diminished and teachers are taking home more work on. He said he stood with teachers during the work stoppage and noted they have inspired the country.  Another issue raised was what the candidates would do to address gun violence in the schools.  Sergent said, \u201cI believe in the Second Amendment but as an aunt to children in West Virginia Public Schools, I am terrified for them. We have to make sure we take special interests out of this.\u201d  Newbrough said he was a concealed carry holder and he disagreed with telling someone who is 18 that they can go off to war but can\u2019t purchase certain firearms.  He also said, \u201cWhy is this the gun\u2019s fault?  Scheinberg said his grandfather came to West Virginia because he loved to hunt and he supported the second amendment but noted that bump stocks should be banned and that there needed to be improved background checks.  Swearengin said, \u201cI fully support the Second Amendment but I firmly believe we need commonsense gun measures. You should have to have a license to have a firearm.\u201d We have to do everything we can to protect our children in schools and we have to make sure guns do not go in the wrong hands.\u201d  Saturday\u2019s form was held at the First Presbyterian Church.

Sanders landed 124,700 votes in West Virginia during the 2016 primary election, or 51.4 percent of the Democratic vote. He won every county in the state.  With a similar platform as Sanders, Swearengin is hoping to garner that same enthusiasm among the state\u2019s Democrats.  \u201cI really admire Bernie Sanders. He actually cares. How many people are going to come from Vermont to McDowell County just to hear what the problems are? A lot of my platform does align with that. He wants to bring progress not only in this state, but this country.\u201d  Swearengin says West Virginia\u2019s main issues are as follows:  \u2022 Opioid epidemic \u2014 She says Big Pharma has influenced politicians for too long. She believes medication-assisted treatment (MAT) has a role to play in addressing the epidemic, and more long-term treatment centers are needed.  \u201cI want to see long-term recovery in every part of West Virginia... We also have to make sure to work on prevention.\u201d  \u2022 Economy and jobs \u2014 She says the Mountain State needs to diversify its economy to survive, with renewable resources and tourism. The gas industry needs to pay its fair share, too.  \u201cI know what it\u2019s like when a family member gets laid off after having a somewhat comfortable life,\u201d Swearengin says. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear difference between being a friend of the coal industry versus being a friend of coal miners.\u201d  She says too many candidates have campaigned on \u201cbringing back coal jobs,\u201d but she says, \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest lie anybody could tell.\u201d  \u2022 Health care \u2014 She believes Medicare should be available for everyone.  \u201cI think we\u2019re behind other countries. We\u2019re not distributing wealth effectively. If you have a healthy, happy workforce, it\u2019s the economic thing to do.\u201d  She says providing Medicare for everyone would help small businesses struggling to pay high premiums for employees.  \u201cWest Virginia is one of the sickest and poorest states in the nation. It would help us greatly with universal health care.\u201d  She also believes fully legalizing cannabis would be beneficial, not only financially and medically, but in terms of the opioid epidemic, too. Studies have shown a decline in opioid addiction in states that have fully legalized marijuana.  \u2022 Environment \u2014 She says she\u2019s tired of seeing the environment polluted by industry, only for West Virginians to be left suffering.  \u201cI worry about my children getting cancer in the southern coalfields,\u201d she says. \u201cYou see a lot of women in West Virginia on the ballot. I think there\u2019s an awakening because of the corruption. As Appalachian women, you don\u2019t mess with our young.\u201d  She would also like to see hemp grown on mountaintop removal sites, to \u201ctransform the barren wastelands\u201d into profit for the state.  \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  Swearengin says for years, politicians have been \u201cfinancially invested in our demise.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s going to take people with a vision for this state \u2014 a vision that isn\u2019t from their funders\u2019 pockets.\u201d  She\u2019s asking West Virginians to make their voices heard May 8 at the ballot.  \u201cI would love to have their vote. This was not my dream. I did not want to go down this path.\u201d  But after seeing years of political corruption and the devastation it\u2019s caused West Virginia, Swearengin says, \u201cI want to be a vessel and a voice for this state.\u201d","articles_date":"7 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.montgomery-herald.com\/news\/who-is-paula-jean-swearengin\/article_07c0858e-5229-11e8-9102-03ef3d3a5b0d.html","articles_title":"Who is Paula Jean Swearengin?","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":6,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":8},{"article_text":"GLEN DALE, W.Va. - Democratic candidate for the United States Senate Paula Jean Swearengin made a campaign stop in the Ohio Valley on Thursday.

She points at trailer homes caked in a fine layer of black soot, blown off the coal trucks that thunder through the area \u2013 \"You see the coal dust on these homes!\" she says \u2013 and stops at a gurgling creek glowing orange. The waste rock of a nearby mountaintop-removal mining site, latent with hazardous elements like selenium, is dumped into valleys, where the toxic chemicals leach into streams. According to a number of studies, the process also increases the rates of lung cancer, kidney disease and birth defects in surrounding communities. \"People are dropping like flies,\" says Swearengin, whose activism has turned into a long-shot bid for the U.S. Senate this year.  Despite America's turn toward natural gas and renewables, 17 percent of U.S. energy still comes from coal, and approximately 12,000 West Virginians work in the industry. Hunks of coal are sold at the airport gift shop in Charleston, and the state's beloved college football team, the West Virginia Mountaineers, touch a piece of coal for good luck before entering their stadium. A popular program called Coal in the Classroom has sent industry representatives into schools to educate \"children about the history and importance of coal.\" \"They've fed us this propaganda that coal miners should be enemies with environmental organizers,\" says Swearengin. \"I am a proud coal miner's daughter, but I'm not going to worship that black rock.\"  It was just more than a year ago that Swearengin, seated on a stage in a high school auditorium in McDowell County, described her state's essential dilemma to Vermont's Sen. Bernie Sanders. \"When the coal industry's gone, we're not going to have anything left,\" she acknowledged, before listing the devastation the industry had caused her personally: \"I've watched my neighbor's children get cancer. I buried my daddy when he was 54 years old. I watched my granddaddy suffocate to death.\" At that point, Swearengin, weeping, reached over to hug Sanders, who consoled her in an embrace. \"We need help,\" she said. It was a central moment, she now says, in her decision to launch a political campaign. \"I see the senator as a public servant,\" she says. \"And I think they've lost touch. They've become immune to people's suffering.\"  \"Coal kills,\" says miner turned activist Chuck Nelson. \"That is what's so criminal about it. Politicians know that and they allow it.\" Her opponent in the May 8th primary, Joe Manchin, West Virginia's sole national-level Democrat, has been in state politics since the time of Reagan, serving as West Virginia's secretary of state and governor. Most recently, in the U.S. Senate, he has taken on the role of the Democrats' token red-state oracle, appearing in national media to decode his state's politics and answer softball questions about Trump country. Although current conventional wisdom holds that the state is red through and through, Manchin remains, according to a poll conducted last summer by West Virginia MetroNews, the state's most popular politician. For Swearengin to confront him, one West Virginia operative recently told Vice, is \"like David versus Goliath, if David didn't have a sling or a rock.\"  Swearengin has tried to tap into a long-simmering populism in West Virginia politics. Much has been made of the fact that Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in every single one of West Virginia's 55 counties, but that doesn't explain another lesson from the 2016 election: Sanders beat Clinton in every single one of West Virginia's 55 counties, too. In February, Lissa Lucas, a backyard chicken farmer and author from Ritchie County, called out legislators on the statehouse floor for letting the oil-and-gas industry write its laws and was dragged away by a pair of security guards \u2013 she is currently running for the state House of Delegates. Weeks later, West Virginia's public-school teachers, who receive among the worst pay in the nation \u2013 about $15,000 less than the national average \u2013 yet must deal with a student population so needy they regularly spend their own money to feed and clothe them, held one of the largest illegal strikes in the history of American education. Teachers walked out of schools in all of West Virginia's 55 counties \u2013 joined by bus drivers, custodians and other public workers \u2013 and rallied for nine days. \"We're not gonna take it!\" the crowd hollered in unison from the lower rotunda at the Capitol in Charleston, imitating the Twisted Sister song.   Paula Jean Swearengin, who faces Sen. Joe Manchin in the Democratic primary, says politicians \"have become immune to people's sufferings.\" This is the segment of the state Swearengin aims to attract with a platform that includes Medicare for all, increased minimum wage, tuition-free state college, legalized marijuana and a major public investment in infrastructure, including alternative energies like wind and solar. \"There is a strong liberal democratic faction that has re-emerged in the state,\" says West Virginia University political historian William Gorby. \"It will be interesting to see what this group does.\"  Manchin, who voted to confirm Trump picks like Jeff Sessions, Neil Gorsuch and Scott Pruitt, and has politely sat down to dinner with the president, is decidedly not a member of the Resistance. A former head of a coal brokerage firm \u2013 a lucrative business interest he maintained even while in the Senate \u2013 Manchin has the backing of the United Mine Workers of America, which represents more than 35,000 current and retired West Virginia miners. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has traveled down to Charleston to speak on Manchin's behalf. He has more than $5 million to spend on the election, having received more than $700,000 from the mining industry since 2009; Swearengin, with an average donation of $15, has raised around $300,000. (Manchin's campaign did not return requests for comment.)  Since declaring her candidacy, Swearengin has relied on little more than social media and a pithy campaign-trail message \u2013 \"We've provided power to America, and now it's time to empower ourselves\" \u2013 to become a star on Twitter, posting frank accounts of her state's tragedies and linking them to Manchin's policies. \"She is a powerhouse,\" says filmmaker Rachel Lears, who is working on a documentary that features Swearengin and three other female candidates. \"Running for Senate is a matter of survival for her.\"  Pretty much the first thing Swearengin tells me is that it's not just a matter of survival for her, but for her entire struggling state. \"The people here are treated like collateral damage,\" she tells me on our drive, somewhere between the coal-dusted homes and selenium-laden creek. West Virginians still \"live in conditions comparable to a Third World country,\" she says. \"And what does that say about America?\"   Two days later, Swearengin introduces me to Chuck Nelson, a retired coal miner she met at a festival to protest mountaintop-removal mining around 2012. Nelson loaded coal in underground mines for nearly 30 years, seven of which were spent employed by Massey Energy, a coal company owned by Don Blankenship. \"The outlaw mining regime,\" as Nelson calls Massey, ripped out safety equipment, including ventilation systems, to boost the pace of production. Nelson has had liver failure and kidney disease, and now has black lung, which occurs as coal dust particles accumulate in the respiratory system. Blankenship, who recently finished a yearlong prison sentence related to a 2010 explosion in one of his mines that killed 29 people, is now running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican.  In the 1990s, mountaintop-removal mining operations were set up on the ridgeline outside Sylvester, the small mining town where Nelson lived most of his life. His wife's asthma worsened. Neighbors died of seemingly rare cancers. The wind blew coal dust from a nearby plant and deposited it in Nelson's home. \"There was coal dust in the refrigerator,\" he says. \"That's how fucking bad it was.\" Now, at 62, he serves as a guide for the next generation of activists. \"Coal kills at each step of the cycle \u2013 the mining, the cleaning, the transportation,\" says Nelson. \"That is what's so criminal about it. Our politicians know that, and they allow it to happen.\"  A coal-preparation plant run by a subsidiary of Massey Energy used to be located a few hundred feet from the nearby Marsh Fork Elementary School. Students found coal dust on their desks, their lockers and wafting through the cafeteria, says Debbie Jarrell, co-director of Coal River Mountain Watch, who for years battled the state to relocate the school. A coal-slurry -impoundment \u2013 which holds 2.8 billion gallons of a sludgelike residual of the coal-preparation process \u2013 sits just up the hill. Family members were so worried about the impoundment breaking over the heads of their children, they often kept kids home when it rained.  Protests erupted during the summer of 2005, as parents and organizers demanded action by the state. Manchin, then the governor, refused to acknowledge the health hazards. An \"extensive investigation revealed no evidence of health risks or regulatory noncompliance,\" read a letter from his office. \"Manchin didn't see the water fountains getting covered with coal dust,\" says Nelson. \"He didn't see the kids getting sick, he didn't see the teachers dying of cancer. He just ignored all that shit!\" (In 2013, a new school opened a few miles away.)   A mountaintio-removal site. Rick Eglinton\/Getty Swearengin and I jump on ATVs to see the Brushy Fork coal-slurry impoundment, the largest in America, holding back roughly 9 billion gallons of toxic waste behind a dam that at over 900 feet is the tallest in the U.S. \u2013 and like the rest of West Virginia's 100-plus coal-slurry impoundments, made of mining waste rock. In 1972, a failure at the nearby Buffalo Creek impoundment sent a 30-foot-high tidal wave of viscous coal slurry through a series of communities, wiping out hundreds of homes and killing 125 people. Jack Spadaro, the former director of the National Mine Health and Safety Academy, who was called into the Buffalo Creek breach as a 23-year-old engineer, tells me Brushy Fork's dam is similarly experiencing \"excessive pore pressure\" that could cause it to fail. The impoundment, he adds, rests atop unstable underground mines. \"It makes me mad,\" says Swearengin. \"This is sitting over people's heads. Just another disaster waiting to happen.\"  Across Appalachia, surface mining has demolished more than 500 mountains \u2013 some 2 million acres of forested hills \u2013 and contaminated 2,000 miles of streams. \"If another country came in here and blew up our mountains and poisoned our water, we'd go to war,\" says Swearengin after our ATV ride brings us to a denuded ridgeline that overlooks the scummy black lake. \"But a company can do it.\"  A few days earlier on Kayford Mountain, an intact peak sandwiched between two massive operations, Swearengin offered an alternative vision for West Virginia's mountaintops. We had ascended to a bluff that looks down into the bowl of the decapitated mountain. Inside, a gray-green plain was strewn with shattered rocks; truck treads were still visible along the paths used by the industry to haul the coal and waste rock. \"This isn't fit for a rattlesnake,\" Swearengin had said. \"But visualize this being a hemp farm, or windmills, or solar farms, something! Instead of just being a desolate moonscape that's left and forgotten.\"  \"If another country came in here and blew up our mountains and poisoned our water, we'd go to war,\" says Swearengin. \"But a company can do it.\"   It may sound starry-eyed, but the state Legislature has already started moving on some of these initiatives. Last year, West Virginia passed a bill allowing licensed residents to grow industrial hemp for commercial purposes, and the state Legislature is in the process of creating an in-state seed-certification program. (In April, bipartisan legislation to facilitate hemp farming was introduced by Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell.) In northern West Virginia, former state Sen. Mike Manypenny showed me around an 11-acre plot of old greenhouses that he is currently retrofitting for hemp production, a crop he aims to sell for its CBD oil, a booming tincture in the health-and-wellness -market. \"I think hemp is going to be the next cash crop of West Virginia,\" says Vinnie Samolis, who is presently working to model a program that could be used on small plots by landowners across the region. \"It would be great for people to have a choice: You can go work in the coal mines or grow hemp.\"  For now, West Virginia remains perilously tied to fossil fuels. The state lost 17,000 jobs between 2012 and 2016, with a significant portion of them related to a downturn in the coal industry, according to a report published by West Virginia University. While the number of jobs in the nation has jumped 83 percent since 1975, the number of jobs in Appalachia has increased by only 50 percent. A 2015 study by the Social Science Research Council reported that in certain Appalachian counties, like McDowell in West Virginia or Martin in Kentucky (a coal county where fetid tap water has recently made national news), over 40 percent of youths ages 16 to 24 are \"disconnected\" \u2013 neither employed nor enrolled in school. \"Some parts of the country,\" the report states, \"are being left behind.\"  At Opportunity House, a drug-treatment center in Buckhannon where Swearengin has occasionally volunteered her time, director Matt Kerner, a former addict himself who is running for the state House of Delegates, introduces me to a roomful of people whom, he says, the state has intentionally neglected: \"Just another example of how around the world, places rich with natural resources end up people-poor. Corporations come in and extract whatever it is they want, and what we're left with is some double-wide trailers and old trucks, which leads to despair and addiction.\"   One snowy afternoon, Swearengin, along with several other West Virginia progressive candidates, makes a campaign stop in the basement of the New Beginning Apostolic Church in Minden, a small town of 250 people in southern West Virginia. Until the early 1980s, the nearby Shaffer Equipment Co., which built electrical substations for the coal-mining industry, used polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in much of its equipment. Banned by the EPA in 1979, PCBs are known to ravage the human body's nervous, immune and reproductive systems, and are especially hazardous to children. In the Minden area, the chemicals often leaked, or were outright dumped, into the creek running through town, burned in open fires, and illegally buried at a number of sites. There's an unmarked dump on the edge of the community filled with PCB-laced transformers and coal sludge \u2013 along with illegal radioactive waste from a nearby hospital. According to Brandon Richardson, the founder of Headwaters Defense, as many as 150 people connected to the community \u2013 more than half the town's population \u2013 have been diagnosed with cancer in the past four years.  The goal of the event is to get Gov. Jim Justice to push forward a recommendation to the EPA that Minden be designated a Superfund Site, which could provide funding to enable residents to be relocated. (Weeks later, Justice released a statement vowing to take action.) \"I can stand on my porch and name 40 people who've died of cancer,\" says Annetta Coffman, a Minden resident who explains that the toxicity of the area is so bad the EPA has asked residents \"not to grow gardens.\" Amy Garrison Ebans, a young mother, recently became sick with breast cancer. \"I was a water bug,\" she says, describing how she swam in the Minden creek as a child, even though her mother had warned her about pollution. \"You don't listen because you're a kid. Now you pay for it.\"  Swearengin has had to develop her own art of political campaigning. \"Early on, I went to a lot of these establishment dinners, rubbing noses with the elite, and I wished I wouldn't have wasted as much time trying to reach people who have probably already made up their minds,\" she says. But in a church room filled with the survivors of an industrial disaster, she seems at home. \"If you don't know, I'm Paula Jean Swearengin, and I'm running for Senate against Joe Manchin,\" she announces. \"And one of the reasons I am is because of struggles like this.\"   Sen. Joe Manchin is trying to remain West Virginia's sole national Democrat in November. Bill Clark\/Roll Call Swearengin grew up in the southern West Virginia coal-mining town of Iroquois, where a dump of coal waste and other hazardous byproducts smoldered in the surrounding hills, sending plumes of toxic smoke, containing sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide, down on her community. \"It burned 24 hours a day,\" she says. She lived in an old coal-company house, with wood siding and a big porch. \"There were a lot of birth defects there,\" she says \u2013 her younger sister was born with a cyst on the base of her brain. Her grandfather, who had worked for decades in an underground coal mine, was diagnosed with black lung, and died in 2001.  Around that time, she and her family settled in Lester, another small mining town, where coal slurry was being injected beneath the community. Her children developed asthma. A disproportionate number of her neighbors had cancer. \"Around my block, I could count eight people,\" says Swearengin. One neighbor's daughter, a 12-year-old girl named Destiny, had a rare form of bone cancer. In calling local officials to see what was behind this unlikely cluster, Swearengin discovered that a little girl in a neighboring town had contracted the same type of cancer. That, she says, \"is when I became active.\"  Between various jobs \u2013 manager of a urologist's office, assistant at a medical-billing company \u2013 she attended rallies against mountaintop-removal mining. At a Kayford Mountain demonstration, she met a charismatic activist named Larry Gibson. \"Larry made me feel like I was a part of something,\" says Swearengin. Just four months before he died of a heart attack in 2012, he shaved Swearengin's head at a protest on the steps of the state Capitol. \"I cried,\" she says. \"I didn't want to give up my hair, but I felt I had to do something radical to get attention.\"  Whether that radical energy can fuel electoral wins in West Virginia is the unanswered question. Progressives in the state Legislature, says Gorby, the political historian, \"are debating issues like the legalization of marijuana, raising the state's minimum wage and stopping the cuts to higher education.\" He also points out that in 2010, activist and former Rep. Ken Hechler, then 95 years old, ran a primary campaign against Manchin to fill the Senate seat vacated by the late Robert Byrd. \"I'm not really running for the Senate,\" Hechler, who died in 2016, told Salon. \"I'm running to enable the people of West Virginia to register at the polls their opposition to [the] devastating practice\" of mountaintop removal. He still managed to pull out 17 percent of the vote.  \"People think we're a bunch of hillbillies,\" says former state Sen. Charlotte Pritt, a longtime advocate for the environment, women's rights and worker safety who beat Manchin in the Democratic primary of the 1996 gubernatorial race. Pointing to the wave of populism that marked the state's 2016 electorate, she says, \"West Virginians were smarter than the rest of the country; they knew what was up in the last election.\" But the general feeling among the state's political observers is that, despite the present progressive energy, Swearengin faces steep odds. \"Politically speaking, this is an extreme long shot,\" popular West Virginia radio host Hoppy Kercheval tells me in January. \"I don't see this mobilized progressive grassroots movement rising up to propel her to upend the giant Joe Manchin.\"  And yet, weeks later, West Virginia teachers from the state's 55 counties stormed the Capitol. Similar strikes broke out in Oklahoma and Kentucky, two other states with economies that rely heavily on fossil fuels, as well as Colorado and Arizona. Katrina Ruff, a teacher in Oklahoma, told The New York Times in April that West Virginians \"gave us the guts to stand up for ourselves.\" At the New Beginning Apostolic Church in Minden, Swearengin's voice is filled with emotion. \"I don't think we should have to sacrifice ourselves for our jobs,\" she says. Her audience is nodding and listening. \"I think we need to unite, to raise the voices of West Virginia. No one should be living like you all are.\"  Afterward, Tim Comer, a 42-year-old mechanic on disability because of ailments he believes could be connected to the contamination, tells me, \"The lady right there seems to be real.\" His father died of lymphoma, and his sister developed cancer as a teenager. \"It seems like she has a heart and cares for the little people, like she is fighting for people like me,\" says Comer. \"She can represent me, she can count on my vote.\"    Blankenship, the coal magnate who spent a year in prison after the death of 29 workers at one of his mines, is competing for the Republican nomination in the primary for U.S. Senate in West Virginia. Spencer Platt\/Getty Recent republican polling shows Blankenship is still competitive in a matchup that also includes Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. A March poll by Axios\/SurveyMonkey showed that an unnamed Republican candidate beats Manchin 52 percent to 43 percent. Republican attack ads have targeted Manchin for, among other things, his superdelegate vote for Clinton. If Manchin beats Swearengin, he will likely face the toughest general election of his career. \"If Manchin loses, he will lose on his record,\" says Selina Vickers, a social worker and former Sanders delegate running for the West Virginia House of Delegates. \"He will lose because of his decision to turn his back on the West Virginia people.\" Charlotte Pritt is firmer: \"Don Blankenship will win the Republican nomination, and unless Paula Jean Swearengin is running, he will win\" the Senate seat.  On the way back to the Charleston area, Swearengin shows me a pipe that drains antimony and arsenic out of an abandoned underground coal mine and into a pond beside the road. \"There are sites like this all over West Virginia,\" she says. \"Nobody knows how many because they haven't been mapped.\" The smell is horrendous. Waste from the pond pours into a creek that enters the Coal River, which many of the communities we have visited rely on for well water. \"Everyone knows it's wrong, but they don't know how to fight back,\" says Swearengin. \"We call it Appalachian Stockholm Syndrome: It feels like we are hostages and there's nothing we can do.\"","articles_date":"30 8 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/politics\/news\/revolt-in-west-virginias-coal-country-w519647","articles_title":"Revolt in West Virginia's Coal Country","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":6,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":8},{"article_text":"President Donald Trump won West Virginia by 42 percentage points in 2016. He\u2019s holding on to high approval ratings in the state and conservatives paint Democrat incumbent U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin as vulnerable. Long known as a moderate Democrat, Manchin has been in West Virginia politics for three decades. With the seat up for grabs this year, the national spotlight has been on the GOP primary -- in which hopefuls are trying to align themselves with Trump.  But this year, the Democratic stalwart in West Virginia politics faces his own primary challenger in progressive Paula Jean Swearengin -- an activist-turned-candidate who says Manchin hasn\u2019t done enough to retain the party nomination.  When the president visited White Sulphur Springs in early April, the stop was billed as a roundtable discussion highlighting the effects of recently passed tax-reform legislation. With GOP Senate hopefuls Evan Jenkins and Patrick Morrisey flanking Trump, the event veered toward attacks on Manchin and his no vote on the tax bill.  \u201cThe Democrats have a problem. I mean, look at your senator. He voted against. Joe -- he voted against. It was bad. I thought he would be helpful,\u201d Trump said at the event.  Overall, though, Manchin has voted with the Trump administration more than 61 percent of the time -- including legislation and nominations, according to Senate records. He says he votes based on the issues themselves and what\u2019s best for West Virginia.  \u201cI say to the people of West Virginia you've hired me. I work for you. I do not work for the president but I want to work with him and I try every day and I will try,\u201d Manchin said in a recent meeting with the media.  That record puts him at odds with the national Democratic Party. Manchin has voted against a majority of Senate Democrats 29.3 percent of the time in the 115th Congress, according to Propublica\u2019s Represent, a web app that tallies congressional voting records. He ranks first among all senators in voting against his party -- with the average Senate Democrat breaking against the majority of the party\u2019s vote 10.1 percent of the time.  He landed in Washington after winning a special election following the death of Robert C. Byrd in 2010. Since then, Manchin has touted himself as willing to work across party lines to compromise.  \u201cI don't look at Republicans as my enemy, I look at them as my friends and my colleagues -- and we're all in this together. You've got to be able to find a pathway for it,\" Manchin said. \"For people to take a hard line on one side or the other -- whether it\u2019s the hard right or the hard left  -- you cannot get anything accomplished.\u201d  But it\u2019s those attempts to reach across the aisle and frequent voting with the Republican majority that is in large part what drew Manchin\u2019s primary challenger into the race.  \u201cHe calls himself a West Virginia Democrat, but I'm not sure if he knows what that means,\u201d said Paula Jean Swearengin, a native of Mullens, West Virginia who identifies as a coal miner\u2019s daughter and coal miner\u2019s granddaughter.  \u201cThe reason to take him on is because he's not adhering to the platform of the Democratic Party and he's not serving the working class,\u201d she said.  After asking Manchin in person for help with the economy in southern West Virginia and to tackle environmental issues like water quality, Swearengin says she felt unheard and overlooked.  She took her pleas to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders when the Vermont politician made a stop last spring in McDowell County for a taping of a town hall on MSNBC\u2019s \u2018All In with Chris Hayes.\u2019  \u201cThe reason that I went to go see Bernie Sanders is because I was begging him for hope. I mean, I've begged for this state for years and I admired him because he was the only senator to sit down with me and talk to me like I was a human being,\u201d Swearengin said.  Swearengin is backed by Brand New Congress, a political action committee established by former staffers and supporters of Sanders\u2019 campaign for president in 2016. The group is aiming to run progressive, working-class candidates around the country in hopes of combatting a political environment they say is dominated by big money.  \u201c[The intent] of this nation was to have a diverse set of people in any and all walk of governments. It wasn't designed to have paid-for, polished politicians to represent us. This nation was built by the people for the people and of the people,\u201d she said.   Many say Swearengin faces an uphill battle to beat Manchin for the Democratic nomination. Beyond name recognition, Manchin\u2019s fundraising efforts have outmatched Swearengin\u2019s by more than 30 to 1. She\u2019s raised nearly $200,000 to Manchin\u2019s $6 million.  Swearengin remains undeterred. Despite identifying as a coal miner\u2019s daughter, she\u2019s hoping to take on the industry that she says has wreaked havoc on where she grew up and still lives.  \u201cThere's no reason as a coal miner's daughter that I should have to beg for something so basic as a clean glass of water. At the same time, we see coal miners that want to just feed their families. And we've heard that propaganda tree hugger versus coal miner. It's even been labeled environmentalist before and that's not it,\u201d Swearengin explained.  \u201cWe we want it all. There's no reason that we can't have basic human rights and, like I said,  we don't even have adequate sewage systems,\u201d she added.  After teachers across West Virginia went on a nine-day strike calling for better pay and benefits, many observers of state politics have wondered if the labor movement -- one that caught fire in other deeply red states -- can translate to a wave of wins for progressives.  But as May 8 nears, Manchin\u2019s campaign is focused more so on November and his potential challenger in the midterm election.  \u201cMy approach is this: I don't pick my opponents. They picked to run and choose to run against me. And whoever that may be, we'll put our records up hopefully and try to get the facts out -- as hard as it is in today's toxic atmosphere,\u201d Manchin said.  Unlike the race for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, state Democrats did not arrange debates between Manchin and Swearengin. West Virginia Democratic Party chairwoman Belinda Biafore said no media outlet ever contacted the organization to organize a statewide debate.","articles_date":"3 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/wvpublic.org\/post\/outmatched-experience-and-funds-swearengin-remains-undeterred-primary-against-manchin#stream\/0","articles_title":"Outmatched in Experience and Funds, Swearengin Remains Undeterred in Primary Against Manchin","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":6,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":8},{"article_text":"Coal baron Don Blankenship, tarred by a mining accident that killed 29 people, is one of the three leading Republican contenders in the West Virginia Senate race \u2014 which is quickly becoming one of the most-watched campaigns of 2018. Washington Republicans are doing their best to stop him and Blankenship is fighting back in a campaign increasingly filled with nasty and personal insults.  Meanwhile, Democratic groups actually appear to be propping up Blankenship by targeting his competitors with a TV ad barrage leading up to the May 8 primary.  Come November, West Virginia will be a top Republican target. It\u2019s become something of a miracle the state still has a statewide Democrat at all, though Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has a long history within the state. But he\u2019s in choppy waters. While it has a working-class Democratic history, West Virginia went for Donald Trump by 42 points and hasn\u2019t gone for a Democrat in the presidential election since 1996.  \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong anti-establishment sentiment in West Virginia, and there\u2019s also an \u2018it can\u2019t get any worse\u2019 sentiment,\u201d Patrick Hickey, a political science professor at West Virginia University, told me. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to shake it up.\u201d  Blankenship is the GOP primary\u2019s wild card. The former Massey Energy CEO has an extensive personal fortune and deep West Virginia ties in the state\u2019s marquee industry. Then again, he also has a criminal conviction, and many voters in the state will never forgive him for the Upper Big Branch mining accident.  The coal boss shook up what had been a two-man Republican primary: Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey have also thrown their hat in the ring.  \u201cOne candidate has no convictions, one candidate has a conviction, and the other guy is a carpetbagger,\u201d Jeff Kessler, a Democratic politician in the state, told me.  The Hill reported that an outside group with links to Washington Republicans is spending $200,000 on TV ads to try to stop Blankenship. But the coal baron is firing back with a bizarrely personal campaign against Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, dragging his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, into the race with odd allegations of Chinese influence \u2014 complete with the use of the word \u201cChinaperson\u201d \u2014 while dubbing the Senate majority leader \u201cCocaine Mitch\u201d in a strange new ad.  Thins have only escalated from there. Blankenship released another ad attacking McConnell\u2019s \u201cChina family\u201d \u2014 while saying he wasn\u2019t being racist because \u201craces are negro, white caucasian, Hispanic, Asian.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump has finally weighed in, urging voters in the state to reject Blankenship and back either of the other two Republican candidates.  At the same time, national Democrats are pouring in their own money to try to bring down Morrisey and Jenkins. Politico reported that the Democratic-allied group Duty and Country was spending nearly $400,000 to savage Jenkins and Morrisey \u2014 but sparing Blankenship. It sure looked like they were elevating the GOP candidate with the biggest vulnerability against Manchin, though they said it was because they believed the other candidates were more likely to be the nominee.  Democrats and Republicans at war ... in a chaotic three person GOP primary campaign. Buckle up.  Don Blankenship and his criminal conviction, explained Blankenship is, in many ways, an only-in-West-Virginia story. He grew up in Mingo County and got his college degree from Marshall University. He rose through the ranks at the Massey coal company, helping build it into one of the largest mining outfits in the country. By 2010, he was making nearly $20 million a year.  But then on April 5, 2010, 29 miners died in an explosion at Massey\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine in southern West Virginia.  Blankenship stepped down soon after, but four years later, federal prosecutors indicted him on conspiring to willfully violate federal mining regulations before the accident and making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission in its aftermath.  The investigation laid bare Blankenship\u2019s cutthroat vision of capitalism. This was a businessman who broke unions, laughed off climate change, despised federal regulations, and described his industry in Darwinian imagery. As I wrote for Talking Points Memo in 2014:  In another handwritten note to the same executive, he called employment of workers tasked with maintaining safety \u201cliterally crazy\u201d and \u201cridiculous,\u201d according to the indictment. The pressure to bring in as much coal as possible at the lowest possible cost was intense.  \u201cIn my opinion, children could run these mines better than you all do,\u201d Blankenship said in another memo. \u201cLook at your cost and figure out what you are going to do to get it down because if we don\u2019t have a better August and September than we had July, you can be assured that the stock options are not going to look very attractive.\u201d  \u201cPlease be reminded that your core job is to make money,\u201d he wrote in yet another memo before the accident, while adding that: \u201cI\u2019m looking to make an example out of somebody and I don\u2019t mean embarrassment.\u201d  Blankenship was eventually convicted of conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards. He always maintained his innocence, even calling himself a political prisoner. But he still served one year behind bars, becoming a free man in May 2017.  And he has a not-insignificant chance of securing the Republican nomination for Senate in West Virginia in two weeks.  The West Virginia Republican Senate primary is a total mess To rehabilitate his image, the Blankenship campaign has been running ads to convince West Virginians that his trial was a politically motivated attack by President Barack Obama.   Blankenship\u2019s entry into the race upended what otherwise might have been a pretty generic contest between Jenkins and Morrisey: the mainstream GOP favorite and the candidate positioning himself as an outsider, respectively.  \u201cHe has deeper ties to the state than Jenkins or Morrisey do,\u201d Hickey said of Blankenship. \u201cHe can say: \u2018I was a Republican in West Virginia before it was cool to be a Republican in West Virginia.\u2019 It\u2019s that authenticity. He has guts. He\u2019s real.\u201d  Blankenship has sought to slime Jenkins, who has represented the southern half of the state in the House since 2015, as an ex-Democrat; Jenkins did indeed switch parties in 2013, though his supporters would remind you that is not an unfamiliar journey in a state like West Virginia.  The coal baron is hitting Morrisey, state attorney general since 2013, for a history of lobbying for drugmakers in a state with the worst opioid crisis in the country, though Morrisey has sued to make data on opioid sales more available while serving as attorney general.  Republicans in Washington, DC, have been worried about Blankenship for a while. The New York Times reported in February that McConnell did not want the former coal boss to be the party\u2019s nominee in the race against Manchin. A new PAC, Mountain Families, with ties to establishment Republicans has attacked Blankenship on the state\u2019s airwaves.  \u201cWho will clean up Washington? Not convicted criminal Don Blankenship,\u201d narration for one of the group\u2019s ads begins.   Blankenship is directing plenty of fire back at McConnell, saying he does not back the long-time Republican leader and dubbing him the \u201cswamp captain.\u201d Then in a radio interview, he called the father of McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine Chao, \u201ca wealthy Chinaperson\u201d and insinuated that the Republican leader was therefore \u201csoft on China.\u201d  In his latest escalation, Blankenship ended an otherwise-normal ad by saying he wanted to \u201cditch Cocaine Mitch,\u201d which Politico noted was an apparent reference to \u201ca 2014 report in the liberal Nation magazine that drugs were once found aboard a shipping vessel\u201d owned by the Chao family.   In an apparent countermove to DC Republicans, national Democrats are backing a group running ads hitting Jenkins for his past entanglements with overcharging health insurers and mocking Morrisey as a carpetbagger.   There hasn\u2019t been a lot of good polling on the race. A February poll commissioned by Jenkins\u2019s campaign showed him on top with 33 percent of the vote; Morrisey was at 25 percent, and Blankenship notched 18 percent of the GOP primary electorate\u2019s support. Then the Hill reported earlier this month that Blankenship was placing either first or second in internal polls of the race.  Most recently, after several weeks in which Blankenship and his attacks on McConnell dominated media coverage, the Weekly Standard reported that two internal polls from the West Virginia campaigns found Blankenship with a slight lead over Jenkins and Morrisey.  Within the state, however, Democrats downplay differences between the Republican candidates. With the GOP\u2019s attacks on health care, a successful teachers strike, and coal likely to dominate the debate during the general election, they don\u2019t see much daylight.  \u201cThey\u2019re all in the same bucket,\u201d a West Virginia Democrat who supports Manchin told me. \u201cThey all want to destroy health care for West Virginians, they\u2019re all against teachers when they\u2019re striking, they\u2019re all against coal miner safety.\u201d  Can Joe Manchin hold on to West Virginia for Senate Democrats? To win back the Senate in November, Democrats need to hold on to 10 Senate seats in states that Trump won. Going by the numbers, none is more challenging than West Virginia.  But Manchin has been elected statewide four times, as secretary of state, governor, and then US senator. His allies will point out that Manchin won reelection with 60 percent of the vote in 2012, the same year that Barack Obama got just 35 percent.  For now, Manchin is treading water with West Virginia voters: Morning Consult pegged him in April with 43 percent approval and 44 percent disapproval. Then again, the Wall Street Journal reported in March that a Republican poll found among GOP primary voters, Manchin was sitting pretty with 60 percent approval.  \u201cManchin is no stranger to running well above the party label here,\u201d the West Virginia Democrat told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing for him to be his own brand, and the brand is still strong.\u201d  Then again, some Democrats in the state think that could be his undoing. Manchin endorsed then-Democrat Jim Justice in the 2016 governor\u2019s race \u2014 and then Justice switched parties after sworn in and became a Republican. In the eyes of some skeptical Democrats, it epitomizes the senator\u2019s problems.  Kessler, who ran for governor in 2016 against Justice, said to watch whether Manchin\u2019s primary opponent, Medicare-for-all-endorsing insurgent Paula Jean Swearengin, registers at all on the Democratic side. Not that she should be expected to win, but if Swearengin has a strong showing, Manchin\u2019s brand of centrism could be in trouble, Kessler argued.  \u201cJoe is gonna have the race of his life, truthfully. Liberal and progressive wings of the party are not enchanted with him,\u201d he said.  Manchin supporters roll their eyes, noting that labor unions like the state AFL-CIO are backing the senator and waving away the idea that Justice\u2019s turncoat act could play a role in the Senate race.  \u201cHe pulled a fast one on everybody. That\u2019s more the perception on the ground. It\u2019s not a Manchin thing; it\u2019s more of a Justice issue,\u201d the Manchin-backing Democrat said, though Hickey told me that some Bernie Sanders supporters in West Virginia have not forgotten that Manchin supported Justice.  One wild card that could work in Manchin\u2019s favor, as even Kessler acknowledges, is the teachers strike that took place in West Virginia this year. The state teachers walked out to demand a pay raise and better health care benefits from the GOP-led state government. Manchin appeared with them on the steps of the state capitol.  It was an unprecedented moment of political activism in the state. It seems at least possible that that energy will translate to anti-Republican votes in the fall.  \u201cThat will be an interesting thing to see,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cThe teachers are extremely annoyed with the Republicans.\u201d  But Manchin will still be fighting against that anti-government sentiment that seems so pervasive in West Virginia these days \u2014 and against Trump, who has put a target on the senator and remains overwhelmingly popular in the state.  \u201cI think Manchin\u2019s in a really tough spot too,\u201d Hickey said. \u201cHe\u2019s a career politician. He\u2019s been around here forever.\u201d  Whatever else, this race will not be boring.","articles_date":"8 5 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/policy-and-politics\/2018\/4\/24\/17261876\/don-blankenship-2018-west-virginia-senate-race-joe-manchin-evan-jenkins-patrick-morrisey","articles_title":"Don Blankenship\u2019s surge in the West Virginia Senate race, explained","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":6,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":8},{"article_text":"Last week, Morning Consult, a research company that conducts online polling, released its 2018 rankings for the most and least popular U.S. Senators. Unfortunately for Senator Joe Manchin, he was the big headline.  \u201cManchin (D-W.Va.) is underwater after posting a 17 point slide\u2014the largest drop of any Senator,\u201d read the headline.  Morning Consult says Manchin\u2019s disapproval rating has skyrocketed from a manageable 27 percent last year to 44 percent in the first quarter, that\u2019s one point below his approval rating of 43 percent in his home state.  Those numbers, if they are accurate, are deeply troubling for Manchin, who is seeking re-election this year.  He\u2019s already in a tough environment as the lone Democrat of the delegation from a state that has rapidly shifted from dark blue to deep red.  But it\u2019s not just that. Manchin is taking a hit\u2026 make that multiple hits.  He has been treated like an oversized political pi\u00f1ata over the last several months.  First, he is a long-time politician running at a time when Washington experience is a negative for many voters. Donald Trump rode the \u201cdrain-the-swamp\u201d mantra to a whopping 69 percent of the vote here in 2016 and many of those voters want to keep the drain pipes open through 2018.  Second, his rival Don Blankenship, who is running for the Republican nomination to Manchin\u2019s seat, started ads against Manchin months ago. \u201cJoe Manchin is a Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama supporter,\u201d says the announcer in one TV commercial.  Clinton lost by 15 points to Bernie Sanders in the West Virginia Primary Election in 2016 and by 42 points to Trump in the general.  Obama was wildly unpopular in West Virginia. He lost by 27 points to Mitt Romney in 2012 and by 13 points to John McCain in 2008.  Third, Blankenship is not alone.  The National Republican Senatorial Committee has also been up on radio for several months attacking Manchin, and a Republican super PAC has run TV ads ripping Manchin for voting against the tax plan.  Fourth, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have specifically targeted Manchin several times.  Pence ripped into Manchin during an appearance at the Greenbrier and continued the attack on Twitter for, among other things, not supporting the tax reform bill.  Trump has also gone after Manchin several times, most recently during a stop in White Sulfur Springs.  Earlier in an interview with the New York Times, Trump said, \u201cI like Joe.  You know, it\u2019s like he\u2019s the great centrist, but he\u2019s really not a centrist and I think the people of West Virginia will see that.\u201d  The national rating agencies all view the Senate race as even or tight.  The Cook Political Report ak nd Inside Elections both have it as a toss-up, while Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball has it leaning Democrat (Manchin does have a primary opponent in Paula Jean Swearengin).  Manchin\u2019s people acknowledge the impact of the attack ads of recent months, but they question whether his disapproval numbers could shoot up 17 points. One observer pointed out that Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) saw his approval rating increase by 17 points.  There is always debate about the legitimacy of poll numbers, but collectively the surveys and the anecdotal evidence reinforce the fact that Manchin is in the race of his political life.","articles_date":"16 4 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/wvmetronews.com\/2018\/04\/16\/survey-shows-increasing-challenge-to-manchins-re-election\/","articles_title":"Survey shows increasing challenge to Manchin\u2019s re-election","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":6,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":8},{"article_text":"HUNTINGTON -  Democrat incumbent U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin is seeking a second full six-year term in the U.S. Senate against Paula Jean Swearengin in the May 8 Democratic primary in West Virginia.  Manchin, a former governor, first took office after a 2010 special election following the death of U.S. Sen. Robert C. Byrd.  Swearengin says she is a coal miner's daughter and claims she is the only candidate for U.S. Senate in West Virginia who is not a member of the political elite.  They are the only two candidates for the post in the May 8 Democratic primary election, with the winner facing off against the Republican nominee in the November general election.  Here is a look at the two candidates and their views:  Joe Manchin  Manchin, 70, says he is running to create good-paying jobs that allow West Virginians the opportunity to support their families and save for a secure retirement.  \"I want to continue to bring Republicans and Democrats together to find common-sense solutions in the U.S. Senate,\" he said. \"I fought to secure health care benefits for coal miners, and I want to continue fighting to keep the promise of the pensions our miners have earned. I'm running again to protect seniors from Republican cuts to Medicare and Social Security, promote jobs and skills training centers, invest in infrastructure, keep the commitments we've made to our veterans, seniors and children, grow new industries and fight the epidemic of drug addiction.\"  Manchin said he is the only one who can bring both sides together to get something done.  \"You can't build America up if you are too busy tearing each other down,\" he said. \"I listen to West Virginians, and I always do what's best for our state. I've said that Washington sucks, but I'll never give up fighting for West Virginia. For me, it's not about fighting against the other party; it's about fighting for the people I represent.\"  Manchin says the Affordable Care Act needs to be fixed and not totally destroyed.  \"The Republicans have caused premiums to skyrocket and would throw working families to the wolves. I want to put a stop to that,\" he said. \"I stood by our educators, school service personnel and all of the children that deserve a great education in the state.\"  Manchin said he wants to continue to create good-paying jobs.  \"We need new career opportunities that give our people the chance to pay their bills, have decent, affordable health care and a secure retirement,\" he said. \"I'll make sure our seniors don't have to worry about cuts to Medicare or Social Security, and I won't let big corporations walk away from their pension commitments to workers. I'm working to create jobs and skills training centers, make investments in infrastructure and incentives for businesses to hire veterans.\"  Manchin said rural broadband connectivity is possible.  \"I will continue to pass laws to get that accomplished to support jobs,\" he said. \"Broadband is necessary, and the federal government needs to help build this critical infrastructure. It's essential that businesses, entrepreneurs and students are connected to the world and have the tools they need to compete around the globe.\"  Manchin said West Virginia must end the epidemic of drug addiction and keep the workforce drug-free.  \"I will also continue to fight the federal government's overreaching and redundant rules that hamper businesses' ability to succeed,\" he said. \"I want all of our children to get access to a high-quality education. I want our students to have job opportunities when they graduate and the skills to be competitive in the job market.\"  Paula Jean Swearengin  Swearengin, 43, says she is running on a platform of single-payer health care, a $15 minimum wage, free public college tuition and an end to fracking and mountaintop removal mining.  \"I have experienced the best and the worst from being raised as a child of the coalfields,\" she said. \"I understand that coal has been central to my family's income and to the West Virginia economy for most of the last 155 years. The importance of those coal jobs cannot be understated.\"  Swearengin said she has witnessed firsthand the booms and busts of the coal economy.  \"My family was forced to move to North Carolina during one of those busts,\" she said. \"That was the first time in my life that I experienced hunger and homelessness. I have also watched my family, friends and community suffer from the environmental devastation left behind by greedy or unscrupulous coal bosses who use our people, take their profits and leave their coal waste behind.\"  Swearengin said she decided to stand up for the people and became an environmental advocate.  \"I soon learned that the issues run deeper than just the environment and are really about the larger issue of basic humanity,\" she said. \"West Virginians are proud, hardworking people that have given our blood, sweat and tears to power a nation. Yet, despite the riches underneath our feet, we continue to be among the poorest, sickest, least technologically connected and least respected people in the country.\"  Swearengin said she is running for U.S. Senate because a change in the power dynamic is needed.  \"The elites have run this country for too long, whether their names are Manchin, Clinton, Trump, Rockefeller, Bush, Blankenship, Jenkins, Murray or Justice,\" she said. \"It is time to take on this power elite head-on, and I intend to do it.\"  Swearengin said she will take a different approach to the opioid epidemic.  \"You have heard every candidate say they are going to fix this problem, and yet no one has issued a plan other than 'lock them up,'\" she said. \"That changes starting with my first term in office. I have visited with chronic substance users, law enforcement, judges, treatment centers and recovery groups. They all tell me the same thing: 'We can't lock our way up out of this situation.' We have a self-defeating system where legislators get elected from writing get-tough legislation, police officers are under pressure to make more arrests and prosecutors make a name for themselves by demanding maximum sentences - all of this for a problem that we all agree is more of a public health problem than anything else.  \"With the experts, I am in the process of developing a multipronged approach to work with the users in a true public health model that includes treatment, replacement therapy, Narcan on demand, safe injection sites, decriminalization and regulation of narcotics to eliminate deadly substances like fentanyl and long-term recovery options.\"  Swearengin also favors cannabis legalization.  \"I believe cannabis should be legalized for both medical and recreational use as soon as possible,\" she said. \"West Virginia is losing millions of dollars in tax revenue to states that have legalized or are in the process of legalizing marijuana. Again, if it's regulated, we can monitor the distributors and the purity, thereby moving marijuana from the streets to the pharmacies and dispensaries. Marijuana is not going away. Let's make it legal, safe and taxable.\"  The primary election is Tuesday, May 8.","articles_date":"28 4 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.herald-dispatch.com\/elections\/manchin-swearengin-face-off-in-democrat-primary-for-us-senate\/article_ee77d763-05ab-5053-a34f-f2c865a56587.html","articles_title":"Manchin, Swearengin face off in Democrat primary for US Senate","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":6,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":8},{"article_text":"Republican Virginia state Delegate Nick Freitas gained national attention earlier this month after a video of a speech he made on the floor of the House of Delegates defending Second Amendment supporters against vicious attacks went viral.  In the speech, he fought back against the politically correct overreach that\u2019s become all too common \u2013 specifically, Democrats in the Virginia Legislature who demonized law-abiding citizens who support \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms\u201d guaranteed by the  Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  A video of Freitas\u2019 floor speech has received 15 million views on his Facebook page, where he said: \u201cFor several days now, some Democrats in the Virginia House of Delegates have made public speeches comparing those of us who take our oath to the Constitution seriously, to include the Second Amendment, to Nazis and segregationists.\u201d  The speech given by Freitas, a former Army Green Beret who served two tours in Iraq, put him on the map virtually overnight in the Virginia U.S. Senate race, where he hopes to win the Republicans nomination to run against Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November.  Freitas\u2019 action is a prime example of the inevitable, growing backlash against the political correctness that increasingly permeates every facet of our lives.  After the tragic shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14 that claimed 17 lives, businesses were attacked and pressured to take a side against the National Rifle Association and its 5 million law-abiding members.  FedEx was the exception \u2013 pledging to keep discounts it offers to NRA members \u2013 but other companies caved to extreme, politically correct demands to take an anti-NRA stance.  Delta Airlines, headquartered in Atlanta, capitulated to the PC pressure, announcing it would no longer offer discounts to NRA members. The backlash was fierce as the Georgia Legislature removed a $40 million tax break for Delta as part of a tax cut package that eventually passed.  So to deny just 13 discounts, Delta flushed a $40 million tax break. Maybe Delta\u2019s shareholders are as PC as its leadership; if not, expect the next shareholder meeting to be very interesting.  Are we really now living in a world where all private businesses are going to be forced to take sides on political hot-button issues?  The obsession with political correctness has invaded the entertainment world as well. As we\u2019ve recently witnessed, the Academy Awards show was completely overrun by PC politics.  Every year it seems we see less entertainment and more political posturing by people paid to entertain us \u2013 not to deliver political lectures. This year, the ratings for the Oscars continued to plunge, down 20 percent from last year.  You would think liberal politicians, PC executives and Hollywood would\u2019ve all gotten the memo by now: America\u2019s backlash against political correctness is one reason why President Trump got elected. But these people don\u2019t deal in facts. They\u2019d rather double down and continue their bully tactics.  Freitas called for an honest dialogue of mutual respect in his speech, yet Democrats walked out. Democratic Delegate Joseph Lindsey said Freitas\u2019 speech offended him more than he\u2019s ever been offended since being elected to the House of Delegates, and Democratic Delegate Lamont Bagby said Freitas\u2019 comments were \u201chateful and divisive.\u201d  Specifically the Democrats were offended when Freitas argued the facts when pushing back against the character assassination of on the left. Freitas said: \"It was not our party that supported slavery, that fought women's suffrage, that rounded up tens of thousands of Asian Americans and put them in concentrations camps, that supported Jim Crow, that supported segregation, or supported mass resistance \u2013 that wasn't our party, that was the Democrat Party.\u201d  The truth hurts.  This is the road of \u201ctolerance,\u201d laced with political correctness and rank hypocrisy, that says we can call you a Nazi and a segregationist but when you throw facts back at us and try to have a respectful dialogue, that road becomes a one-way street.  Freitas spoke passionately about looking beyond gun control as a solution to school shootings. He noted that gun-free zones have not deterred gun violence in schools. In addition, he encouraged long overdue scrutiny into policies enacted by liberals that have led to broken homes.  In this age of politically correct overreach attempting to infiltrate every part of society, it is a breath of fresh air to see an elected leader with the courage to start an honest, respectful dialogue built upon undeniable truths.  Delegate Freitas displayed courage we can only hope to have when he served in Iraq as a soldier defending our country. It\u2019s refreshing to see a leader who won\u2019t be bullied by politicians in a state legislature \u2013 or the U.S. Senate, where we just might see him next year.","articles_date":"16 3 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/2018\/03\/16\/gop-legislator-calls-out-democratic-hate-speech-on-second-amendment.html","articles_title":"A GOP legislator calls out Democratic hate speech on the Second Amendment","candidate_fk":9,"first_name":"Nicholas","id":1,"last_name":"Freitas","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":2,"issue":6},{"article_text":"One of the Republican candidates facing Sen.

That might be expected on a college campus but it should still be encouraging for candidates and Republican Party officials to see so much interest from young voters.  UVA College Republicans Freitas Stewart JacksonAt the same time, however, it should be worrisome for those same candidates and party officials that the audience was overwhelmingly male, demonstrating (anecdotally, at least) that the GOP faces a gender gap as it challenges incumbent Senator Tim Kaine (D-Richmond) in November and as it defends seven of eleven congressional seats against Democratic opponents.  The debate, moderated by Batten School Dean Allan C. Stam, was delightfully civil. Not only were there no catcalls or demonstrations from the audience, the three candidates \u2014 Delegate Nick Freitas, Bishop E.W. Jackson, and Prince William County Board Chairman Corey Stewart \u2014 treated each other and their listeners with respect. There were few instances of snarky comments from any of the participants and, what\u2019s more, the discussion was entirely policy-focused. There were no questions about character, temperament, reputation, or moral shortcomings aimed at one candidate or another.  The three candidates agreed that there should be reform of marijuana laws, with Stewart suggesting that legal medical marijuana is a partial solution to the opioid crisis \u2014 although his primary solution is to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d at the Mexican border to keep out both illegal drugs and illegal immigrants.  All three expressed dismay at the passage of the omnibus spending bill, which was pushed through Congress by Republican leadership and signed into law by a Republican president. Each warned, at one point or another, that the Social Security system is headed toward collapse and that continued deficit spending and accumulation of debt is a national security issue. (They may be unconsciously echoing Libertarian Senate candidate Matt Waters, who has declared this issue as the centerpiece of his campaign.)  Delegate Freitas repeatedly mentioned his military service \u2014 two tours in Iraq, training South Korean special forces \u2014 as well as his experience in the General Assembly as preparation for the U.S. Senate, noting in particular his bill to reform civil asset forfeiture laws, which, he said, had the support of both the Family Foundation and the ACLU.  Bishop Jackson said his experience as a statewide candidate in 2013, when he was the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, prepared him to challenge Tim Kaine. He praised the United States for making it possible for him, the great-grandson of slaves, to run for the United States Senate, and said that participation in the democratic process should not be limited, whether a citizen is black or white, transgender or gay, rich or poor.  For his part, Chairman Stewart stated he was not campaigning to \u201cmake friends,\u201d asserted that anthropogenic climate change is \u201ca hoax,\u201d and called high-school gun control advocate David Hogg a \u201cpunk.\u201d He said that mayors and other public officials who choose not to cooperate in federal immigration-law enforcement efforts should be prosecuted and jailed.

Tim Kaine in November outraised his two GOP primary rivals in the first three months of this year.  Del. Nicholas J. \u201cNick\u201d Freitas (Culpeper), in his third year in Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates, took in $343,712 in the first quarter, according to the most recent reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.  That is more than what Republican contenders Corey A. Stewart and E.W. Jackson, both veterans of past statewide races, took in over the same period.  Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors who narrowly lost last year\u2019s GOP gubernatorial primary to Ed Gillespie, raised $219,952 between January and March. Jackson, a Chesapeake minister who was his party\u2019s nominee for lieutenant governor in 2013, raised $137,078.  Freitas, a former Green Beret who announced his bid in January, also had more cash on hand than his rivals, with $251,694 going into April.  Stewart was the first of the three to jump into the race, and that head start has allowed him to raise more overall. He has brought in $608,662 since he announced his bid in July. Stewart spent $254,721 in the first three months of this year, leaving him $140,502 in the bank.  Jackson had $35,495 in cash on hand.  Stewart\u2019s heavy spending represents a shift in strategy since the gubernatorial primary, when he was considered the underdog. With provocative calls to preserve Confederate monuments and crack down on illegal immigration, Stewart could largely rely on news coverage and not advertising to get his message out in that race.  [Republicans seeking to unseat Kaine embrace Trump at Liberty University debate]  Now, Stewart is widely seen as the front-runner, given how close he came to toppling the better-funded Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who eventually lost the governor\u2019s race to Ralph Northam (D).  Whoever wins the June 12 primary is likely to be massively outspent by Kaine (D), a former governor and his party\u2019s candidate for vice president in 2016.  Kaine has raised $16 million for the race, $2 million of it in the first quarter of 2018. He had more than $10.3 million on hand heading into April, even after spending $959,798 in the first quarter.  Freitas\u2019s donors included N.W. \u201cHap\u201d Chalmers, a retired Dominion Energy employee, and his wife, Rebecca, a Tidewater Community College professor. They each gave $2,700. Travis Brown, a Midlothian, Tex., doctor, gave $2,000.  Stewart\u2019s contributors included L.R. Carr, a stay-at-home mom from Shenandoah County who listed her employer as \u201cMy kids.\u201d She gave $50. On the higher end was Tony Lundy, owner of a Danville company that refurbishes commercial trash bins, and Jongil Kim, a Manassas developer. They gave $1,000 and $2,500, respectively.  Jackson drew considerable support from out-of-state donors, including Lee Roy Mitchell of Dallas, founder of Cinemark theaters, who gave $2,500. Paavo Ensio, a retired Arizona mining executive, gave $2,700. He also received $2,700 from William B. Holtzman, an oil company executive and father of state Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Fauquier), who ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor last year.  Kaine\u2019s donors included Marilyn W. Bos, a Leesburg teacher who gave $250, and John V.

Suddenly, the boy fell to the ground.  Bryan Mackey thought his son had tripped or passed out, and reached to pick him up. \u201cWhen I had him in my hands, I looked at his face and I knew he wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Bryan Mackey told reporters at the time. \u201cI could see it in his eyes, that blank look in his face.\u201d  Brendon had been struck in the head and killed by a random bullet that authorities believe had been fired into the air in celebration. Police have yet to find the person who fired the fatal shot.  Brendon, who was about to start third grade at C. E. Curtis Elementary School in Chester, was one of more than 620 children in Virginia and 26,000 nationwide fatally shot since 1999, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Virginia victims included 80 children age 10 and younger. Three died in gun incidents before reaching their first birthday, a Capital News Service analysis of the data found. Nationally, about 3,000 children 10 and under \u2013 including more than 180 who hadn\u2019t turned 1 \u2013 have been fatally shot since 1999.  The mass shooting that killed 14 students and three teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Valentine\u2019s Day has propelled the debate over gun violence into the national conversation. Students who survived the massacre and their counterparts across the country have declared \u201cNever again\u201d and advocated for gun law reforms.  While mass shootings are relatively rare, gun-related deaths of minors \u2013 age 17 and younger \u2013 are distressingly common. In 2016, the most recent year for which data are available, 39 minors in Virginia and about 1,640 nationwide died as a result of guns.  Accidents like the tragedy involving Brendon Mackey represented 7 percent of all gun-related deaths of minors in Virginia since 1999. Thirty-seven percent of the deaths were suicides, and 53 percent were assaults. The remaining deaths were undetermined.  \u201cOur kids have become collateral damage for the unacceptable policies of the gun lobbies,\u201d said Lori Haas, Virginia director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.  Haas became involved with the issue after her daughter Emily, 19, was shot and injured in the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, when a gunman killed 32 people. When it comes to gun deaths of minors, Haas said, \u201cEven one is too many.\u201d  The statistics on gun-related deaths  Nationally, of every 100,000 Americans age 17 and under, two are killed by gunfire each year, according to the CDC data. In Virginia, the rate is 1.9 gun-related deaths per 100,000 minors. The highest rates in the nation are 9 deaths per 100,000 minors in the District of Columbia, 5.5 in Alaska and 4.1 in Louisiana.  The data showed a distinction between younger children and older ones. Since 1999 in Virginia:  139 children age 13 and under were fatally shot. About 66 percent of those deaths were classified as assaults, 20 percent as accidents and 11 percent as suicides. 482 Virginians between 14 and 17 died from gunfire. Almost half of the deaths \u2013 49 percent \u2013 were assaults, 44 percent were suicides and nearly 3 percent were accidents. Those numbers show that suicide is more prevalent among older children than younger ones \u2013 a fact underscored by the Virginia Violent Death Reporting System. That system found that Virginians age 15 to 19 were seven times more likely to commit suicide than those age 10-14.  The CDC data show that 44 percent of minors killed by guns in Virginia were African-American. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 20 percent of Virginians are African-American. This indicates that black children are fatally shot at a disproportionately high rate in the state.  The debate over gun control  In March, thousands of Virginians participated in the international March for Our Lives, protesting government inaction on gun control legislation. About 5,000 people, including students and politicians, marched on the state Capitol. The protests came after a legislative session in which members of the General Assembly clashed over dozens of bills involving gun regulation.  Lawmakers proposed more than 70 gun-related bills. Some sought to restrict access to guns, including by children. Others sought to expand gun rights, including letting people bring guns to church. In the end, only two of the bills passed. Both have been signed into law by Gov. Ralph Northam:  House Bill 287, introduced by Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, will create a specialty license plate with the message \u201cStop Gun Violence.\u201d Senate Bill 669, sponsored by Sen. R. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, seeks to keep guns out of the hands of Virginians age 14 or older who have been ordered to get mental health treatment. Under this law, which took effect immediately on April 18, such individuals face restrictions on purchasing, owning and transporting firearms. SB 669 was meant to address what Haas and other gun control proponents call \u201cvictims of access.\u201d This is the idea that even when children are involved in gun-related accidents or deaths, they are victims of negligence by people who allowed them access to the weapons.  Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, tried to address that issue by introducing a measure making it a Class 1 misdemeanor to knowingly give a child of 4 or younger access to firearms.  Lopez said he was motivated to sponsor House Bill 950 by the manyincidents in which children in the state accidentally end up shooting themselves orothers.  \u201cRegardless of what you think about the Second Amendment, I think we can all agree that the Founding Fathers were not talking about 2- and 3-year-olds,\u201d Lopez said.  HB 950 died in the House Militia, Police and Public Safety Committee.  Republican opposition to such legislation has largely centered on concerns over Second Amendment rights. Del. Nicholas Freitas, R-Culpeper, was one of the most vocal opponents of gun control legislation in the 2018 session.  When the debate was coming to a head in the General Assembly in March, after the Florida shooting, Freitas gave a speech defending his party\u2019s position in the gun debate. Freitas said the ultimate goal of gun control legislation from Democrats was to \u201cgut the Second Amendment.\u201d  \u201cWhen the policies fail to produce the results you are promising your constituents, you\u2019ll be back with more reasons to infringe on Second Amendment rights,\u201d Freitas told Democrats in the House.  But during the legislative session after Brendon Mackey\u2019s death, the General Assembly was moved to action. In 2014, lawmakers passed a pair of bills making it a felony to injure someone through the reckless use of firearms.  \u201cAny person who handles any firearm in a manner so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life and causes the serious bodily injury of another person resulting in permanent and significant physical impairment is guilty of a Class 6 felony,\u201d the legislation stated.  The bills were aimed at preventing accidents as a result of celebratory gunfire. Supporters dubbed the legislation \u201cBrendon\u2019s Law.\u201d","articles_date":"6 5 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.insidenova.com\/news\/politics\/dozens-of-children-fatally-shot-in-virginia-each-year\/article_7fdfee30-511e-11e8-9050-4b5d36ef1019.html","articles_title":"Dozens of children fatally shot in Virginia each year","candidate_fk":9,"first_name":"Nicholas","id":1,"last_name":"Freitas","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2,"issue":3},{"article_text":"Del.

Luke Torian, D-Prince William, becomes emotional as he begins a floor speech criticizing a speech by Del. Nicholas J. Freitas, R-Culpeper during the session of the Virginia House of Delegates. Torian was joined by other members of the black caucus in objecting to the Republican's floor speech on gun control, abortion and slavery. (Bob Brown\/AP) Stewart\u2019s 12 years as chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors and two statewide campaigns, including his near-win in the gubernatorial primary last year, make him the most widely known of six Republicans seeking the Senate nod.  But he\u2019s also a bomb thrower who waves the Confederate flag, demonizes undocumented immigrants and recently said he felt bad for the wives of \u201cflaccid\u201d fellow Republicans in the General Assembly.  Stewart\u2019s approach unnerves Republicans who haven\u2019t won a statewide race since 2009 and watched their party take a shellacking at the polls in 2017, in a massive backlash to President Trump.  While very conservative in his own right, Freitas, 38, could be the fresh-faced antidote to all that, they say.  \u201cIt\u2019s rare that you have somebody with the characteristics that Nick has,\u201d said Morton Blackwell, Virginia\u2019s representative on the Republican National Committee. \u201cHe\u2019s an extraordinarily dynamic person. The news that there have been millions and millions of people viewing that speech of his is very good news. I had seen it and liked it but, wow, that\u2019s great.\u201d  Blackwell, who backed Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie last year and Stewart in his unsuccessful 2013 bid for lieutenant governor, said he wished Stewart had been more supportive of Gillespie after he beat Stewart for the GOP nomination for governor.  \u201cA lot of people have high name identification,\u201d he said, without naming Stewart. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people are going to vote for them. I would say there\u2019s a pretty good correlation between the people who know Nick Freitas and the people who are going to vote for him. That can\u2019t be said in every election.\u201d  Besides Blackwell, Freitas has the endorsements of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and former governor Robert F. McDonnell.  Stewart, who has been praised by populist heroes Stephen K. Bannon and Laura Ingraham, isn\u2019t interested in endorsements from establishment politicians.  \u201c[Freitas] is not going to be able to rally Trump voters,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThere are a lot of conservatives out there who want a fighter, who want somebody who\u2019s going to support the president.\u201d  Freitas now backs Trump, but in deleted social media posts from 2015 and 2016, Freitas referred to him as a \u201c5 time draft deferring \u2018tough guy\u2019\u2009\u201d who would \u201ctake some candy from a small child .\u2009.\u2009. or maybe kick a kitten\u201d and said Trump is not the candidate for \u201cliberty minded conservatives.\u201d  John Fredericks, host of a popular conservative radio show who was co-chair of Trump\u2019s Virginia campaign after Stewart was fired from the post, said Freitas has a shot, but Stewart is the favorite. Anyone who runs against him has to be as aggressive as he is, Fredericks said.  \u201cThe thing is, if you don\u2019t respond to Corey he\u2019s going to blow your head off,\u201d he said. \u201cCorey plays to win. He goes to a slingshot fight and he brings a bazooka.\u201d  When he announced his campaign, Freitas pledged not to attack his GOP competitors, but three months later, he says he won\u2019t let personal attacks go unanswered.  He raised concerns that Stewart staff members and volunteers in comments online poked fun at his last name, which is Portuguese, and misrepresented his positions.  \u201cIf Corey decides he wants to make the main thrust of his campaign to attack me,\u201d he said, without suggesting that will happen, \u201cI\u2019m going to defend myself. I think it would be very unwise for Corey to try to come after me.\u201d  Freitas, who is in his second term in the House of Delegates representing a rural Piedmont district, enlisted in the Army after high school, rose to the Special Forces and served two combat tours in Iraq.  \u201cHe went full mission and said if I\u2019m going to execute the mission you need to know where I stand and I\u2019m not going to be pushed around,\u201d said Denver Riggleman, a Republican distillery owner who briefly ran for governor last year and has endorsed Freitas.  In his seven-minute screed, Freitas said he tried to convey how Democrats who compare gun-rights advocates to Nazis or segregationists shut down any chance for a real debate.  \u201cIt was not our party that supported slavery, that fought women\u2019s suffrage, that rounded up tens of thousands of Asian Americans and put them in concentration camps, that supported Jim Crow, that supported segregation or supported mass resistance.

It didn\u2019t quite come out that way.  Citing a Brookings Institution study, he said, \u201cvarious cultural changes that happened in the \u201960s to include the abortion industry,\u201d contributed to more out-of-wedlock-births and broken families.  \u201cI\u2019m not blaming single mothers,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI grew up with a single mother. But I do think it\u2019s important for us to take a look at all of the different factors that have gone into an increase of violence.\u201d  Freitas\u2019s remarks visibly upset several Democrats, many of them African American, and they walked off the House floor in protest.  While Republicans applauded the speech, some said Freitas could have better framed his argument.  \u201cNick was trying to make a very passionate speech about a right that many people hold dear and other people took away from it what they did based on their own experiences,\u201d said House Majority Leader C.

Nick Freitas, one of the contenders to unseat U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, has gotten more than 10 million views for his speech on the floor earlier this month. One expert says that helped his chances of getting the Republican nomination, but when it comes to the general election, he\u2019s not so sure.  On March 2, Freitas, R-Culpeper, rose to address recent criticisms of the Republican Party for its long-standing resistance to gun control, particularly after the Florida school shooting. He said that \u201cthe welfare state contributed significantly to dismantling the family,\u201d leading to the broken homes that he claimed many mass shooters come from, and cited \u201cthe abortion industry\u201d as one of \u201cvarious cultural changes [from] the Sixties\u201d that contributed to the problem.  He also claimed that a recently defeated ban on bump stocks failed because no Republicans believe that gun-control efforts would stop there, and said of the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II, resistance to women\u2019s suffrage, segregation and Jim Crow, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t our party. That was the Democrat[ic] party.\u201d  The speech got Freitas national-TV recognition and support from conservative personalities such as Lou Dobbs. And Mark Rozell, a professor of public policy at George Mason University, said that it improved his political prospects.  Calling Freitas an \u201cobscure legislator\u201d who won election narrowly, Rozell said, \u201cIn one speech he propelled himself into substantially higher name recognition.\u201d  Until that speech, Rozell said, Freitas was the choice of moderate Republicans in the field to unseat Kaine \u2014 \u201can alternative to Corey Stewart and E.W. Jackson, two fiery populists who appeal to the far-right wing of the Republican Party.\u201d  Now Freitas is in the same category, Rozell said.  \u201cReady to dust it up in the rhetoric \u2026 in order to get attention for himself, which he\u2019s done fantastically.\u201d  That helps his chance of getting the nomination, Rozell said, adding Stewart \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a real chance\u201d after his previous defeats, and Jackson was \u201cdefeated handily\u201d in his last couple of runs.  \u2018Where the votes are\u2019 Rozell added that he didn\u2019t think there was a great deal of difference between Freitas and Stewart on policy, though he considered Freitas a bit more libertarian.  But the abortion comments, particularly, were directed toward religious and social conservatives, \u201cwho have a substantial impact on who get the nomination\u201d in the Republican Party, Rozell said. In a low-turnout primary, \u201cIt\u2019s the hard-core conservatives who are going to show up, and show up in big numbers. That\u2019s where the votes are.\u201d  Even so, Rozell said, any run against Kaine is \u201ca real long shot,\u201d Rozell said. The incumbent is \u201cfairly popular,\u201d with all the advantages of the office \u2014 name recognition, fundraising and a \u201cfairly credible\u201d record. Not to mention what Rozell called \u201cthe blue trending of Virginia.\u201d No Republican has won a statewide race since 2009.  \u201cI think many Republicans actually wish that some other big-name Republican \u2026 would step forward,\u201d Rozell said, adding gossip has centered around former presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and others, \u201cbut that just has not materialized.\u201d","articles_date":"12 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/wtop.com\/virginia\/2018\/03\/va-del-freitas-speech-drew-attention-votes\/","articles_title":"Va.

Del. Nick Freitas (R-Culpeper) set off the reaction with remarks that began by defending Republican resistance to gun-control measures in the wake of the Florida school shooting, but wound up blaming \u201cthe abortion industry\u201d for fostering a broken society and castigating the Democratic Party for segregation and the Japanese internment camps of World War II.  He was responding to recent criticism that Republicans have blood on their hands for failing to act on gun violence. \u201cI would really appreciate it if every time you want to make a powerful point, you don\u2019t project the sins, the atrocities and the injustices that the Democratic Party perpetrated onto others onto us,\u201d said Freitas, who is running for the Republican nomination to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine this year. Four others are seeking the GOP nomination, including Corey Stewart, the chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, who equates gun control with castration and is holding campaign events at gun ranges.  [On the same day, Tim Kaine meets with mothers about gun control while Corey Stewart visits shooting range]  After Democrats settled down, Del. Joseph Lindsey (D-Norfolk) told the House that \u201ctoday, I have been offended as I can never recall since being a part of this body. And I have seen many of my colleagues emotionally shaken and bothered by either a lack of concern for facts or just simply playing to the cameras, I don\u2019t know which.\u201d  The gun issue has bubbled beneath the surface of a legislative session otherwise marked by self-conscious bipartisan cooperation. The Republican leadership of the House killed dozens of gun-control bills introduced by Democrats, including measures to expand background checks, ban the \u201cbump stocks\u201d that increase firing rates and enabling families to have weapons confiscated from dangerous loved ones.  [Bipartisanship in Virginia does not extend to gun legislation]  The issue had faded to the background behind high-profile, bipartisan efforts to expand Medicaid, pass utility regulation and approve bills to restructure criminal justice. But since the Valentine\u2019s Day shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 people dead, Democrats have tried to draw more attention to guns.  Several have made floor speeches, and on Thursday House Democrats called on Republicans to revive some of the bills that never made it out of committees.  But it took a sleepy Friday session, with high winds whipping outside the Capitol and delegates eager to wrap up early and head to their home districts, for the tension to finally erupt.  Freitas took the floor of the House during a time set aside for members to make remarks on any topic. He started calmly, arguing that facts and data should be part of the debate about how to prevent gun violence.  Many of the perpetrators of recent mass shootings have come from broken homes, he said. Studies show that the breakdown in families \u201ccan be attributed to various cultural changes [from] the Sixties to include the abortion industry,\u201d Freitas said, to groans from Democrats. \u201cThe welfare state contributed significantly to dismantling the family,\u201d he continued.  Freitas defended the Second Amendment and decried government efforts to stop people from defending themselves. Democrats really only see one solution to societal violence, he said: \u201ctearing apart or gutting the Second Amendment\u201d and banning all guns.  Why do Republicans resist debating a ban on bump stocks? \u201cBecause quite frankly, I don\u2019t think any of us on this side of the aisle believe you when you say that\u2019s all you want to do,\u201d Freitas said.  Instead, Democrats just want to demonize their opponents, \u201ccomparing members on this side of the aisle to Nazis,\u201d he said, referring to an email Del. Mark Levine (D-Alexandria) sent out to supporters last month that slammed Republicans for supporting assault weapons similar to those \u201ccreated by Nazi Germany.\u201d  Freitas criticized a letter from a 24-year-old teacher, which Del. Dawn Adams (D-Richmond) read a few days ago, in which the teacher said she worried that politicians were debating between the Second Amendment and her life. And Freitas was especially upset, he said, by a recent comment from Del. Ken Plum (D-Fairfax) comparing the gun rights issue to segregation.  \u201cI just want to remind everyone of something very quickly. It was not our party that supported slavery, that fought women\u2019s suffrage, that rounded up tens of thousands of Asian Americans and put them in concentration camps, that supported Jim Crow, that supported segregation or supported mass resistance. That wasn\u2019t our party. That was the Democrat party,\u201d he said.  At this point large numbers of Democrats, including most of the Black Caucus, got up and left the chamber. Even a few Republicans slipped out.  Freitas said that if Democrats want to have an honest debate on gun issues, it should \u201cstart with a certain degree of mutual respect.\u201d They shouldn\u2019t assume he has been bought off by the NRA, he said, and he wouldn\u2019t assume Democrats were paid off by Planned Parenthood.  After seven minutes, he finished to applause from many Republicans, and most of the Democrats came back into the chamber.  But after another Republican, Del. Thomas Wright Jr. (R-Lunenberg), who chairs the subcommittee that shelved most gun-control bills, stood and blamed gun violence on school systems that stopped teaching about God, Democrats began leaving the chamber again.  Del. David Toscano (D-Charlottesville), the House minority leader, asked for a recess.  A few Republicans, including Del. Greg Habeeb (R-Salem), huddled with several Democrats to try to smooth things over. But Del. Lamont Bagby (D-Henrico), who heads the Legislative Black Caucus, was steamed.  It\u2019s one thing to make a political point about the NRA and Planned Parenthood, he told Habeeb, but suggesting that it was Republicans who were \u201cfreeing my people? I mean, come on.\u201d  When they returned from a 15-minute recess, the Democrats had Lindsey \u2014 who is African American and seldom speaks on the House floor \u2014 make a few remarks to express their unhappiness and call for civility.  The calm only lasted a moment, though.  Del. Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah), the House majority leader, stood for remarks of his own. He first thanked Lindsey, but quickly worked himself into a lather over guns. \u201cWe have sat here for a week and listened to the other side of the aisle accuse us in every different way that they can .\u2009.\u2009. of being complicit with Nazis and terrorists and al-Qaeda,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes we can only take about so much of that.\u201d  As Gilbert grew more agitated, at one point saying the idea of holding criminals accountable is not \u201cin high favor\u201d among Democrats anymore, Toscano began interrupting with protests to Speaker M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights).  Cox warned Gilbert that he had only two minutes more to speak. \u201cEveryone take a deep breath,\u201d Cox said.  During the hubbub, Adams, the Democrat who had spoken a few days ago about the 24-year-old teacher who was distraught over guns, made her way over to Freitas\u2019s desk and spoke with him.  \u201cI just wanted to figure out what was going on with him. That\u2019s all,\u201d she said later. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to finish our conversation.\u201d","articles_date":"2 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/virginia-politics\/gun-control-issue-boils-over-in-virginia-house-after-fiery-speech-from-delegate\/2018\/03\/02\/991938d4-1e42-11e8-ae5a-16e60e4605f3_story.html?utm_term=.2e858199d921","articles_title":"Gun-control issue boils over in Virginia House after fiery speech from delegate","candidate_fk":9,"first_name":"Nicholas","id":1,"last_name":"Freitas","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2,"issue":3},{"article_text":"HOT SPRINGS, Va. \u2014 Under a banner declaring \u201cLiberty Rising\u201d at a gathering of Virginia Republicans, Del. Nick Freitas (R-Culpeper) announced late Friday that he will seek his party\u2019s nomination to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine (D) next year.  Freitas will compete for the nomination against Corey Stewart, the bombastic chair of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors who has fashioned himself after President Trump.  [After near miss in primary for governor, Stewart promises a \u201cvicious\u201d campaign against Ka ine]  The move is likely to reassure some state and national Republican leaders who have been nervous about Stewart becoming the face of the party in a purple state where Trump is deeply unpopular.  [Anybody but Corey Stewart? GOP leaders search for an alternative]  Stewart narrowly lost the primary for governor in June after pledging to crack down on illegal immigration and preserve Confederate heritage.  But Freitas, who was just elected to a second term last month, is not exactly a mainstream figure. At his announcement in a cramped hotel suite at the Homestead resort, the 38-year-old federal contractor delivered a treatise on small government, promising to combat a worldview that \u201ctreats free people as if we were subjects instead of citizens.\u201d  \u201cQuite frankly, establishment elements from both sides of the aisle have been responsible in thinking themselves made from finer clay than the rest of humanity,\u201d Freitas said.  In response to his announcement, Virginia Democratic Party Chairwoman Susan Swecker lumped Freitas and Stewart together and called the state GOP out of touch.  \u201cThis extremist duo of candidates in the race supports Donald Trump\u2019s dangerous plans, and neither of them would put Virginia families before their nutty agenda,\u201d she said in a statement.  With a conservative voting record and libertarian streak, Freitas expected to line up support from Republicans hoping to rebrand the party with a fresh face. He has sought advice from Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Mike Lee (Utah) and members of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus.  Others are waiting to see how the field shapes up. Evangelical pastor E.W. Jackson is preparing to announce, former governor James S. Gilmore III is considering it, Army veteran Ivan Raiklin filed the paperwork, and policy expert John Norton Moore may run.  Kaine \u2014 a popular and well-funded former mayor, lieutenant governor and governor \u2014 is seeking a second term after delivering Virginia for Democrats as Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice-presidential running mate in 2016.  Freitas said he wouldn\u2019t \u201csugarcoat\u201d the challenge ahead but dismissed critics who warned him the race would damage his political career, saying that wasn\u2019t his priority.  He also pledged not to attack his GOP competitors, a refreshing concept to some Republicans weary after the nasty gubernatorial primary between Stewart and Ed Gillespie.  \u201cI\u2019m not here to bash my fellow Republicans,\u201d Freitas said. \u201cPeriod. The end.\u201d  Raised in California by a single mother who ran a GOP women\u2019s group, Freitas, 38, joined the Army after high school, became a Green Beret and served 11 years active duty.  In the House of Delegates, he is known for giving passionate floor speeches, such as his 2016 defense of Sgt. 1st Class Charles Martland, who was facing discharge for beating up an Afghan commander who allegedly raped a small boy.  He is a member of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association.","articles_date":"9 12 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/virginia-politics\/del-nick-freitas-jumps-into-gop-field-to-challenge-sen-tim-kaine-in-2018\/2017\/12\/09\/af6f240a-dc6a-11e7-b859-fb0995360725_story.html?utm_term=.f12d4069b711","articles_title":"Del.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., next year, according to GOP insiders.  The new contender would be Del. Nicholas J. Freitas, R-Culpeper, an Iraq combat veteran first elected to the General Assembly in 2015 and easily re-elected this year. Freitas would join Corey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, in seeking the GOP nomination.  Freitas supporters in a Facebook group called Draft Nick Freitas for U.S. Senate have been calling on him to run.  Freitas did not return a phone call, but said two weeks ago in an interview on the John Fredericks radio talk show that he would soon announce a decision on whether to run.  Republicans will gather at The Omni Homestead Resort in Hot Springs the weekend of Dec. 8 for their annual Advance, a weekend of speeches, hobnobbing and politicking. Candidates for office often host hospitality suites.  \u201cI hope to see you all at the Advance,\u201d Freitas wrote Nov. 16 in the Draft Freitas Facebook group, ending his post with a winky face emoticon.  Should Freitas announce, he will face a bombastic primary opponent in Stewart, who was a chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in Virginia and has pledged to run a \u201cvicious and ruthless\u201d campaign against Kaine. In a June primary, Stewart narrowly lost the GOP nomination for governor to Ed Gillespie, who then lost the general election to Democrat Ralph Northam.  Stewart centered his gubernatorial campaign on protecting Confederate monuments while attacking Gillespie as an establishment figure, and appeared at an event in February in Charlottesville with Jason Kessler, the man who coordinated the August \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally there that turned deadly.  In October, Stewart mocked transgender House of Delegates candidate Danica Roem over her gender identity. Roem, who is from Stewart\u2019s county, won her race and will join the legislature in January.  Martha Boneta, a GOP activist from Fauquier County, said Freitas is respected by Republicans across the state.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult to attack Nick Freitas. He\u2019s a combat veteran. He would have given his life for this country in combat and he has a great love for his country. He\u2019s the new face of the Republican Party,\u201d said Boneta, who said she is not yet making an endorsement.  \u201cNobody can deny that Corey Stewart is masterful at his ability to use social media \u2014 I should say use media, in general \u2014 by throwing flames. He does have a strong base. At the end of the day, people need to ask themselves who is best to lead Virginia in these unique times that we\u2019re in. And it has to be somebody who\u2019s a fighter and who\u2019s always going to put the constituency, the public, before their own interests.\u201d  Fredericks asked Freitas on the radio show how he\u2019d handle attacks from Stewart.  \u201cHe\u2019s going to paint you as establishment,\u201d said Fredericks, who worked with Stewart on the Trump Virginia campaign before Stewart was fired from the position and remained on as a volunteer. \u201cHe\u2019s going to paint you as basically a Republican Party of Virginia tool of the elected officials and you\u2019re going to have to run into the Corey Stewart chainsaw. Why would you put yourself through that?\u201d  Freitas said he would be running against Kaine, not Stewart.  \u201cI\u2019m not getting into this with the concern of what Corey\u2019s going to say or what Corey\u2019s going to do,\u201d Freitas said. \u201cI\u2019m going to let Corey run his race and I\u2019m going to run mine, if I decide to run.\u201d  Freitas added: \u201cTrying to paint me as establishment is about as ridiculous as you possibly could go. I\u2019ve been in the General Assembly two years. Take a look at my voting record. Take a look at my stances.\u201d  E.W. Jackson of Chesapeake, a minister who was the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor in 2013, also plans to run as a Republican candidate in next year\u2019s Senate primary, according to a spokesman. Jackson is a social conservative who lost the 2013 race to Democrat Ralph Northam.  The Republican Party of Virginia\u2019s central committee has opted for a primary next year to nominate a candidate to challenge Kaine, who is seeking a second term.  \u201cTim Kaine\u2019s definitely going to have a robust challenger next year,\u201d said John Findlay, the party\u2019s executive director.

Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper \u2014 running in a GOP primary for U.S. Senate as the most mainstream-friendly challenger to U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. \u2014 stunned Democrats with an explosive speech pushing back against the minority party\u2019s calls for stronger gun-control laws in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.  Noting that Democrats recently compared Republicans to Nazis, terrorists and \u201csegregationists\u201d while attacking the GOP for being pro-gun, Freitas said Democrats shouldn\u2019t project their own \u201csins\u201d onto their opponents.  \u201cIt was not our party that supported slavery, that fought women\u2019s suffrage, that rounded up tens of thousands of Asian-Americans and put \u2019em in concentration camps, that supported Jim Crow, that supported segregation, or supported Massive Resistance,\u201d Freitas said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t our party. That was the Democrat party.\u201d  Coming on a Friday expected to be uneventful and short, the ruckus cast a sour mood over the House as lawmakers headed home before the final week of the session.  Saying many mass shooters come from \u201cbroken homes,\u201d Freitas ticked off a series of reports and statistics and suggested abortion, \u201cthe welfare state\u201d and other cultural shifts that began in the 1960s have weakened families.  If Republicans can be accused of being in the pocket of the National Rifle Association, Freitas said, the same can be said of Democrats and the groups that support them.  \u201cWhen I get up here and I talk about abortion, I don\u2019t assume that you\u2019re all bought and paid for by Planned Parenthood. I don\u2019t assume you\u2019re horrible people because I disagree with you on a policy position,\u201d Freitas said.  Though Freitas framed his speech as a call for \u201cmutual respect,\u201d the comments shattered the House\u2019s usually collegial atmosphere, prompting several visibly upset Democrats, many of them African-American, to walk off the floor.  \u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, told a colleague as she left the chamber.  House Minority Leader David Toscano, D-Charlottesville, asked for a short recess, apparently to allow Democrats to gather their thoughts. Del. Dawn Adams, D-Richmond, approached Freitas at his desk for what appeared to be a tense conversation.  When lawmakers returned, Del. Joseph Lindsey, D-Norfolk, said the comments left him more offended than he\u2019s ever been since he was elected to the body in 2014.  \u201cI have seen many of my colleagues emotionally shaken and bothered by either a lack of concern for facts or just simply playing to the cameras,\u201d Lindsey said.  House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, then rose to say the party that routinely suggests Republicans have blood on their hands for defending gun rights was getting a taste of its own medicine.  \u201cIt\u2019s too much for many of us to stomach,\u201d Gilbert said.  Tensions flared again as Gilbert went on to suggest Democrats no longer care about holding criminals accountable for their crimes or making sure students who act out in schools are disciplined.  Toscano interrupted Gilbert to suggest he was violating House rules by telling willful untruths about his opponents.  \u201cWe\u2019d ask the speaker to sanction him for his inappropriate comments,\u201d Toscano said.  House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, trying to keep a lid on what was by far the most heated floor battle of his short tenure running the House, said: \u201cEveryone needs to take a deep breath. The delegate will wrap up his comments.\u201d  Speaking to reporters afterward, Freitas said he was frustrated that Democrats would take offense at a speech meant to convey that Republicans aren\u2019t guilty of the \u201cpretty horrible things\u201d Democrats often accuse them of. Freitas said he wasn\u2019t implying that legalized abortion leads to mass shootings, but that children being born out of wedlock leads to \u201cfar-reaching social ills.\u201d  He said his political campaign wasn\u2019t a factor in his decision to speak.  \u201cI don\u2019t base what I do off of Corey Stewart,\u201d Freitas said. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve given a floor speech on something I\u2019m passionate about.\u201d  A former Green Beret who has served in the House since 2016, Freitas is competing against Prince William Board of County Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart and a handful of others for the GOP nomination to take on Kaine this fall. Stewart, an anti-establishment candidate with a long history of provocative comments, recently questioned the manhood of House Republicans who support Medicaid expansion.  Freitas clashed with Del. Mark Levine, D-Alexandria, earlier this year during a subcommittee debate over guns. After Levine, a lawyer and broadcast political commentator, said that voting against universal background checks is a vote to give guns to gang members and terrorists, Freitas said he didn\u2019t appreciate the comment and said he knew more about fighting terrorists than a \u201cradio personality.\u201d  Republicans were infuriated last month after Levine sent out an email headlined \u201cHow the GOP Makes it Easy to Commit Mass Murder.\u201d  Freitas\u2019 comment about Democrats invoking segregation appeared to a be a reference to a floor speech by Del. Ken Plum, D-Fairfax. On Thursday, Plum compared the students leading the push for gun control to Barbara Johns, a young civil rights pioneer who led a student strike in Prince Edward County to protest substandard facilities at her segregated school.  \u201cI realized, by golly, we\u2019re in another Barbara Johns moment,\u201d Plum said.  As the session winds to a close, House Democrats have been calling on Republicans to reconsider gun-control bills that have already failed, arguing the Florida shooting that left 17 dead demands a legislative response.  Republican leaders have said that\u2019s not possible because of procedural rules that prevent the House from taking up its own bills late in the session as it\u2019s acting on bills that have passed the Senate.  Del. Tommy Wright, R-Lunenburg, the chairman of the House subcommittee that killed most of the Democrats\u2019 gun bills, gave his own floor speech Friday disputing the popular Democratic refrain that \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d are no longer enough after mass shootings.

This astonishing transformation can only be attributed to the presidency of Donald Trump, whose words during the 2016 campaign and during his term in the White House helped make America safe for extremists.  White supremacists, Infowars conspiracy theorists and convicted criminals are running, some as viable candidates, on the GOP ticket on the state and federal level, something which would have been unheard of only a few years ago. Such individuals are not barred from putting their hat in the ring and aspiring for elected office, but it is remarkable that party leaders have by and large not shown the backbone to condemn them. But in a way that's not surprising in a party where extremism and intolerance are mainstream GOP fare, and its standard bearer runs an ethically challenged administration mired in criminal investigations. Trump said he would drain the swamp, but he is the swamp, and he is sending swamp-dwelling creatures to the Senate, Congress and the state house. Nancy Pelosi&#39;s mistake on identity politics Nancy Pelosi's mistake on identity politics A criminal record is no longer a barrier to entry for GOP candidates. There is nothing wrong with people being formerly incarcerated. After all, in a country that preaches rehabilitation yet practices gratuitous imprisonment and punishment for its own sake, society should encourage those who turn over a new leaf and want to contribute to their country through public service. However, keep in mind that we are not talking about the rehabilitated here. The candidates in question are doubling down on corruption and hate in Trump's party. Even former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn -- who is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI in connection with the Russia investigation -- is hitting the campaign trail and stumping for them. Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is running for Senate, after receiving a pardon from Trump for a contempt of court charge for failing to curb his anti-immigrant and anti-Latino racial profiling policies in violation of civil rights. Accused of racism and mistreatment of Latino prisoners, Arpaio failed to investigate over 400 sex crimes -- including the molestation of undocumented children -- made inmates wear pink underwear, called his tent city for inmates a concentration camp, and established the first chain gangs for juveniles and women. Paul Ryan&#39;s firing of Father Conroy should worry us all Paul Ryan's firing of Father Conroy should worry us all Arpaio, a prominent Birther who questioned President Obama's citizenship, received the blessing of Vice President Mike Pence, who, apparently rehearsing for a sooner-than-expected spot in the Oval Office, called Arpaio, \"A great friend of this president, a tireless champion of strong borders and the rule of law.\" In West Virginia, Don Blankenship, the former coal mining company head who went to prison for a year on mine safety charges that were brought after a disaster that killed 29 miners, is challenging Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Blankenship claims it was not racist to call Sen. Mitch McConnell's father-in-law a \"wealthy Chinaperson.\" (Donald Trump Jr. has urged voters in West Virginia to reject Blankenship and a GOP-establishment linked PAC is running ads against him, according to Politico.) In Staten Island, New York, former FBI agent and Rep. Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion, is making a comeback as a Trump loyalist after serving seven months behind bars. During his first stint in Congress, Grimm also threatened to break a reporter \"in half\" in 2014 following President Obama's State of the Union address. Kanye only cares about himself ... just like Trump Kanye only cares about himself ... just like Trump Running against Rep. Maxine Waters in California is Omar Navarro, who pleaded guilty to placing a tracking device on his wife's car. The extreme right wing, pro-Trump candidate has support from Michael Flynn and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and Navarro says Roger Stone serves as his adviser. And Rep. Greg Gianforte, who pleaded guilty to assault after body slamming a reporter, is running for re-election in Montana. Meanwhile, a report from Right Wing Watch, a project of People for the American Way, shines the light on a dozen far-right candidates who, typically inspired by Trump, are driving the Republican Party and American politics to the fringes. One of these people is Arthur Jones, who denies the Holocaust and was denounced as a Nazi by Illinois Republicans, yet became the GOP nominee in Illinois' 3rd district. Another is Paul Nehlen, a white supremacist who is a self-described \"pro-White Christian American candidate\" vying for House Speaker Paul Ryan's seat in Wisconsin. Black Trump supporters Diamond and Silk received $7,000 to star in a campaign ad supporting Nehlen. Twitter permanently banned Nehlen after he posted a photo depicting Prince Harry's biracial fianc\u00e9e Meghan Markle as \"Cheddar Man,\" a 9,000-year old dark-skinned prehistoric Briton.

Some of them even have a chance of winning. This is all the proof you need that the GOP is running to the extremist right, and is threatening to push US politics off the cliff.","articles_date":"28 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/bearingdrift.com\/2018\/03\/28\/road-u-s-senate-freitas-jackson-stewart-square-off-uva\/","articles_title":"Road to the U.S. Senate: Freitas, Jackson, Stewart Square Off at UVA","candidate_fk":10,"first_name":"E.W.","id":5,"last_name":"Jackson","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2,"issue":8},{"article_text":"New York (CNN)Donald Trump argued Tuesday that the American public knows very little about Hillary Clinton's religion, raising questions about how it will impact her leadership should she become president.  \"We don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion,\" he said, speaking to a group of Christian leaders in New York. \"Now, she's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no -- there's nothing out there.

E.W. Jackson, who tweeted video of Trump's remarks, said the comment came while Trump was trying to say that conservatives tend to get questioned more about their faith than liberals. \"I think everybody in there knows Hillary Clinton is a Methodist and by definition a Christian,\" Jackson told CNN. \"He was saying for those of us who are students of the Christian faith -- for evangelicals that can mean everything is thoroughly examined, like what do you believe about marriage? What do you believe about abortion?\" Jackson, who ran as the 2013 Republican nominee for lieutenant governor in Virginia, said he was \"accused of believing all kinds of crazy things\" when he was a politician. \"All (Trump) was saying was she hasn't had that same examination, so we don't really know what she believes,\" he added. Ken Blackwell, a Family Research Council fellow and Ohio politician, praised Trump's comments about \"protecting religious liberty and speech, because I know this administration -- and given that the Hillary administration will be a third term of Barack Obama, she would be a third term in her attack on religious liberty in general.\" \"I have no reason to attack her faith, I just question her ability to defend my right, my family's right, my church's right to practice our faith in the public square,\" Blackwell said. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said there's been \"very little public conversation about (Clinton's) faith.\" \"I think it would be very helpful to hear what her faith is, what the core of her belief is,\" she said.

It's rooted in the values that I've learned from my family and my faith,\" she said Wednesday in Raleigh. \"We have responsibility to lift each other up,\" she added. \"As we Methodists like to say, do all the good you can to all the people you can in all the ways you can.\" While it's true Clinton doesn't regularly talk about her faith, she has had a number of public interactions with people where they discussed her faith.

As the GOP establishment slowly coalesces around the presumptive nominee, the foot soldiers of the movement face an agonizing dilemma: whether to line up behind a candidate many members view as a ideological heretic or to stay true to their principles and reject him -- even though doing so could help Hillary Clinton claim the White House. The self-reflection is particularly acute for members of the influential Council for National Policy, an umbrella network of conservative activists -- the membership of which has been largely secret but can now be exclusively revealed to a greater extent than ever before by CNN. The Council was founded in 1981 by Tim LaHaye, the evangelical minister best known for the \"Left Behind\" series of prophesy-infused fiction books. CNN Politics app Uniting social, fiscal and religious conservatives, the CNP, nicknamed \"The Group,\" has prided itself for years on promoting conservative values and helping grassroots conservatives outside the GOP structure to coordinate and share ideas and information. Its membership is a powerful organizing force behind conservative candidates and has helped to cement the movement's aspirations deep in Republican Party ideology. A copy of the organization's membership list and directory obtained by CNN shows it mixes prominent conservative leaders like Brent Bozell III and Phyllis Schlafly with a smattering of former presidential candidates, business leaders and social activists. The group rarely courts publicity, but its members will be crucial in determining the amount of buy-in from social and evangelical conservatives for Trump's national campaign. Donald Trump's rough few days Trump starts from a position of weakness among CNP members, and the choice is particularly galling for some social conservatives because the 2016 election had seemed to offer the chance of nominating a candidate -- like Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio -- who was squarely in line with their core philosophy. Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council currently heads the executive committee of the CNP, and told CNN in an interview that Trump's takeover of the Republican Party is posing searching questions for the conservative grass-roots. He said it is incumbent upon Trump to reach out with tangible steps to quell anxiety in the movement if he is to ensure a strong GOP turnout in November. Nightcap: The latest news and political buss from CNN Politics | Sign up \"Many conservatives want to be able to be for Donald Trump because they fear the alternative, but they have not yet seen in him what they need to see to make the transition,\" Perkins said. \"There is not a lot that has transpired since Ted Cruz left the race and Donald Trump has been on the path to being the nominee -- he has not done anything that would make people change their minds.\" Another prominent member of the CNP is former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, who said he is \"slow walking\" his embrace of the Trump candidacy. In some ways, Blackwell said, promoting Trump would for conservatives be akin to snatching defeat from the jaws of victory if he does not accept their principles, after generations of trying to put conservative thought at the heart of U.S. government. \"I would say everybody wants to unify and everybody is mindful of the fact and respectful of the fact that Trump has weathered the storm of a primary,\" Blackwell said. \"But the vast majority of us are not ready to jettison our platform or the philosophy that has gotten us to this majority party status, the only other rung is the presidency.\" Better than Clinton Pragmatists among CNP members argue that while Trump may part with conservatives on many core issues -- including reining in the size of government, on opposing entitlement reform and in the often vulgar tone of his campaign, it is already clear he would be better for conservatives than the alternative -- Hillary Clinton. Schlafly, a pioneering conservative activist and founding member of the CNP, said that Trump is not the first Republican candidate to face questions about his personal authenticity as a conservative. Pro-Clinton super PAC to start airing general election ads targeting Trump \"I can remember 1980 when a lot of us didn't think Reagan was an authentic conservative. Reagan turned out to be best president of the century,\" she said. She backed Trump partly because he was the only candidate talking about illegal immigration, which she said was \"the most important issue in the country.\" Father Frank Pavone, a Roman Catholic priest who directs the Priests for Life organization, is backing Trump because he believes in the sincerity of his anti-abortion rights credentials -- despite doubts among other conservatives on his conversion from a previously pro-abortion rights position. \"No matter what uncertainties there might be about him, there are no uncertainties about where Clinton will go or anyone on the Democratic side on this issue in particular,\" Pavone said. \"A lot of people will come out with the statement that she is as bad as he is, but he is not on this issue particularly,\" said Pavone, who believes that Trump's change of attitude on abortion is \"real and sincere.\" Poll: Trump ahead in deep-red Georgia but Clinton in striking distance Pavone believes that now that Trump is the presumptive nominee and has a realistic chance of becoming President, he will moderate the antics and demeanor that have troubled many conservatives. \"From my own communication with people who have known, and worked with and advised Mr. Trump, I have got nothing but reassurance,\" Pavone said. \"I really think that that principle that the office shapes the man is going to kick in very strongly.\" Perkins suggests that the presumptive nominee could make some tangible moves to bring values voters along with him. One visible step would be to pick a vice presidential nominee who is trusted by evangelical and social conservatives. \"Is there someone that we will have a confidence in that has a track record because past performance in the best indicator of future performance,\" said Perkins. Alternatively, Trump could reassure conservatives by enlisting a trusted member of the community, like Cruz to help vet his judicial nominees \u2014 an intensely acute matter for conservatives, given the open seat that belonged to late Justice Antonin Scalia. In fact, the open Supreme Court seat could emerge as substantial leverage for Trump to corral conservatives behind his campaign given fears in the movement that Clinton could select her own liberal nominee who could sit on the court for decades. Trump may already be heading in that direction. CNN's Dana Bash reported Friday that the billionaire told House leadership officials in a meeting on Thursday that he would produce a list of potential nominees in coordination with the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. But other CNP members are just not ready to make that leap of faith. Kim Bengard, a businesswoman and social conservative activist from California, does not believe that Trump's conversion on abortion is genuine. After swallowing her reservations to side with previous moderate Republican nominees like Bob Dole, John McCain and Mitt Romney, Bengard has hit the end of the line with Trump. \"I can't do it,\" Bengard said, adding that she believes the billionaire's anti-abortion rights position is simply one of convenience. \"I don't believe he is a Republican. He is certainly not a conservative,\" said Bengard. \"I am going to in the end walk away with my convictions intact. I won't vote the top of the ticket, I am sad and horrified about what is ahead of us,\" Bengard said, adding she would restrict herself to down-ticket races in the current election season. Inside \"The Group\" CNP may be the most powerful group whose members you didn't know. As the group explains on its website, which provides no membership information, the CNP \"brings together the country's most influential conservative leaders in business, government, politics, religion, and academia to hear and learn from policy experts on a wide range of issues.\" The membership list is ''strictly confidential,\" a CNP memo obtained by The New York Times in 2004 noted. ''The media should not know when or where we meet or who takes part in our programs, before or after a meeting.\" In 2014 and 2015, several GOP presidential candidates -- Cruz, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, Dr. Ben Carson, Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sen. Rand Paul, and former Sen. Rick Santorum, among others -- spoke with CNP members in the hopes of securing their support. At the end of 2015, conservative activist leaders linked to \"The Group\" voted to support Cruz in the primaries but in February, as reported by the National Review,members of the Group began expressing concerns about Cruz's viability. But the CNP itself says that it does not endorse candidates and does not hold straw polls showing presidential preference. The ranks of members are made up of grassroots conservatives who, according to their Values Statement, \"value the power of collaborative networking among conservative leaders to strengthen the movement and its impact.\" CNN obtained a CNP membership directory from 2014, when Perkins was vice president of the executive committee and the president was Stuart Epperson, co-founder and chairman of Salem Communications. Secretary. Treasurer of the Group was John Scribante, Chief Executive Officer at Orion Energy Systems, Inc. Several former GOP presidential candidates are listed, including Santorum, Gary Bauer, Herman Cain, Steve Forbes and Jim Gilmore. The leaders of key conservative and like-minded groups are also on the roster, such as Citizens United President David Bossie, former Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, Tea Party Express Chairman Amy Kremer, National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre, Club for Growth leader David McIntosh, Judicial Watch President Thomas Fitton, Operation Rescue President Troy Newman, Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, and Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. Other boldfaced names, organizers and donors familiar in the conservative world include: Foster Freiss; Ralph Reed, Bishop E.W. Jackson, Ed Meese, former Reagan-era Energy and Interior secretary Don Hodel, Linda Bean, James Dobson, and Bain Capital Managing Director Louis Bremer. Congresswoman: Trump will fix problems with women voters  Congresswoman: Trump will fix problems with women voters 03:01 And the media world is represented. Listed on the 2014 roster are: Joseph Farah, founder and CEO of WND; Christopher Ruddy, Newsmax founder, CEO and president; and Neil Patel, co-founder of The Daily Caller. The pursuit of the Group's goals is augmented by CNP Action, Inc., a sister organization that \"promotes issues or specific pieces of legislation through regular publications and standing committee workshops,\" according to its website, and is headed by Gary Aldrich, the former FBI Agent whose 1996 book detailed accusations of security breaches at then-President Bill Clinton's White House. The CNP's influence is beyond dispute. Reporter Marc Ambinder noted that shortly after \"candidate George W. Bush spoke before a closed-press CNP session in San Antonio...magisterial conservatives pronounced the allegedly moderate younger Bush fit for the mantle of Republican leadership.\" (Ambinder allowed that the two moments might not have been directly connected.) But while the impact of the CNP is clear, it is less certain that conservatives who have spent decades fighting to insert their ideology at the heart of government will present a united front in the coming fall election. But for those conservatives who are still wavering about endorsing Trump or who might be tempted by a possible third party candidate, Schlafly, who has impeccable conservative credentials after a lifetime on the front-lines of the ideological struggle, has a simple message. \"I remind people we are a two party system. If you like a third party or some other way, you can move to Europe \u2014 You have got to pick one. The fight is in the Republican Party.\"","articles_date":"19 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/bluevirginia.us\/2018\/04\/what-do-nick-freitas-corey-stewart-and-ew-jackson-have-to-hide-from-virginia-gop-voters","articles_title":"What Do Nick Freitas, Corey Stewart and EW Jackson Have to Hide from Virginia GOP Voters?","candidate_fk":10,"first_name":"E.W.","id":5,"last_name":"Jackson","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2,"issue":8},{"article_text":" At the forum for candidates for the 2018 Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate hosted at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy on the Grounds of the University of Virginia on Tuesday, March 27, many (if not most) of the audience members were in their late teens and early twenties. That might be expected on a college campus but it should still be encouraging for candidates and Republican Party officials to see so much interest from young voters.  UVA College Republicans Freitas Stewart JacksonAt the same time, however, it should be worrisome for those same candidates and party officials that the audience was overwhelmingly male, demonstrating (anecdotally, at least) that the GOP faces a gender gap as it challenges incumbent Senator Tim Kaine (D-Richmond) in November and as it defends seven of eleven congressional seats against Democratic opponents.  The debate, moderated by Batten School Dean Allan C. Stam, was delightfully civil. Not only were there no catcalls or demonstrations from the audience, the three candidates \u2014 Delegate Nick Freitas, Bishop E.W. Jackson, and Prince William County Board Chairman Corey Stewart \u2014 treated each other and their listeners with respect. There were few instances of snarky comments from any of the participants and, what\u2019s more, the discussion was entirely policy-focused. There were no questions about character, temperament, reputation, or moral shortcomings aimed at one candidate or another.  The three candidates agreed that there should be reform of marijuana laws, with Stewart suggesting that legal medical marijuana is a partial solution to the opioid crisis \u2014 although his primary solution is to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d at the Mexican border to keep out both illegal drugs and illegal immigrants.  All three expressed dismay at the passage of the omnibus spending bill, which was pushed through Congress by Republican leadership and signed into law by a Republican president. Each warned, at one point or another, that the Social Security system is headed toward collapse and that continued deficit spending and accumulation of debt is a national security issue. (They may be unconsciously echoing Libertarian Senate candidate Matt Waters, who has declared this issue as the centerpiece of his campaign.)  Delegate Freitas repeatedly mentioned his military service \u2014 two tours in Iraq, training South Korean special forces \u2014 as well as his experience in the General Assembly as preparation for the U.S. Senate, noting in particular his bill to reform civil asset forfeiture laws, which, he said, had the support of both the Family Foundation and the ACLU.  Bishop Jackson said his experience as a statewide candidate in 2013, when he was the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, prepared him to challenge Tim Kaine. He praised the United States for making it possible for him, the great-grandson of slaves, to run for the United States Senate, and said that participation in the democratic process should not be limited, whether a citizen is black or white, transgender or gay, rich or poor.  For his part, Chairman Stewart stated he was not campaigning to \u201cmake friends,\u201d asserted that anthropogenic climate change is \u201ca hoax,\u201d and called high-school gun control advocate David Hogg a \u201cpunk.\u201d He said that mayors and other public officials who choose not to cooperate in federal immigration-law enforcement efforts should be prosecuted and jailed.

With fewer than six weeks to go before the June 12 Republican primary that will decide the party\u2019s nominee for the U.S. Senate and the principal challenger to incumbent Senator Tim Kaine, the three candidates for the Virginia GOP\u2019s nomination are criss-crossing the Commonwealth in search of voters, volunteers, and money.  Senate Candidates Nick Freitas Charlottesville headquartersLast weekend in Charlottesville, two of those candidates held public appearances. Delegate Nick Freitas opened up his local campaign headquarters with pizza and soft drinks, attracting a crowd that was about half students from the University of Virginia and half long-time activists and volunteers from Albemarle County and the City of Charlottesville.  I caught up with Delegate Freitas just before he went inside his new headquarters building. I asked him not only about his Senate campaign, but also about the recent General Assembly session, which will reconvene on May 14th to deal with a still-unfinished state budget.  A couple of days after I spoke with Nick Freitas, another candidate for the U.S. Senate nomination came to Charlottesville to deliver a speech on race relations. E.W. Jackson, who was also the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor in 2013, addressed a crowd of between 130 and 150 people that was, ironically \u2013 given the nature of his topic \u2013 about 95 percent white, or Americans of European ancestry. A majority of the audience looked to be older than sixty years of age, as well.  E.W. Jackson Charlottesville DoubletreeBefore his speech, I had some one-on-one time with E.W. Jackson to ask about his campaign, evangelical support for Donald Trump, and how Tim Kaine is vulnerable in November. My first question was about his campaign\u2019s fundraising, which, according to finance reports, is lagging behind his opponents.  Later in the show, E.W. Jackson is featured in our \u201cFrom the Archives\u201d segment. That interview took place almost precisely six years (April 28, 2012) before our most recent chat (April 29, 2018), when Jackson first ran for the U.S. Senate in Virginia.  There\u2019s politics outside Virginia. Not long ago, I had an opportunity to interview the Mayor of Johannesburg, South Africa. While that was a lengthy interview, this brief excerpt has a lot of heft to it. I asked the Mayor how Johannesburg is able to create sufficient employment for the many people who migrate there from the countryside and from nearby countries like Zimbabwe.  General Assembly Delegate Rob Bell represents all of Greene County and parts of Albemarle, Fluvanna, and Rockingham counties. He is one of three Members of the House of Delegates who share the surname \u201cBell.\u201d (The others are Dickie Bell of Staunton and John Bell of Chantilly.) Two Republicans, one Democrat named Bell make up 3 per cent of the House of Delegates. Go figure.  When I ran into him at the opening of the Freitas for Senate campaign headquarters, I asked Delegate Rob Bell about the recent General Assembly session \u2013 or current session, since it reconvenes on May 14 to deal with the budget. Again.  Local History Virginia has a lot of history in it, as you would expect from the state that had the first permanent English colony in North America, dating to the establishment of Jamestown in 1607. Giants of American history have roamed Virginia\u2019s mountains and valleys, including George Washington, Patrick Henry, and the three presidents who came from the Charlottesville area \u2013 Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe.  In the shadow of these national figures is local history \u2013 belonging to the individuals, families, businesses, and civic groups that contribute to the prosperity, politics, and sometimes scandals of our towns, cities, and counties.  I spoke to Will Lyster, who recently became president of the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society and promptly had the bylaws changed so his title is now chairman rather than president. I asked him about the importance of local historical societies like the one he heads up and what we can learn from local history.  At the Movies Film critic Tim Hulsey is back and his review of Avengers: Infinity War is sure to stir up some debate.

One of those deadlines just passed, on April 15, and overwhelmingly, Virginia\u2019s federal (U.S. House and U.S. Senate) candidates managed to get their reports in on time, or at least very close to on time (I\u2019ve been posting the numbers here as I see them).  That is, all the federal candidates managed to do that\u2026with four glaring exceptions: 1) Democrat Charlotte Moore in VA-06, who shows absolutely no 1Q18 (or any other) campaign finance information on the FEC website; 2) Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Nick Freitas; 3) Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Corey Stewart and 4) Republican candidate for U.S. Senate E.W. Jackson, Sr.  What on earth is going on here?  According to the FEC website:  Under the Commission\u2019s mandatory electronic filing regulations, individuals and organizations required to file with the FEC that receive contributions or make expenditures, including independent expenditures, aggregating in excess of $50,000 in a calendar year \u2014 or have reason to expect to do so \u2014 must file all reports and statements electronically.  Reports filed electronically must be received and validated by the Commission by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the filing date. Electronic filers who file on paper or submit an electronic report that does not pass the Commission\u2019s validation program by that time on the filing deadline will be considered nonfilers and may be subject to enforcement actions, including administrative fines.  So that seems clear, right? You have to file by the deadline \u2013 in this case April 15 \u2013 or you can be subject to \u201cenforcement actions.\u201d Except that it gets a bit complicated when it comes to U.S. Senate candidates:  Senate campaigns and other committees supporting Senate candidates must file their FEC reports with the Secretary of the Senate on paper, but may file an additional unofficial electronic copy of their report with the Commission in order to enhance disclosure.  Wait, really? The FEC actually says that U.S. Senate candidates HAVE TO file on PAPER, with only an OPTION to file electronically as well? What, are we back in the 1950s (where Republicans would like to take the country) or something? But yes, believe it or not, this is actually the case in the year 2018, despite what I\u2019m told have been multiple efforts to change that idiotic rule \u2013 none of which have passed. F\u2019ed up, I know. But still, note that there\u2019s absolutely nothing preventing U.S. Senate candidates from also filing electronically. So why wouldn\u2019t they do that in addition to filing on paper? Hmmmm\u2026  Which brings us to the Republican U.S. Senate campaigns of Nick Freitas, Corey Stewart and EW Jackson, none of whom currently show any information for 1Q18 on the FEC website. But before we get to them, though, note that Sen. Tim Kaine\u2019s information was filed on time, as it should have been, and includes detailed, itemized receipt and disbursement information, again as it should! Why this matters is simple: so that the voters can see who the candidates for federal office are receiving their money from and what they are spending that money on. It\u2019s called \u201ctransparency,\u201d aka \u201cgiving voters the information they need to make informed decisions.\u201d  And clearly. Sen. Tim Kaine takes all that seriously, as of course he should. Meanwhile, in stark-but-oh-so-revealing contrast, Republicans Nick Freitas, Corey Stewart and EW Jackson apparently don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s hindquarters if Virginia GOP primary voters are informed, at least not in a timely fashion, regarding where they\u2019re getting their money and what they\u2019re spending it on. Why is that? Do they have things they\u2019d rather Virginia GOP voters not see, at least not in a timely fashion? Are they simply embarrassed at how badly they\u2019re getting blown out of the water by Sen. Tim Kaine? Both?  By the way, even if Nick, Corey and EW filed by paper only, and even if the FEC still hasn\u2019t posted that information, there is absolutely nothing stopping Nick, Corey and EW from putting our press releases with detailed information on their 1Q18 campaign fundraising and expenditures. Yet so far, all we have is a press release from Nick Freitas\u2019 campaign reporting \u201c$343,712 raised and more than $250,000 cash-on-hand,\u201d with \u201c5,373 individual donors, giving an average of $63.97.\u201d Again, no details regarding who those donors might be, or where his money\u2019s going. Still, it\u2019s better than Corey Stewart and EW Jackson, neither of whom has released any information whatsoever about their 1Q18 campaign finances, now four days after the April 15 filing deadline.  In sum, it appears that none of the three Virginia Republican U.S. Senate candidates \u2013 Nick Freitas, Corey Stewart and EW Jackson \u2013 care very much whether or not GOP primary voters have the information they need to make informed choices regarding who to support. In stark contrast, Sen. Tim Kaine actually respects voters (what a concept!), as well as the law, and has done exactly what he should have done. I guess it\u2019s not surprising that the contrast between Kaine and his far-right\/extreme opponents is so stark \u2013 on this and on everything else. Something to keep in mind as we move into the general election between Kaine and one of these clowns\u2026  P.S. As for Charlotte Moore in VA-06, who the hell knows what\u2019s going on there? Very strange.","articles_date":"4 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.citypages.com\/news\/duluths-confederate-yankee-corey-stewart-rides-again-in-virginia-senate-race\/481653241","articles_title":"Corey Stewart rides again in Virginia Senate race","candidate_fk":10,"first_name":"E.W.","id":5,"last_name":"Jackson","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2,"issue":8},{"article_text":"Virginia Republican Corey Stewart is accusing GOP leaders of favoring a rival for the nomination to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., despite the party's claim of neutrality in the June 12 primary.  Stewart, the bombastic chairman of the Prince William Board of Supervisors, said party leaders secretly back Nick Freitas, a two-term state lawmaker from the Piedmont Valley - a charge the state GOP denied.  \"He's a stooge for the establishment,\" Stewart said during a 10-minute-long news conference outside the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee Thursday afternoon. \"They're trying to use him to keep my name off the [general election] ballot.\"  In addition to Freitas, Stewart is also competing with E.W. Jackson, a Chesapeake minister. All three men are Trump admirers.  But Stewart has portrayed himself as an anti-establishment candidate and the only person who can turn out Trump voters in November.  \"You've got the Republican establishment essentially colluding with the Democratic establishment to keep Trump supporters off the ballot in November,\" Stewart said, noting a Washington Post story from December that described the NRSC's efforts to find an alternative candidate to Stewart, who launched his campaign last July.  The NRSC did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.  Virginia GOP Chairman John Whitbeck said the party treats all primary candidates the same. \"To quote President Trump, 'There is no collusion. Total witch hunt',\" he said.  Stewart's recent line of attack comes two days after Senate GOP hopeful Ivan Raiklin filed a lawsuit disputing the party's finding that he did not collect enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. He also said Whitbeck encouraged Raiklin to support Freitas.  Whitbeck called the claim \"fake news.\"  \"Because of the pending lawsuit we can't go into details at this point,\" Whitbeck said, \"however the quickest way to get attention is to attack your own party. This is a tactic many disgruntled Republicans use to get media attention.\"  Raiklin said Thursday he didn't think the party was stacking the deck in favor of Freitas.  \"In my eight months of doing this as a political newcomer,\" Raiklin said, \"I give everyone the benefit of the doubt and I don't see that.\"  Freitas said he enjoys more support from Virginia Republicans than Stewart because he is opposed to tax hikes. He noted the Prince William Board of Supervisors, which Stewart chairs, approved average tax increase of 4.5 percent in 2014.  \"It's no surprise or conspiracy that Virginia Republican voters want a candidate who has not raised taxes on their constituents,\" Freitas said in a statement. \"Corey is exploiting Ivan Raiklin for his own political expedience, much like he did during the presidential race.\"  Stewart took a similar position in his unsuccessful campaign for the GOP nomination for governor against Ed Gillespie last year and during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he protested oustide the Republican National Committee headquarters and warned the national party against abandoning Trump. Hours later, Stewart was booted as chairman of Trump's Virginia campaign.  Jackson said he does not believe the state GOP is giving preferential treatment to any of the primary candidates.  \"However,\" Jackson said, \"anyone can see a lot of the politicians are lining up behind Nick. I'm not worried about that. I think a lot of people are tired of politicians, of being told how to vote... All of that is precisely what has the average voter incensed.\"  Freitas has been endorsed by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., former Governor Robert McDonnell and Morton Blackwell, one of two of Virginia's representatives on the Republican National Committee, as well as many of his colleagues in the legislature.  He made a controversial speech in defense of the Second Amendment on the floor of the General Assembly weeks after the Parkland school shooting, raising his profile somewhat and helping him surpass Stewart and Jackson in fundraising by the end of March with $251,694 cash on hand.  The war chest is a tiny fraction of the $16 million Kaine has amassed in his campaign for a second term.","articles_date":"1 5 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/pilotonline.com\/news\/government\/politics\/article_9ae48616-4a06-5f81-acf5-e1ee7501bbc5.html","articles_title":"Virginia Republican Senate candidates repeatedly attack Obama, barely mention Kaine","candidate_fk":10,"first_name":"E.W.","id":5,"last_name":"Jackson","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2,"issue":8},{"article_text":"GOP Senate candidate Corey Stewart complained at a news conference in Washington on Thursday that Republican leaders were trying to stop him from winning the nomination in the three-way primary.  He cited as evidence some facts from a federal lawsuit over ballot access that longshot former GOP candidate Ivan Raiklin filed Tuesday against the Republican Party of Virginia and the commonwealth.  \u201cHe says that party leaders approached him and said that they wanted him to drop out and support my opponent Nick Freitas,\u201d Stewart said at a news conference outside the offices of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Freitas, a state lawmaker from Culpeper, and minister E.W. Jackson of Chesapeake are vying with Stewart in the June 12 primary for the chance to face Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.  Raiklin said in an interview Thursday that Stewart\u2019s description of the lawsuit was \u201cfairly accurate\u201d but \u201csomewhat of a stretch.\u201d  \u201cNo, he never said drop out,\u201d Raiklin said of a conversation he had with state GOP Chairman John Whitbeck.  But Raiklin said he did get a sense during a March 29 phone call with Whitbeck that the party chairman favored Freitas. \u201cThat\u2019s how I received it, absolutely,\u201d Raiklin said.  Raiklin\u2019s lawsuit, filed in federal court, alleges that the state GOP illegally made errors in the process for certifying whether he obtained enough voter signatures to get on the primary ballot. He also alleges that the Virginia Department of Elections should have heard his appeal and challenges the constitutionality of a state law related to verifying valid signatures.  A statement of facts in Raiklin\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Whitbeck called Raiklin on March 29 to tell him he didn\u2019t make the ballot, and \u201curged Raiklin that his next call after hanging up with Whitbeck should be to Delegate Nick Freitas.\u201d  Stewart\u2019s camp has seized on that as evidence that Whitbeck tried to pressure Raiklin, a former Green Beret in the Army, into endorsing Freitas.  Raiklin said he told Whitbeck during the call he was disappointed the party didn\u2019t certify him for the ballot. During the discussion, Whitbeck asked him if he supported any of the other candidates, and Raiklin said he would be in favor of a Green Beret, meaning Freitas, who is also a Green Beret. And it was after that, Raiklin said, that Whitbeck said he should call Freitas to offer support.  In hindsight, Raiklin said, he wishes he would have not included information about his call with Whitbeck in the lawsuit because \u201cthat is not my focus.\u201d  The point of his lawsuit, he said, is to educate people about flaws in the process and how the party has final say in who gets on a primary ballot.  The Republican Party of Virginia issued a statement Tuesday saying \u201cno such conversation happened.\u201d The party declined further comment Thursday on the call. Raiklin will livestream a statement addressing his dispute with the party at 10 a.m. Friday from James Madison\u2019s Montpelier in Orange County.  As far as other evidence that the Republican establishment was trying to stop him, Stewart cited an anonymous source in a Dec. 7 Washington Post story who was described as being \u201cfamiliar with the thinking at the NRSC,\u201d the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  The source said national party leaders say, \u201cWe don\u2019t care if we can beat Kaine or not. [Stewart is] an embarrassment,\u201d according to the story.  Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, has been running longer than Freitas and Jackson, having announced his run about a month after narrowly losing to Ed Gillespie in the 2017 GOP primary for governor.","articles_date":"5 12 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/virginia-politics\/ew-jackson-conservative-firebrand-preparing-us-senate-bid-in-virginia\/2017\/12\/05\/ddccfdc6-d9e1-11e7-b859-fb0995360725_story.html?utm_term=.f0baea99c11d","articles_title":"E.W.

He\u2019s also a neo-Confederate -- a kind of ideology that lives in a Stranger Things Upside Down where the Civil War is referred to as \u201cThe War of Northern Aggression,\u201d Confederate General Stonewall Jackson was a \u201cgood and honorable and noble man,\u201d and southerners fought for states\u2019 rights rather than slavery.  It\u2019s the kind of mindset that has one attending \u201cOld South\u201d themed galas, defending Confederate monuments, and using the word \u201cYankee\u201d as a slur. Though, as a Duluth native, he is, technically, a Yankee. But still.  Apparently it\u2019s been working out for him. Last year, Stewart almost bagged the Republican gubernatorial nomination, even as his openness about being a Confederate flaghead earned him condemnations from his own party -- and his fellow Prince William County supervisors. He managed to come within one percentage point of his primary rival, Ed Gillespie.  He still managed to get further than anyone thought he would. The near miss was chalked up to another example of the anti-establishment politics that analysts attribute to the rise of Trump. It was around that time that he started floating the idea of running against Virginia\u2019s Democratic senator, Tim Kaine.  That\u2019s just what he did, and his hyper conservative politics are going gangbusters. He\u2019s considered the GOP frontrunner in the Virginia Senate race. There\u2019s less mention now of the Confederacy, but Stewart is still operating on an \u201cus vs. them\u201d basis with himself positioned \u201cwith President Trump,\u201d opposing \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d \u201cillegal immigration,\u201d and the \u201cWashington elites,\u201d according to his website.  And the language of his campaign remains\u2026 colorful.  His two main populist planks appear to be gun rights...  Although among his more recent targets seem to be the invading scourge that is girls joining the Boy Scouts.  He\u2019s not shying away from the fact that he\u2019s originally from Minnesota. That\u2019s all in his campaign bio, with descriptions of his \u201cworking class family\u201d and growing up a longshoreman\u2019s son.  A survey of Republican voters taken by Christopher Newport University in early March marked him as a nose ahead of fellow Republicans Nick Freitas and E. W. Jackson. That may not be saying much, because 66 percent of the respondents said they hadn\u2019t decided on a candidate yet.  Noel Fritsch, a spokesperson for Stewart's campaign, says that defending Confederate monuments its still very much a part of Stewart's platform.  \"The issue is really rule of law,\" he says. \"That's what it comes down to.\"","articles_date":"19 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/virginia-politics\/va-legislator-freitas-raises-nearly-350000-in-bid-to-take-on-tim-kaine\/2018\/04\/19\/dafec5ce-4373-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html?utm_term=.dcf1fecfe6c3","articles_title":"Virginia legislator Freitas raises nearly $350,000 in bid to take on Tim Kaine","candidate_fk":10,"first_name":"E.W.","id":5,"last_name":"Jackson","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2,"issue":8},{"article_text":"Nick Freitas and E.W. Jackson, two of three Republicans seeking the party\u2019s nod to run against U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in November, barely mentioned the Democrat in their debate Monday night, but repeatedly berated former President Barack Obama, who left office 15 months ago.  In responding to a moderator\u2019s questions in front of about 75 Republicans at dinner in The Town Center Club, the candidates expressed similar views on the nation\u2019s overseas wars, tax policy, health care and immigration. Both also praised President Donald Trump, arguing that he has projected a stronger brand of leadership during his first year than Obama did in eight years in the White House.  Freitas, a state delegate from Culpeper County, said he first became interested in a political career while an Army Green Beret serving his second tour in Iraq in 2008, when he learned Obama had been elected president. Freitas said he was \u201creally confused\u201d and felt it was wrong that Americans chose \u201ca philosophy which was trying to convince them that just handing a little bit more power over to the government, a little bit more freedom, a little bit more of their choices \u2013 that the government would take care of them.\u201d  Jackson, a Chesapeake minister who served in the Marines in the 1970s, contended Obama disliked the armed services: \u201cFor eight years, we kind of all knew that the president didn\u2019t really care about the military. They were kind of side note. We\u2019ve got a president now who genuinely loves our military.\u201d  The third candidate in the June 12 GOP statewide primary, Prince William County Board Chairman Corey Stewart, did not attend the event sponsored by the Republican Professionals Network.  Freitas and Jackson also leveled scorn at the Affordable Care Act, which is considered one of Obama\u2019s major accomplishments. Freitas called it a \u201ccancer\u201d that was designed to fail so that its supporters could replace it with a national government health care system. He and Jackson want to abolish what remains of the law, known as Obamacare. They said a competitive, market-based health care system will lead to lower prices and better services.  Both candidates opposed the Obama Administration\u2019s Iran nuclear agreement that delayed the country\u2019s development of nuclear weapons and praised Trump for threatening to quash it. The Republican president is taking a more aggressive stance against Iran and North Korea that will get results, the candidates said.  Jackson said Trump\u2019s tweets insulting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un by calling him \u201crocket man\u201d show Trump is a \u201cmasterful negotiator\u201d because Kim now wants to negotiate.  The candidates supported Trump\u2019s plans for tighter immigration controls, including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. They praised the recent tax overhaul law passed by the Republican-controlled Congress.  Freitas said the tax changes don\u2019t go far enough. He favors abolishing the federal income tax entirely, replacing it with a national sales tax \u2013 known by supporters as a \u201cfair tax.\u201d  Although Kaine was never mentioned, both Republicans agreed with the incumbent\u2019s long-standing view that Congress has wrongly avoided debating and voting on the long-term use of military forces overseas.  Jackson and Freitas, who both want the United States to withdraw almost all its troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, said they supported Trump\u2019s launching of airstrikes against Syria in response to that country\u2019s use of chemical weapons on its civilians. But they argued the president shouldn\u2019t be able to commit troops to long-term conflicts without congressional action.  Freitas said Congress cannot be allowed to \u201ccompletely abrogate its responsibility and simply say when the war\u2019s popular \u2018We got your back,\u2019 and as soon as the war is not popular, \u2018It\u2019s on you Mr. President.\u2019 ... I do not think it\u2019s too much to ask that our men and women in Congress display an ounce of the courage that they expect of our men and women when they send them into harm\u2019s way.\u201d  Kaine has made a similar argument for years. He and a handful of other senators have said the congressional approval for the use of military force following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks has been misused to conduct combat operations against unrelated foes and nations. They want Congress to debate and vote on a new authorization of military force.","articles_date":"1 5 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/bluevirginia.us\/2018\/05\/ew-jackson-claims-video-it-was-not-europeans-who-came-up-with-racial-ideology-it-was-arab-muslims","articles_title":"Video: EW Jackson Claims 'It was NOT Europeans who came up with racial ideology, it was Arab Muslims'","candidate_fk":10,"first_name":"E.W.","id":5,"last_name":"Jackson","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2,"issue":6},{"article_text":"ALEXANDRIA, Va., May 4, 2018 \/Standard Newswire\/ -- Libertarian nominee for US Senate, Matt Waters, voiced his support for GOP Candidate Ivan Raiklin's lawsuit against John Findlay, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia, and others.

Along with the still-to-be-chosen Republican nominee, Waters will challenge incumbent Senator Tim Kaine.  A native Virginian whose roots go back to the original settlers at Jamestown on one side of his family, he is also the grandson of recent immigrants from Central Europe. Raised in Hampton Roads, he earned his undergraduate degree at George Mason University. Professionally, he has worked as a fundraising consultant for political causes and non-profit organizations.  In his speech to the LPVA delegates and in an interview with Bearing Drift (listen for it next week on The Score), Waters emphasized that his highest concern is the national debt, which he views as unsustainable. Citing a report from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he said the debt is the biggest national security threat to the United States, greater than ISIS or Russia or China.   Waters describes himself as a pro-life Libertarian (\u201ccard-carrying\u201d since 2008, he says) and a firm supporter of the Second Amendment \u2014 he takes a concealed weapon with him wherever he goes. He is also a home-schooling father of five children.  Like other statewide candidates, Waters must collect a minimum of 10,000 valid signatures of registered voters from across the Commonwealth, including 400 signatures from each of Virginia\u2019s eleven congressional delegates, to qualify to have his name on the November general election ballot. The deadline for submitting those petitions to the State Board of Elections is 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, June 12, the same day that the GOP will choose its standard-bearer for the U.S. Senate race.  Like Cliff Hyra, who ran for governor in 2017, and Robert Sarvis, who ran for governor in 2013 and the U.S. Senate in 2014, one of Waters\u2019 goals is to reach the high threshold of 10 percent of the popular vote necessary to qualify the Libertarian Party of Virginia as a major party alongside the Democrats and Republicans. This would alleviate the substantial burden of ballot-access efforts that drains the party\u2019s treasury every time it seeks to run statewide candidates. Related to that, Waters also said he wants to improve the party\u2019s fundraising capacity and build lists of donors and volunteers to help future candidates.  In addition to nominating Waters, the LPVA convention elected party officers and delegates to the party\u2019s midterm national convention in New Orleans. LP members also heard from three of its nominees for the U.S. House of Representatives: Pete Wells, who is challenging incumbent Democrat Donald McEachin in the Fourth Congressional District; Joe Walton, who is running in the Seventh Congressional District against incumbent Republican Dave Brat; and Stevan Porter, who will face off against incumbent Democrat Gerry Connolly in the Eleventh District.  Like Senate candidate Matt Waters, the nominees for the U.S. House must submit petitions due on the same day as the June primary. They each must collect a minimum of 1,000 signatures of registered voters from within their districts.","articles_date":"11 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/bearingdrift.com\/2018\/03\/11\/virginia-libertarians-nominate-candidate-u-s-senate\/","articles_title":"Virginia Libertarians Nominate Candidate for U.S. Senate","candidate_fk":13,"first_name":"Matt","id":6,"last_name":"Waters","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2,"issue":8},{"article_text":"And in other news largely ignored by Virginia media over the weekend\u2026 The Libertarian Party of Virginia nominated Matt Waters, an Alexandria fund-raising consultant, as its candidate for U.S. Senate. Waters will run against Democratic Senator Tim Kaine and whoever wins the Republican Party free-for-all.  In his speech to LPVA delegates, Waters said his biggest concern is the unsustainable national debt. He characterized the $21 trillion debt as the United States\u2019 biggest national security threat, greater than ISIS or China, and he called for an end to the failed war on drugs, the war on terror, and the war on poverty.  Vowing to campaign under the Virginia flag, the motto of which is, \u201cThus always to tyrants,\u201d Waters said:  My campaign will call fellow Virginians to remember who we are, and why we fight. The tyrant today is not the king of England. It is our $21 trillion debt. The tyrant is a massive welfare-warfare state funded by the Federal Reserve that is completely unaccountable, unauditable, and 100 percent  responsible for killing the value of every single dollar we earn in this room. The tyrant is invasive. The tyrant is corrupt. The tyrant is bankrupting this country. \u2026 The tyrant invades pulpits, businesses, families, laptops, and smart phones.

Beyond that, he faces the perennial Libertarian Party obstacle of gaining media recognition. Libertarians\u2019 traditionally low vote percentages make it difficult for candidates to get reporters to take them seriously.  One outside factor might help Waters. The Republican Party of Virginia seems to be in the process of imploding. Mini-Trump candidate Corey Stewart seems best positioned to capture the Republican party nomination, although his victory is far from certain given the number of other candidates also vying for the honor. If Stewart is nominated, he is so polarizing that he will drive many mainstream Republicans out of the party. While Kaine is widely regarded as a genuinely decent guy, he is a cog in a Democratic Party machine that is tilting farther Left every day. Homeless Republicans may well seek refuge with the Libertarian Party.","articles_date":"12 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/baconsrebellion.com\/42374-2\/","articles_title":"Yes, Virginia, There Still Is a Libertarian Party","candidate_fk":13,"first_name":"Matt","id":6,"last_name":"Waters","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2,"issue":8},{"article_text":" At the forum for candidates for the 2018 Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate hosted at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy on the Grounds of the University of Virginia on Tuesday, March 27, many (if not most) of the audience members were in their late teens and early twenties. That might be expected on a college campus but it should still be encouraging for candidates and Republican Party officials to see so much interest from young voters.  UVA College Republicans Freitas Stewart JacksonAt the same time, however, it should be worrisome for those same candidates and party officials that the audience was overwhelmingly male, demonstrating (anecdotally, at least) that the GOP faces a gender gap as it challenges incumbent Senator Tim Kaine (D-Richmond) in November and as it defends seven of eleven congressional seats against Democratic opponents.  The debate, moderated by Batten School Dean Allan C. Stam, was delightfully civil. Not only were there no catcalls or demonstrations from the audience, the three candidates \u2014 Delegate Nick Freitas, Bishop E.W. Jackson, and Prince William County Board Chairman Corey Stewart \u2014 treated each other and their listeners with respect. There were few instances of snarky comments from any of the participants and, what\u2019s more, the discussion was entirely policy-focused. There were no questions about character, temperament, reputation, or moral shortcomings aimed at one candidate or another.  The three candidates agreed that there should be reform of marijuana laws, with Stewart suggesting that legal medical marijuana is a partial solution to the opioid crisis \u2014 although his primary solution is to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d at the Mexican border to keep out both illegal drugs and illegal immigrants.  All three expressed dismay at the passage of the omnibus spending bill, which was pushed through Congress by Republican leadership and signed into law by a Republican president. Each warned, at one point or another, that the Social Security system is headed toward collapse and that continued deficit spending and accumulation of debt is a national security issue. (They may be unconsciously echoing Libertarian Senate candidate Matt Waters, who has declared this issue as the centerpiece of his campaign.)  Delegate Freitas repeatedly mentioned his military service \u2014 two tours in Iraq, training South Korean special forces \u2014 as well as his experience in the General Assembly as preparation for the U.S. Senate, noting in particular his bill to reform civil asset forfeiture laws, which, he said, had the support of both the Family Foundation and the ACLU.  Bishop Jackson said his experience as a statewide candidate in 2013, when he was the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, prepared him to challenge Tim Kaine. He praised the United States for making it possible for him, the great-grandson of slaves, to run for the United States Senate, and said that participation in the democratic process should not be limited, whether a citizen is black or white, transgender or gay, rich or poor.  For his part, Chairman Stewart stated he was not campaigning to \u201cmake friends,\u201d asserted that anthropogenic climate change is \u201ca hoax,\u201d and called high-school gun control advocate David Hogg a \u201cpunk.\u201d He said that mayors and other public officials who choose not to cooperate in federal immigration-law enforcement efforts should be prosecuted and jailed.

The theme of Kaine\u2019s re-election campaign is \u201ca Virginia that works for all.\u201d  Kaine said that means jobs, education, health care, security and equality for all.   \u201cI\u2019m running again because I want to keep building a Virginia that works for all, and I\u2019m really proud of what Virginia is doing, and I\u2019m inspired by the Virginians I meet every day,\u201d Kaine said in an interview following his remarks at the campaign rally that was attended by roughly 100 people.  At CVCC, Kaine touched upon the need to create jobs in infrastructure and renewable energy.  \u201cI think infrastructure is a huge opportunity because the president wants to do infrastructure,\u201d Kaine said.  He added the U.S. needs to invest in infrastructure rather than start trade wars that \u201ccould potentially hurt American workers,\u201d a swipe at President Donald Trump\u2019s call for tariffs on certain Chinese products.  Kaine also said with infrastructure comes a need for workforce development.  \u201cIf we do infrastructure, there will be a real burden on the shoulders of our educational institutions,\u201d Kaine said, noting career and technical programs will be asked to fill that need.  \u201cThe most important thing to economic development is ultimately the talent of the workforce.\u201d  Nat Marshall, a CVCC Local Board member who introduced Kaine and spoke briefly about workforce development, said schools need to encourage career exploration at the sixth-grade level to open students\u2019 eyes to opportunities in vocational fields they otherwise may overlook as options.  Marshall said CVCC has a place in helping train a workforce to meet the goals Kaine outlined.  \u201cCommunity colleges are the most flexible institutions that can do that,\u201d Marshall said.  In his address to constituents, Kaine also said the U.S. needs to raise the minimum wage over time.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the country should work full time, have a dependent and be below the poverty line,\u201d the senator said, drawing applause from a friendly crowd wearing Kaine 2018 stickers.  Though Kaine\u2019s opening address stuck to his campaign planks, questions from the crowd varied.  Kate Staton, 15, a sophomore at E.C. Glass High School, asked Kaine about gun violence and why it has taken national student walkouts to prompt a dialogue about fatal shootings across the country.  \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t, but I\u2019m so proud of you guys, I really am,\u201d Kaine answered.  He said as a former mayor of Richmond, former governor of Virginia and as a senator, he has called for \u201cmore commonsense rules about gun safety,\u201d pushing for background checks, assault weapons bans, limitations on high-capacity magazines and stricter regulations on purchasing firearms at gun shows.  \u201cMy plea to you is keep doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Kaine told Staton.  He added he has grown despondent over the lack of congressional action to prevent gun violence.  \u201cWe the students simply don\u2019t feel safe going to school,\u201d Staton said in an interview.  She added she appreciated the efforts the senator has made but wants immediate action.  Kaine also fielded a question about cyber threats and malicious companies sharing personal data.  In response, Kaine said the U.S. needs more cybersecurity professionals, and there should be consequences for companies that allow private user data to fall in the hand of malicious actors.  One constituent asked if there was a congressional answer the rise of misinformation and political polarization, noting members of her own family were divided over the Trump presidency.  Kaine said the answer isn\u2019t censoring content but pushing critical thinking in schools.  He added he has major concerns about Trump, saying the president divides Americans rather than uniting them and undercuts diplomacy with his tweets and turnover in the administration.  The senator added he plans to campaign on what he hopes to accomplish in another term, rather than focusing on the issues he has with Trump\u2019s leadership and the Republican Party.  \u201cFundamentally, my campaign is going to be about a Virginia that works for all,\u201d Kaine said.  Kaine\u2019s stop at CVCC was part of an eight-day campaign kickoff across the commonwealth. Thursday was the fourth day.  Kaine was elected to his first term as a U.S. senator in 2012 after serving as Virginia\u2019s  governor from 2006 to 2010.

It was a tough one, and the questioner, a woman with long gray hair, seemed to know it, as she sat awaiting her answer.  Willis, a Special Forces officer in the West Virginia National Guard, now running for Senate as a Republican, may be a novice politician, but he\u2019s savvy enough to know better than to pick sides in a war that ended more than a century ago. He also knows his West Virginia history. The state came into being in the first place by seceding from the Commonwealth of Virginia due to residents\u2019 Union sympathies.  For a second, he appeared to be cornered. He\u2019d studied the opioid crisis, energy policy, immigration, and jobs. Somehow the Civil War hadn\u2019t come up.  But after four months on the trail, Willis, who is good looking and athletic, and wears his graying hair cropped short, has developed a seasoned politician\u2019s knack for slipping out of a trap. \u201cI was born on the right side of the Mason Dixon,\u201d he said with a smile \u2014 offering an answer that left plenty of room for interpretation. (He was born in Virginia.) In other words, a politician\u2019s answer. While his audience pondered his response, Willis quickly dove into his stump speech.  Tom Willis west virginia senate It was a cold, gray day in April, and only a handful of Fayette County Republicans had shown up for what was already Willis\u2019 second campaign speech of the day. As he always did, he touched on the state\u2019s loss of jobs and the opioid crisis. On a personal note, he talked about his own quest to serve, how he lost his first wife to cancer and how his son later survived the disease.  \u201cI understand what it is like to suffer,\u201d he said to nods from the group. \u201cWe have problems, but the problems can be solved if we work together.\u201d  After Willis finished, an older man wearing a maroon Virginia Tech shirt and jeans, his arm in a gray sling, stood up and saluted him. A former Army Ranger, the man wouldn\u2019t let the Civil War question go.  \u201cAre you a good Confederate or a damn Yankee?\u201d  \u201cMartinsville, Virginia, is rebel country,\u201d Willis said. \u201cYou heard of it? We\u2019ve got a speedway.\u201d  The answer brought a smile to the man\u2019s face. Then a nod of the head. A connection made even as Willis once again deftly sidestepped the issue.  Maybe he could win this thing after all\u2026  tom willis west virginia senate Year of the veteran? A career in the military has long been seen as a stepping stone to elective office, but the 2018 midterms are shaping up to be a special moment for veterans storming the political battlespace.  Serving in the military is the \u201csingle best-testing trait\u201d for congressional candidates, and voters from both parties\u2019 view those who served in a positive light, according to a recent poll conducted by a veteran\u2019s super PAC.  With Honor, a \u201ccross-partisan\u201d PAC helping veterans get elected to Congress, surveyed 753 likely voters nationwide, and the results suggest that a background in the armed forces makes candidates like Willis uniquely suited for today\u2019s hyperpartisan political environment. Nearly a third of voters across the political spectrum say they are willing to cross party lines to vote for a veteran. Moreover, former service members are viewed as mission-oriented coalition builders who can work across the aisle.  As Willis is discovering, even a veteran can find it hard to break through, though \u2014 especially in a crowded field. On the Republican side, six candidates have been jockeying for the chance to replace Democrat Joe Manchin, who is running for his second full term. To the extent that the media has taken note of the race, most of the attention has been focused on the campaign of Don Blankenship, the former coal company CEO who recently emerged from a prison stint in connection with the 2010 disaster at a mine he operated that left 29 miners dead.  In a normal election year, a backstory like that would be seen as disqualifying. Not this year. In a recent poll, Blankenship drew 12 percent of likely voters to just 3 percent who picked Willis. Frontrunners State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins came in at 24 percent and 20 percent respectively. With the primary just a week away, however, 39 percent of GOP voters were undecided \u2014 a thin sliver of hope for Willis.  tom Willis west virginia senate Meanwhile, Willis says his own internal polling has him tied for third place with Morrisey. And voters who get to hear about his veteran status seem to be responding. Among them, he wins with 36 percent of the vote, according to internal polling data.  \u201cI just look at it as a military operation to win hearts and minds,\u201d Willis says.  In this respect, it turns out, Willis\u2019s special forces training translates well to the campaign trail. Knowing how to quickly build rapport, forge connections, broker deals and appeal to various constituencies may be as important to any counterinsurgency operation \u2014 arguably more so \u2014 than engaging the enemy. And during a few days Task & Purpose spent embedded on the campaign trail with Willis, it was clear that such skills constituted a secret weapon of sorts.  \u201cNobody in the military can build rapport better,\u201d Willis said of the Special Forces. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do for our country under difficult circumstances. Politics is one handshake at a time.\u201d  That\u2019s not the only way that the campaign trail can sometimes resemble a deployment. The mornings are early. The nights are late. The food is unhealthy. And there remains, whatever comes, a singular focus on the mission.  \u201cThere is work to do,\u201d Willis said over and over again. \u201cPeople are suffering. People are unemployed. To be part of the solution, you have a moral responsibility to step up.\u201d  Tom Willis west virginia senate Veteran. Lawyer. Businessman. Willis\u2019s campaign started in January, two months after he left active duty. He was seven years from retirement, but he said he felt called to elective office.  \u201cThe reason I\u2019m running is to serve God by serving my fellow man,\u201d he told me. \u201cI got to a point in my life where I\u2019m not as young as I used to be. But how can I best serve my fellow man? I can serve better by moving from the physical battle to the ideological battle.\u201d  Meanwhile, although West Virginia has one of the biggest veteran populations in the country, there is currently no veteran serving in its Congressional delegation.  \u201cThat\u2019s an anomaly we plan to correct,\u201d Willis said.  A Special Forces Distinguished Honor Graduate, Willis joined the West Virginia National Guard in 2000, starting out in the enlisted ranks and eventually becoming executive officer of a U.S. Army Special Forces Battalion. He deployed to Afghanistan, Macedonia, Peru and Bahrain. He often served as a liaison, working closely with the Peruvian military on counter-narcotics operations and with the Kuwaiti military fighting ISIS.  Before enlisting, Willis \u2014 a graduate of the University of Virginia and Georgetown Law School \u2014 clerked for a federal judge at the U.S. Tax Court and spent some time working as a tax attorney. Now a real estate developer, he is the co-owner of the Glen Ferris Inn on the banks of the Kanawha River in Fayette County.  Willis has consciously built his campaign less on his policy ideas, which tend to follow the typical conservative program, than on his biography. On his campaign website, his varied roles (\u201cVeteran, Businessman, Father\u201d) are featured prominently, and one has to dig a little to learn his stances on the issues. Interestingly, the Republican party does not appear to be mentioned at all, although Willis does compare himself to President Donald Trump (\u201ca fellow outsider\u201d) and promise to be \u201cthe biggest supporter of the President\u2019s agenda to grow our economy, keep taxes low, and restore law and order to our immigration system.\u201d  He bills himself as a soldier first and foremost, driven to serve by a sense of duty. \u201cYou look around and see things and they\u2019re not right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have some major needs in our country and it is going to take some people with integrity.\u201d  \u2018I think he\u2019ll win\u2019 Willis dresses like a lawyer these days. Dark suit. Vest. Leather shoes. Power tie. Riding in his black Jeep Cherokee one morning, with his campaign manager, Jim Shaffer, riding shotgun, he joked that it was his new uniform.  Tom Willis west virginia senate Headed for their first campaign stop of the day, a senior center near Charleston, the men called campaign workers, drafted talking points and sometimes rode in silence. XM\u2019s Chill satellite radio station \u2014 a \u201crelaxing mix of down-tempo EDM and rock\u201d \u2014 provided the soundtrack as Willis weaved through the hills.  West Virginia is the third poorest state in the union, and its challenges seemed to be etched in its landscape. Riding with Willis between campaign stops, it was impossible to miss the crumbling houses, the potted roads and boarded up storefronts. But just as one began to find West Virginia\u2019s plight overwhelming, the Cherokee rounded a bend and cruised past a massive gorge carved by a majestic river.  Willis is aware of the struggles his state faces. At several stops, he mentioned its \u201cbrain drain,\u201d the tendency of residents to leave in search of better economic opportunities. The state has experienced a population decline for several years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  Despite a pro-labor tradition that goes back decades, the basis for a successful teacher\u2019s strike that concluded in March, West Virginia is undoubtedly Trump country. The President won the state by 42 points in the 2016 election. Willis supports Trump because he says the administration has been good to West Virginia and coal, but his support isn\u2019t unconditional.  \u201cI only gave a blank check to the people of West Virginia when I raised my right hand to join the National Guard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll give the people a blank check as a statesman.\u201d  He\u2019ll oppose any policies that hurt West Virginia, he insisted.  Willis pulled his SUV into the parking lot of the Hometown Senior Center,  a squat white building near some railroad tracks, shortly before the day\u2019s event was set to begin \u2014 a forum where local voters could meet candidates for local, state and national office. Inside, it resembled a living room adorned with a fireplace and red, white and blue decorations. Several round tables had been set up in the dining area. The smell of chicken-fried steak, mashed potatoes and green beans wafted into the room from the kitchen.  Tom Willis west virginia senate Two of Willis\u2019 opponents and a few Congressional hopefuls had shown up, as well as some down-ballot candidates. As for voters, they were outnumbered by political hopefuls two to one. The host began with a request to keep speeches to five minutes and to refrain from negative comments about political rivals.  Candidates for the U.S. Senate race were up first. Copley, a bald man with a neatly trimmed beard, took the floor. He is best known for the viral video of him challenging Hillary Clinton about coal jobs at a roundtable during the 2016 presidential campaign, and he used his time to tell that story, ending with an appeal for support.  \u201cI\u2019m not a politician,\u201d Copley emphasized. \u201cI\u2019m a West Virginian.\u201d  Meanwhile, Willis was observing the room. He picked out an African-American woman and an older man in the back as the influencers to focus on when the time came. He started his speech talking about how the partners at Baker & McKenzie, the major law firm he\u2019d worked at, reacted to his choice to join the West Virginia National Guard. His colleagues didn\u2019t understand why he wanted to forgo a career as a tax attorney to try and earn the Special Forces tab, he said, and only one seemed to share the need to serve something bigger than themselves.  The audience watched him closely, fixing their eyes on his smile and hands, which weaved through the air like an orchestra conductor\u2019s.  Tom Willis west virginia senate Willis\u2019s speech focused mostly on his service overseas, with a special emphasis on fighting ISIS, the Taliban and narco-terrorists. But to those gathered in the center, the wars felt far away. Willis knew it. So, he ended his by talking about with the Glen Ferris Inn, his historic hotel, and a state landmark.  \u201cMaybe some of you guys have come in and tried our peanut butter pie?\u201d Willis asked, eliciting nods from the sparse crowd and bringing home his local bona fides.  With only a minutes left, Willis hit the issues, letting voters know he was pro-life and pro-Second Amendment, and pledging to keep the promise of Social Security and Medicare.  \u201cMy name is Tom Willis and I hope you vote for me on May 8,\u201d he said before taking a seat.  Navy veteran turned truck driver Jack Newbrough was next.  Instead of a suit jacket, Newbrough sported a sweatshirt, along with work boots, a USS West Virginia baseball cap and a concealed sidearm, which he showed the audience mid-speech while talking about how he personified the Second Amendment. Ignoring the ground rules, he immediately launched into an attack on Morissey, the front-runner.  Outside after his speech, Newbrough smoked while he waited for the candidates in the state races to finish. He knew his chances to win were slim, but he relished the spoiler role. He was determined to keep Morrisey out of office.  \u201cI think Tom is going to win,\u201d Newbrough said between drags. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s common sense. He\u2019s like me. He says it like it is.\u201d  Inside, lunch was served. Willis had another campaign stop, but before ducking out, he made a point to meet with the two influencers in the room. A handshake. A smile.  Schaffer hung back, his eyes on his cell phone. The campaign was waiting for confirmation on several endorsements from national veteran PACs. Willis would get six.  \u201cTom is genuine,\u201d Shaffer, a veteran of several statewide campaigns, told me when asked why he\u2019d signed up with Willis. \u201cNo slickness. No political speak.\u201d  On the way to the next stop, Willis got a call from his wife, Sara. She was excited to tell him about a volunteer who has flooded the eastern panhandle of the state with campaign signs.  \u201cEverywhere they turned there was a sign for you,\u201d she said excitedly on speakerphone.  Willis, in the passenger seat, smiled. His shoulders relaxed.  \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the impact one dedicated volunteer can make,\u201d he said.  Tom Willis west virginia senate A longshot It was impossible to miss the 293-foot gold dome of West Virginia\u2019s State Capitol as Willis cruised downtown looking for a local TV station.  It was Tuesday, and his day is packed with interviews, a ribbon cutting for the opening of his second campaign office at the Glen Ferris Inn, and the announcement of his jobs program.  The TV interview would be with Mark Curtis, host of \u201cInside West Virginia Politics.\u201d Willis was upbeat. \u201cI think it is going to come down to a couple hundred votes,\u201d he was saying. \u201c30,000 votes probably wins the race.\u201d The career politicians are fading, he added. \u201cI\u2019m the only one moving up fast. Morrisey is falling fast, and the two leaders have plateaued. If I had four more months, I\u2019d win by ten points.\u201d  Curtis, a veteran political reporter, met Willis at the station\u2019s door. In the studio, the show\u2019s graphic filled the monitor behind the small stage. As they waited for the signal to begin, Curtis went over the format.  \u201cI don\u2019t do interviews,\u201d he said. \u201cI do conversations.\u201d  He paused before they started recording.  \u201cThis is a chance for you to introduce yourself to a lot of people who don\u2019t know who you are,\u201d Curtis said.  The five-minute interview went by fast. Willis looked relaxed, at ease in front of the cameras. It\u2019s a skill he was still mastering. He used to look down while he thought of an answer, he\u2019d admitted, breaking eye contact with the interviewer and appearing unsure. Tuesday, Willis beamed at Curtis and the cameras.  \u201cYou impressed a lot of people at the debate,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cWhy run for Senate?\u201d  It\u2019s a question Willis gets a lot. To the political elite, Willis was cutting the line by skipping a run for state office and going for a Senate seat. But he wasn\u2019t sure how much good he could do in the state legislature or on a school board.  \u201cThis is the one I\u2019m best qualified for,\u201d he told Curtis. \u201cThere is no other candidate in West Virginia that has the legal pedigree, the national security pedigree.\u201d  Curtis has covered the race from the start. \u201cThe more people hear him, the more people like him,\u201d Curtis told Task & Purpose. \u201cHe has enough time to be a factor.\u201d  Curtis said Willis fits the trend of political novices willing to reject political norms and run on their own terms. \u201cPeople dislike politicians,\u201d he explained. \u201cPeople like a longshot.\u201d  Even as the polls have Willis gaining only single digit support \u2014 not even enough to qualify for a recent Fox News debate \u2014 he still predicts victory on May 8.  \u201cRemember Trump lost badly in all the polls too,\u201d Willis said with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the polls for a minute. It\u2019s going to be a photo finish.\u201d","articles_date":"3 5 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/taskandpurpose.com\/tom-willis-west-virginia-senate\/","articles_title":"The Operator: A Green Beret Turned Senate Candidate Wages An \u2018Ideological\u2019 Battle On The Homefront","candidate_fk":8,"first_name":"Tom","id":6,"last_name":"Willis","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":3},{"article_text":"HUNTINGTON - Several recent polls show three of the six Republicans running for a West Virginia seat in the U.S. Senate locked in a competitive race to win their party's nomination in the May 8 primary election.  West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and former coal baron Don Blankenship appear to be running in a tight three-way primary, while the three other candidates - Tom Willis, Jack Newbrough and Bo Copley - are trailing the top three with single-digit poll numbers.  With the popularity of President Donald Trump in West Virginia, the Republican Party thinks it can pick up a seat in the Senate currently being occupied by Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin, who is seeking re-election in the Democratic primary on May 8. Manchin faces Paula Jean Swearengin in the Democratic race.  Here is a look at the six Republican candidates and their views:  Patrick Morrisey  Morrisey says as West Virginia attorney general, he has worked tirelessly to defend conservative West Virginia values, including defending life; expanding gun rights; suing President Barack Obama's EPA and protecting coal; suing Obama over Obamacare and his illegal amnesty program; and finally, aggressively tackling the opioid tragedy in West Virginia.  \"Now, I'm running for Senate to continue this fight and protect West Virginia from the liberals in Washington,\" he said. \"I have worked with President Trump as attorney general to protect our West Virginia conservative values, and I look forward to standing with President Trump as West Virginia's next U.S. senator.\"  Morrisey says he is the only candidate in this race with a proven conservative record of accomplishing results for West Virginia.  Morrisey wants voters to carefully examine each candidate's past.  \"I believe the best way to look at whether a candidate will fight for the issues that are important to voters is to look at what the candidate has done in the past,\" he said. \"My record of conservative results for West Virginia is clear. Time and again, I have stood with President Trump and against President Obama in defense of West Virginia. Unfortunately, my opponents in this primary do not share my record of conservative results.\"  Morrisey said if elected, his priorities would be twofold.  \"First, we need to do everything in our power to bring good-paying jobs back to West Virginia, and that starts with getting rid of the regulatory red tape in Washington,\" he said. \"As attorney general, I was able to make some headway on this issue by suing President Obama, but there is still more to be done. Now that President Trump is in the White House, we have an opportunity to rejuvenate our economy.  \"Second, I will continue to focus on tackling the opioid crisis on a holistic basis. Recently, I sued the DEA, which will result in a dramatically reduced opioid supply nationwide. Unfortunately, the very people in Washington who were supposed to protect us from a deluge of pain pills have been asleep at the switch. It's critical that we hold these people accountable and demand action.\"  Morrisey, of Harpers Ferry in Jefferson County, is West Virginia's first Republican attorney general since 1933. He was elected in 2012 and re-elected in 2016 and says he is a conservative champion for Mountain State families and taxpayers.  Evan Jenkins  Jenkins, of Huntington, says his platform is also consistent with President Trump. He claims he is the only candidate in the Republican field who supported Trump from the beginning.  \"I am a West Virginia conservative who is working with President Trump each and every day for our shared conservative values,\" he said. \"My beliefs and principles are resolute. I believe that our constitutional rights cannot be restricted.\"  Jenkins said his record is 100 percent pro-life and 100 percent in favor of the Second Amendment.  \"I have a perfect rating from the NRA and am proud of it. I have fought tooth and nail to defend our constitutional rights and the Second Amendment and will continue to do so as your senator,\" he said. \"My commitment to the sanctity of human life has never, and will never, waver. With a 100 percent pro-life voting record in Congress, I have always stood on the side of life. In the U.S. Senate, I will remain a champion for the unborn.\"  Jenkins says if elected that he would focus on creating jobs, which he believes solves a lot of problems.  \"The Obama administration's policies have devastated our state and led directly to the loss of good-paying West Virginia jobs,\" Jenkins said. \"I believe that a good job solves a lot of problems, and getting people back to work is critical to ending the opioid crisis that has destroyed too many lives. I'm focused on bringing a pro-jobs agenda to Washington, one that will provide certainty to West Virginia businesses and create jobs for the hardworking families in our state. And I will stand up to the Washington liberals to protect our God-given rights.\"  Don Blankenship  Blankenship, of Sprigg in Mingo County, says he is running on a platform that is very much in line with Trump.  \"Regulations have cost us our economy and, to a great extent, our quality of life,\" he said. \"We also need to stop illegal immigration and build the wall. This is very much in line with President Trump.\"  Blankenship said he is an anti-establishment candidate and is not a career politician. He says he wants to tackle federal government waste, create jobs, support coal, help stop the opioid epidemic and close the borders.  \"I am socially very conservative on abortion and a strong believer on the First and Second Amendments,\" he said. \"I have more experience by far than any other candidate in dealing with the government from the outside. The other candidates are very much establishment and government guys.\"  Blankenship says he is also the only candidate that has created jobs.  He is the former CEO of Massey Energy. He was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of conspiring to willfully violate safety standards in relation to the Upper Big Branch mine explosion that killed 29 people. He served a year in prison, all the while saying he was innocent.  Tom Willis  Tom Willis, of Hedgesville in Berkeley County, says West Virginia needs strong representation in Washington.  \"We need good jobs and support for small business,\" he said. \"We need someone actively protecting our Second Amendment rights, and we need someone who will promote West Virginian family values, to include protecting the unborn, standing up for us in Washington.\"  Willis says he is the only candidate in the race who is a veteran and says he is a \"non-politician.\"  \"I'm a combat veteran, an officer in the West Virginia National Guard and a Green Beret honor graduate,\" he said. \"As a tax attorney, I also understand how complex the tax codes are and how they stifle business growth and entrepreneurship. I'm a business owner, husband, father and a man of faith. My real world experiences, training, expertise and beliefs make me the most qualified and best candidate running.\"  Willis said one priority for him, if elected, would be to address the opioid epidemic.  \"West Virginia has one of the worst opioid drug addiction problems in the country but hasn't seen federal funding to match,\" he said. \"We need to be open to giving people second chances, including alternative sentencing, and be open to working in cooperation with faith-based recovery programs that statistically reduce recidivism rates. We must address the hopelessness at the root of the problem and deal with it with compassion.\"  Bo Copley  Bo Copley, of Delbarton in Mingo County, says after working for 11 years in the mining industry he was abruptly laid off in September 2015.  In May 2016, Copley was seated at a roundtable discussion with Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., where he confronted Clinton on her words of \"putting coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"  Subsequent to the 2016 presidential race, Copley was named one of 16 people who influenced the 2016 election by Yahoo News.  Copley says he is running as a constitutional conservative who, as a U.S. senator, will introduce and promote legislation that will protect unborn children, foster job growth and promote the well-being of all West Virginians.  \"I am a West Virginian, not a politician,\" he said. \"I am not using this race as a stepping stone to higher office, and am running because I believe Washington needs more middle-class Americans in office who can relate to the struggles West Virginians face every day.\"  Copley says he would breathe fresh life into a U.S. Senate that is currently dominated and controlled by special interest groups and career politicians.  \"I am both a lifelong Republican and West Virginian, which cannot be said by some of the other candidates,\" he said. \"I have worked in the private sector my entire life.\"  Copley says he is against abortion in any form.  \"As a devout Christian and father of three beautiful children, I cannot one day meet my maker and say that I support abortion in any form,\" he said. \"I oppose abortion in all shapes, forms and sizes and believe that life begins at conception. I will fight each and every day to protect the unborn.\"  Copley said his priorities, if elected, would also include jobs, energy and education.  \"The key to a strong economy is a citizenry that is employed,\" he said. \"In order for West Virginians and Americans across the U.S. to find good-paying jobs that can support families, we must make it easier for businesses to operate. High tax rates are devastating to businesses and individuals, and America needs to cut its frivolous spending as well as its tax rates.  \"I pledge to work tirelessly to defend West Virginia's interests from Washington bureaucrats and to promote coal, oil and gas as the common-sense solutions to America's energy needs.\"  Jack Newbrough  Jack Newbrough, of Weirton in Brooke and Hancock counties, says he is running on a \"veterans first and foremost\" platform, along with doing something about the opioid crisis in West Virginia.  \"I'm a U.S. Navy veteran and an over-the-road truck driver,\" he said. \"I'm a native West Virginian, born and raised.\"  Newbrough calls himself the \"blue collar candidate.\"  \"I drive semis for a living and make about $45,000 a year,\" he said. \"I am just like most West Virginians who are benefiting from President Trump's tax cuts. I see all issues with illegal immigration and infrastructure every day.\"  Newbrough says if elected, his priorities would be to fix the VA and tackle the opioid crisis head-on.  \"Everything that is happening in West Virginia has affected me personally,\" he said. \"My son's mother lost her life to opioid addiction about 10 years ago. With her taking opioids while being pregnant has caused my son to suffer from ADHD and autism.\"  Newbrough says he has taken no donations from anyone or accepted donations from special interest groups like his opponents.  \"I would love to prove a point that you don't need to raise millions to win an election,\" he said.","articles_date":"1 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.williamsondailynews.com\/news\/six-republican-candidates-running-for-us-senate-in-west-virginia\/article_4d6a2e62-af4e-53e9-a6af-42c2c415f31d.html","articles_title":"Six Republican candidates running for US Senate in West Virginia","candidate_fk":8,"first_name":"Tom","id":6,"last_name":"Willis","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":3},{"article_text":"When former Green Beret Tom Willis decided to venture into politics, he didn\u2019t tiptoe.  He surged.  Willis, co-owner of the historic Glen Ferris Inn in Fayette County, a tax attorney and a National Guardsman, blew past the state level races and a shot at the Republican congressional seat in the GOP primaries.  Instead, Willis set his sights on the same prize Rep. Evan Jenkins wants \u2014 Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s seat in the United States Senate.  It was inevitable that he\u2019d want to go after a Senate seat, he told The Register-Herald.  \u201cThe simple answer is because I\u2019m going to win,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I can.  \u201cI\u2019m the best guy to beat Joe Manchin.\u201d  Pointing out that he\u2019s a veteran and West Virginia business owner, Willis said has spent much of his adult life in 20 countries on several continents as a Green Beret and second in command of a U.S. Army Special Forces Battalion. He also speaks four languages.  \u201cI think internationally and nationally ... What good is that going to do me, as a delegate from Berkeley County?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe job I can do, better than anybody else, especially Manchin, is U.S. Senator.\u201d  Willis\u2019 battlefield for the GOP primary is tough and includes not only Jenkins, who recently accepted an endorsement from President Donald Trump, but also coal baron and longtime Manchin foe Don Blankenship, and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Brooklyn native and former Washington lobbyist.  He said he decided to enter the political realm because the state needs help. He noted that West Virginia has the highest number of veterans per capita, but has no veterans serving the state\u2019s interests on the national level in this district.  He said a commanding officer once stopped to pick up trash from a parking lot and told Willis that if he\u2019s out and notices trash, he shouldn\u2019t walk past it.  \u201cWe\u2019re last in everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of people suffering in our state.  \u201cThere are some ideologies creeping in that are dangerous to the American dream,\u201d he added. \u201cI can\u2019t walk by that trash.  \u201cI know I can be part of the solution. Somebody\u2019s got to stand and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got problems, but with leadership we can find solutions.\u2019  \u201cIt\u2019s just a call to service. It really just boils down to duty and honor and a call to service. You have a moral obligation, if you see a problem, and I know I can lead.\u201d  He supports Trump\u2019s environmental policies that allow for fewer restrictions on coal production.  His economic vision for the state, however, is detailed \u2014 creating 15,000 jobs over the next six years \u2014 and depends heavily on small business development. A long-term goal is to wean the state from subsidies, he said.  \u201cThe path forward for West Virginia is small business,\u201d Willis said. \u201cEighty percent of all new jobs are created through small business.  \u201cOur state economic development department is trying to bring in the Proctors and Gambles, like we\u2019ve got in the Eastern Panhandle.  \u201cBut if we\u2019re really going to change the state, it\u2019s going to come from small business.\u201d  He said his goal is to bring in a pool of candidates who are interested in starting a business, particularly in select sectors, and to offer access to more than 9,000 online free or low-cost training programs via a partnership with a non-profit organization.  \u201cQualify them,\u201d he said. \u201cProvide them know-how or business plans. Then you find them capital.  \u201cA senator can get access to capital. We can build Gatlinburg (Tenn.) right here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a small example.\u201d  Willis offered his positions on the issues:  President Trump: \u201cPeople ask, do you support our president? I say, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t give anybody a blank check. He\u2019s our commander-in-chief. We should support him. We should pray for him. That\u2019s what we\u2019re told to do. On the economy, I support him 100 percent.\u201d  He joked that Trump\u2019s \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d to date was failing to endorse him. He said that Trump has had \u201cunprecedented attacks\u201d by 95 percent of the media.  \u201cThe Wall\u201d: Willis said he supports construction of the wall between Mexico and the United States for security purposes. He said an unchecked border allows human traffickers and drug dealers to enter, along with terrorists from foreign countries.  Tax reform: Willis is in favor of a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget.  \u201cI think one of the greatest threats to our national security is our national debt,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to many countries, and they have a fancy plane they bought, fancy weapon systems, but, literally, I talk to the pilots, they don\u2019t have the gas to fly it. They can\u2019t afford the gas, or they can\u2019t afford the bullets.  \u201cOur national debt is a national security risk because it takes money to fund the military.\u201d  Health care: Willis, whose son is a bone cancer survivor, believes that the health care market is a \u201cprivate sector realm.\u201d To provide more coverage, he proposes allowing insurance companies to operate across state lines and to reduce administrative costs in health care by limiting the amount of damages patients can seek against hospitals.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got 200,000 newly dependent on the federal government now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost that dignity. They\u2019ve lost that freedom. They\u2019re dependent on others for their provisions.\u201d  He said those who can\u2019t get insured in the private sector due to pre-existing conditions should be protected in some way by government, possibly through subsidized premiums purchased on the private market.  \u201cWe need to pull them out of the (privately insured) population,\u201d he said. \u201cThat reduces costs for insurance companies, so they\u2019re dealing with a predominantly healthy population.\u201d  Veterans\u2019 health care: \u201cI believe the veterans have earned the right to choose, so the veterans should have the choice,\u201d eh said. \u201cYounger veterans prefer private providers.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got the VA Choice program that\u2019s working right now,\u201d he added. \u201cThe problem with the VA Choice is that it\u2019s run by the VA.\u201d  Reproductive rights: Willis said he believes life is sacred and begins at conception. He would support measures making abortion illegal.  When asked if women who have illegal abortions would be charged with murder or another crime, he did not answer but said he favored avenues of making adoption easier. If a pregnancy must be carried to term under federal mandate, he would consider financial compensation for the pregnant American. He would explore measures to make men more legally accountable for preventing unwanted pregnancies.","articles_date":"7 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.fayettetribune.com\/news\/willis-bid-for-u-s-senate-was-inevitable\/article_2af39a04-522f-11e8-9a25-0b5d86d254c1.html","articles_title":"Willis\u2019 bid for U.S. Senate was \u201cinevitable\u201d","candidate_fk":8,"first_name":"Tom","id":6,"last_name":"Willis","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":1},{"article_text":"CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 During a January appearance on MetroNews \u201cTalkline,\u201d Republican Senate candidate Tom Willis spoke about how being a political outsider would make him stand out in the primary field as well as against Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in a potential face-off  \u201cI look at where we are in the rankings as a state with West Virginia and I look at what the career politicians are doing in D.C., and frankly I\u2019m not satisfied with either and I don\u2019t think our fellow West Virginians are either,\u201d the National Guard major said on the Jan. 25 program.  More than two months later, Willis said momentum is on his side, pointing to the April 3 Republican candidate debate in Martinsburg in which U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship also participated.  \u201cI do think as the voters of West Virginia were looking at the four of us on the stage and saying who is the most senatorial or who do I want to represent me as the next U.S. senator for West Virginia, I think that they were looking at Tom Willis,\u201d he said in an interview last week.  Willis said he offers voters a candidate with solid conservative principals and diverse experience; in addition to his military service, the Hedgesville resident also is the co-owner of the Glen Ferris Inn in Fayette County and previously was a tax attorney in Washington, D.C. His resume has caught the attention of news outlets based outside of West Virginia, such as CNN and Fox Business Network.  \u201cWhen news stations are looking for credible authorities to comment on whatever topic, really my resume fits any bill,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an easy fit.\u201d  During the debate, Willis said he was anti-abortion, against gun control policies and a proponent of stricter immigration policies, which he said last week Congress has failed to act upon.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t fund the wall, we couldn\u2019t come to a deal on the immigration debate and we still have weak enforcement laws. All of these send a signal that the border\u2019s open,\u201d he said.  The omnibus spending bill passed in March includes $1.5 billion for infrastructure on the U.S.-Mexico border, including physical barriers and \u201cassociated technology.\u201d According to a memo from House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., the funding would cover construction for more than 90 miles of a border wall.  With Republicans passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, Willis said immigration and national security are the two issues President Donald Trump will likely make a top priority after the general election.  \u201cIt really helps to have a veteran voice to be heard on those issues because I\u2019ve worked with U.S. Southern Command, I\u2019ve worked in South America and I have years of professional experience in a military uniform fighting against terrorist organizations, drug organizations, terrorist crime organizations that were specifically targeting our country through the southern border,\u201d he said.  According to the American Immigration Council, fewer than 5,000 people living in West Virginia illegally. The U.S. Census Bureau reports 1.6 percent of the state\u2019s 1.8 million residents are immigrants.  \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that\u2019s obviously beyond our borders here in West Virginia,\u201d Willis said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a U.S. Senate seat, so we have to send people that see a bigger picture of not only what\u2019s good for West Virginia but for our nation.\u201d  With the May 8 primary approaching, Willis said he is confident in his chances, noting a growth in interest in his candidacy following the Martinsburg debate.  \u201cAs soon as people find out that I\u2019m a veteran and that I\u2019m a Senate candidate, we win by a two-to-one margin over the other candidates,\u201d Willis said of his campaign\u2019s internal poll numbers.  \u201cWest Virginia has the highest percentage of veterans in the country, but zero veterans in our U.S. congressional delegation. And that just doesn\u2019t make sense, and I think West Virginians get that.\u201d  The increase in attention also includes from non-Republicans; West Virginia Democratic Party Chairwoman Belinda Biafore criticized Jenkins, Morrisey and Blankenship after the debate, but said Willis \u201cseems like a very nice man.\u201d  \u201cLooking beyond (the primary), I think we need a candidate that can appeal to the broader spectrum of West Virginians as a whole because that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to beat Joe Manchin,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s further evidence that I\u2019m the best choice.\u201d","articles_date":"16 4 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/wvmetronews.com\/2018\/04\/16\/willis-momentum-growing-as-primary-draws-closer\/","articles_title":"Willis: Momentum growing as primary draws closer","candidate_fk":8,"first_name":"Tom","id":6,"last_name":"Willis","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":5},{"article_text":"For those of you concerned about whether Russians and other bad actors around the globe are trying to subvert our nation\u2019s democracy and set us against one another by interfering in our electoral process (they are, by the way), here\u2019s your chance to fire back: Go vote. That\u2019s what patriots do.  Apathy is the weapon of those who oppose us and our institutions of freedom. Enemies of our republic want us to care less, to leave decisions to someone else, to acquiesce, to take what comes. They want us to believe that a single vote does not matter.  Well, it does, especially in races where vote totals will be in the hundreds, not hundreds of thousands. There are a good many school board races on the ballot this spring \u2013 and for those candidates, this is not a primary but the real deal.  Likewise, there are many races for the state House of Delegates and state Senate where a single vote could carry the day for some fortunate candidate.  You can also do the math and come to a realization that one vote per precinct could make a world of difference in a race for Congress \u2013 for either the U.S. Senate or the Congressional 3rd District \u2013 especially if there are more than just a couple of candidates running for office, as there are in both of these contests.  So, yes, your vote can make a difference, but only if you exercise your right as guaranteed by our nation\u2019s constitution.  The other piece of business you will need to attend to is finding a candidate who is worthy of your support \u2013 and you just may have to look beyond the canned goods.  While we are not endorsing any candidate in any race for the primaries (we will in the fall for the general election), there are quality candidates on both sides of the political aisle.  And, if you are like us, more than a bit disappointed with those candidates who seem to be favored heading toward the wire, we would encourage you to consider candidates who may be just off the radar.  For instance, Tom Willis \u2013 a candidate for U.S. Senate and a conservative\u2019s conservative \u2013 seems like the kind of fresh face who is unsullied by Big Pharma or the political donor class. If you are a Republican and would like a candidate who has boots-on-the-ground military knowledge of foreign affairs, if you are looking for someone who knows first-hand the challenges of running a business that caters to tourists here in West Virginia, well, maybe he\u2019s your guy.  Likewise in the race for Congress out of the 3rd District, again on the Republican side of the ledger, Dr. Ayne Amjad has impeccable credentials \u2013 as a person and a professional. A Beckley native who was educated in both private and public schools and received a Masters degree in Public Health ahead of her Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) at Marshall University, Amjad seems to be the kind of collaborator, consensus builder and thinker that is needed in D.C. to attend to the people\u2019s business. You want to solve the opioid crisis? Who better, a politician or a doctor who has been on the front lines? You want to shake things up and drain the swamp? How about electing a person of high character, steeped in integrity, who is as honest as the day is long.  Again, these are not endorsements but only an acknowledgement that citizens do have options beyond the obvious, beyond incumbents, beyond the same-old, same-old. There are other fine candidates on the ballot.  And for those who have yet to cast a ballot, you can bone up with a little research at various online sites \u2013 including register-herald.com.  Go ahead, get cracking. Do a little homework. And then head to the polls on Tuesday. It\u2019ll really tick off some Russian bot and make you feel proud to be an American \u2013 exercising a freedom so many have died to protect.  Be a patriot. Vote.","articles_date":"6 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.register-herald.com\/opinion\/editorials\/study-up-and-go-vote-options-exist\/article_dc8e8e0b-9e7a-51fd-ad93-d4b51fc8d6be.html","articles_title":"Study up and go vote; options exist","candidate_fk":8,"first_name":"Tom","id":6,"last_name":"Willis","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":7},{"article_text":"Morrisey receives endorsement from Family Policy Council  HARPERS FERRY, W.Va. - Republican U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey has received the endorsement of the Family Policy Council of West Virginia, an organization allied with the Family Research Council, a socially conservative organization.  The organization, which is committed to advancing faith, family, and freedom in public policy, cited Morrisey's proven track record of fighting for the unborn and standing up for conservative values in its decision.  \"For years, Patrick Morrisey has taken fiery darts from the hostile media because he's consistently defended the unborn,\" said Allen Whitt, president of the Family Policy Council, in a news release. \"He's also a skilled tactician whose legal strategy prevented Obama's co-ed, public school bathroom disaster from endangering our schoolgirls in West Virginia.

The PAC determined Willis, a Green Beret veteran and West Virginia National Guardsman, is the best candidate in the West Virginia Senate race to fight for national defense and to look out for men and women in uniform, according to a news release.  \"With veteran representation in Congress at historic lows, it's a tragedy West Virginia has no veterans in its Congressional delegation ... West Virginia's National Guardsmen, military families, and deployed active duty military personnel need elected representatives, like Tom Willis, who understand the impact of sending our troops into harm's way with wholly inadequate budgets, as Joe Manchin's done since he went to the Senate,\" said Bob \"Shoebob\" Carey, a retired U.S. Navy Captain and chairman of National Defense PAC.

This was the first and only debate scheduled to include all six candidates running for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat before the primary election.  \"People are tired of having career politicians move into these positions and make decisions for us,\u201d Copley said.  Willis said there is a certain type of candidate right now who is winning races \"non-politician, a political outsider who has maybe a business background and is a veteran.\"  While they all support President Donald Trump, they said they do so for different reasons.  \"I\u2019m the candidate to beat Joe Manchin, and I\u2019m working with Donald Trump and making sure that Donald Trump does not get impeached.

Topics ranged from welfare, to gun control to the opioid crisis.  \"We shouldn't be giving welfare recipients benefits that make it more attractive to stay at the house than work,\u201d Blankenship said.

The dinner honored Delegate John Overington for his 34 years of service as a West Virginia legislator with a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition from U. S. Representative Alex Mooney and gift card from the club.  \u201cCan you imagine, 34 years? He goes to all the events and supports everybody. He answers his emails and is very giving,\u201d said Lala Mooney, who presented the certificate to Overington.  Following the dinner, four of the six Republican candidates vying for Senator Joe Manchin\u2019s seat spoke about their stances on handling illegal immigration, national security and the economy. U. S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and Jack Newbrough, of Weirton, could not attend.  \u201cWe have a great state motto here: Mountaineers are always free. One of the reasons I\u2019m running for Senate is because as Attorney General I can only go after the bad guys. If you send me to the Senate, I\u2019ll go after the stupid laws, too,\u201d said W.Va. Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who said he is the only one of the four candidates endorsed by West Virginians for Life and all of West Virginia\u2019s conservative political organizations.  Morrisey said he would deal with illegal immigration with a supply-demand perspective.  \u201cOne of my drill sergeants said, \u2018Don\u2019t walk by trash, make it right,\u2019 and that stuck with me,\u201d said Green Beret Distinguished Honor Graduate and former Special Forces team leader Tom Willis, who is still a member of the National Guard. \u201cIt\u2019s important for West Virginia to send a veteran to Washington to deal with national security concerns. We need a non-politician, a veteran to beat Joe Manchin.\u201d  Willis said he would apply that mindset in Washington, D. C., and as a veteran would appropriately represent West Virginia, which is the state with the highest number of veterans. He said none of West Virginia\u2019s Congressional representatives are veterans.  Willis hopes to strengthen the state\u2019s economy through his involvement with Jobenomics West Virginia, which has a plan to create 15,000 jobs throughout the state.  \u201cWe need to sell more than timber and coal. We need to be out front on technology,\u201d said retired accountant and business executive Don Blankenship.  Blankenship said he is confident the charges against him, alleging his conspiracy to violate mine safety and health standards, will be overturned.  First-time political candidate and laid off miner Bo Copley, of Mingo County, agreed with Blankenship about the need to diversify West Virginia\u2019s economy. He also spoke about his confrontation of then-presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton in a 2016 round-table discussion about her position against coal. He said his winning Manchin\u2019s seat would be ironic, since Manchin supported Clinton\u2019s election.  \u201cI think it would be poetic justice if you would allow this out-of-work miner to take Senator Manchin\u2019s place,\u201d Copley said.","articles_date":"13 4 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.journal-news.net\/news\/local-news\/2018\/04\/republicans-honor-overington-allow-candidates-to-speak\/","articles_title":"Republicans honor Overington, allow candidates to speak","candidate_fk":8,"first_name":"Tom","id":6,"last_name":"Willis","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":6},{"article_text":"WEIRTON \u2014 Tom Willis feels his momentum is growing in the race for representing West Virginia in the U.S. Senate.  Willis, among the Republican field of candidates hoping to unseat Joe Manchin in this year\u2019s election, was in Weirton Wednesday, meeting with residents and discussing some of his plans if elected.  The Hedgesville, W.Va. resident admits his campaign had a later start than those of other candidates, and as a non-politician he doesn\u2019t have the name recognition of others, but he has seen voters begin to pay more attention to his message.  \u201cWe know we are within clear striking distance of first place,\u201d Willis said. \u201cIt\u2019s anybody\u2019s race at this point.\u201d  Willis is seeking the Republican nomination in West Virginia\u2019s May 8 primary election, facing off against Don Blankenship, Bo Copley, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, and Weirton resident Jack Newbrough.  \u201cI\u2019m not an established politician,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI\u2019m not a career politician.\u201d  Willis said he sees a need to focus on economic development in the Mountain State, explaining he recently was named the director of Jobenomics, an organization which places a focus on people in job creation.  \u201cWe need to change the culture in West Virginia to more of an entrepreneurial mindset,\u201d Willis said, noting 80 percent of new jobs are created through small business. \u201cThat\u2019s the path forward.\u201d  Jobenomics, he explained, has a plan aimed at created 15,000 jobs in the next six years by recruiting those interested in starting their own small business, providing them with training and educational opportunities and assisting them with finding capital to fund their start-up efforts.  Willis said he feels his own experience as a business owner, operating the Glen Ferris Inn in Fayette County, will be an asset in Washington, D.C., as it gives him a first-hand perspective on the needs of small businesses, as well as how businesses are affected by federal taxation and regulation.  While he said there has been growth in West Virginia\u2019s Eastern Panhandle, and the state\u2019s Northern Panhandle has seen a surge because of the natural gas industry, more work is needed.  \u201cThere are parts of our state that are doing well, but much of our state is suffering,\u201d he said.  Willis also is a veteran, first coming to West Virginia in 2000 to join the National Guard. He is a Green Beret and remains active in the West Virginia National Guard Reserves.  He said his military experience will provide needed insight in national defense issues, whether in the Middle East, with Russia or even with allies in Asia.  \u201cWe\u2019re engaged in a long-term chess match with these countries,\u201d Willis said.  Willis noted only around 20 percent of current members of Congress have served in the military.  No one currently representing West Virginia at the federal level has served, he said, adding the state has the highest percentage of residents who are veterans compared to the rest of the country.  Noting he is pro-life, and an advocate for the Second Amendment and the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, Willis said he wants to make sure the federal government plays its proper role.  \u201cThe business of governance is serious business, and it affects us every day,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI want to be a part of the solution at the federal level.\u201d","articles_date":"12 4 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.weirtondailytimes.com\/news\/local-news\/2018\/04\/willis-sees-momentum-on-his-side\/","articles_title":"Willis sees momentum on his side","candidate_fk":8,"first_name":"Tom","id":6,"last_name":"Willis","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1,"issue":6}]
