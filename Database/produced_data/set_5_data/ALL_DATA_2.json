[{"article_text":" (CNN) Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: New Jersey Sen.  Cory Booker  is making the national legalization of marijuana a centerpiece of his  new racial justice bill  -- staking out a position that goes far beyond the decriminalization other Democrats have backed.  The bill is an effort to \"remedy many of the failures of the War on Drugs,\" Booker  wrote on Facebook . It would also aim to undo some damage from marijuana laws by expunging federal marijuana convictions and penalizing states with racially disparate arrests for marijuana-related crimes.  By taking this stance before other major Democrats, Booker has positioned himself as a leader on a social justice issue. California Sen.  Kamala Harris , meanwhile, is championing  legislation  with Kentucky Sen.  Rand Paul  to overhaul pre-trial bail laws so that poorer people aren't stuck behind bars for months while accused of minor crimes.  From a 2020 perspective, Booker's bill is important for two reasons: African-Americans are a hugely important part of the Democratic electorate, starting in South Carolina -- and blacks are disproportionately hit by harsh enforcement marijuana laws. Booker's position is also popular with millennials, most of whom flocked to  Bernie Sanders  in 2016.  News and notes: IOWA'S STEAK FRY RETURNS : The Steak Fry -- that progressive showcase for presidential aspirants long hosted by former Sen.  Tom Harkin  -- is back. Set your calendars for September 30 at Water Works Park in Des Moines, where Polk County Democrats will take over hosting duties and Reps.  Cheri Bustos  of Illinois,  Seth Moulton  of Massachusetts and  Tim Ryan  of Ohio are the headliners of an event that's been dormant since Harkin's 2014 retirement. The three -- all important to House Democrats' future -- are interesting for different reasons: Bustos, a former broadcast journalist, won in a heavily Trump district. Ryan challenged  Nancy Pelosi  for House minority leader and has been making  visits to early states . And Moulton is seen as  a real emerging star  who has raised money and helped recruit candidates and therefore has credibility to challenge his own party.  Here's one more name you should get to know:  Sean Bagniewski . He's the new chairman of the Polk County Democrats -- and a rising star himself in Iowa Democratic politics. He'll get major credit for resurrecting the steak fry, which will be a boon for the county party's coffers.  WAITING FOR DEVAL : Hold on --  Barack Obama  and several of his closest political advisers want the next president to come from Bain Capital? That's what  Politico's Edward-Isaac Dovere reports , noting that Obama has urged former Massachusetts Gov.  Deval Patrick  to consider running in 2020.  Two things you need to know about Patrick: 1) He's a managing director at Bain Capital -- yes,  that  Bain Capital, the one where  Mitt Romney  worked -- where Patrick oversees investments in companies that address social problems. It's the kind of job you take if you  don't  want to run for office again. 2) Obama world knows this is a political liability if Patrick does want to run for office again, but loves him anyway and would line up to work for him.  \"It's true. We all love Deval,\" one senior Obama veteran told me. \"I think he is exactly the right kind of candidate and someone who I truly admire and think has what it takes to win. And I agree that the Bain resume is far from ideal. His other corporate work will also be a tough sell. But he would be top tier right away and attract the best campaign talent.\"  SANDERS SUPPORTERS TARGET HARRIS : Some of  Bernie Sanders ' allies this week amped up their criticism of California Sen.  Kamala Harris  -- a reflection of both the restlessness within his base and that Harris has emerged as a serious 2020 player. Mic's Andrew Joyce highlights  attacks on Harris from National Nurses United's  RoseAnn DeMoro , People for Bernie's  Winnie Wong  and journalist  Nomiki Konst  in noting a \"Bernieland problem.\" They take issue with Harris for cozying up with top Democratic donors, and they blast her for not prosecuting now-Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin during her time as California attorney general. It led to sharp rebuttals ranging from  Neera Tanden , the head of the Center for American Progress, to  Markos Moulitsas , the founder of the progressive blog DailyKos.com, who pointed out that Harris has already taken the policy positions they demanded.  Why attack Harris, and why now? I asked CNN's  Greg Krieg , who covers progressives. Here's his take: \"First off, don't overthink it. Harris is a dynamic politician whose national profile is on the up, along with her fundraising prowess, meaning she is gaining attention -- and attention-grabbing headlines -- as a potential 2020 primary candidate.  For progressive activists who are turned off by parts of her record as California's attorney general, that's a cue to push back. It's as simple as that. She won't be the last center-left 2020 hopeful to have her bona fides questioned by progressives. Nor is this the last time the party establishment returns fire, creating that gnawing sense of 2016 redux. \"It's also important here to consider the state of Sanders' 2020 ambitions. Even as many progressives stay earnestly focused on local races and gaining strength within the Democratic Party apparatus, make no mistake: they are on edge waiting for his decision and will attack anyone they see developing a following that could foreclose his chances in the primary. Hence, the jabs at Harris.\"  One more thought several Democratic operatives expressed to me: Sanders didn't win the nomination in 2016 because he lacked minority support. By attacking a woman of color who is well-liked by Democrats across the board, his allies aren't doing him any favors if he wants to run again in 2020.  WARREN'S HEARING AID BILL PASSES : Massachusetts Sen.  Elizabeth Warren  is known as a liberal firebrand -- but a bill she sponsored with Republican Sens.  Chuck Grassley  and  Johnny Isakson  is now headed to President  Donald Trump 's desk.  The bill  makes hearing aids available over-the-counter  -- which could lower prices and expand availability, since currently only one in six Americans suffering from hearing loss get hearing aids. And significantly, for Warren, it's a tool to rebut charges she's merely a partisan bomb-thrower with nothing to show for her time in the Senate as she runs for re-election. It was the eighth bill to pass the Senate in a roll call vote this year.  ANOTHER ZUCKERBERG POLITICAL HIRE : Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg   added another presidential campaign veteran  this week, with Democratic pollster  Joel Benenson  -- the pollster for Obama and a top adviser to  Hillary Clinton  -- joining Zuckerberg and wife  Priscilla Chan 's nonprofit as a consultant.  Already, Zuckerberg had brought Obama 2008 campaign manager  David Plouffe  on as president of policy and advocacy and hired former  Tim Kaine  spokeswoman  Amy Dudley .  Ken Mehlman , who managed  George W. Bush 's campaign, is on Zuckerberg's board.  The week ahead: Sunday, August 6 -- Former Missouri secretary of state  Jason Kander  headlines the Maine Democratic Party's Muskie  Lobster Bake  at 12 p.m. ET. Thursday, August 10 -- Netroots Nation kicks off in Atlanta. The progressive gathering lasts through Sunday, and  Elizabeth Warren  and former Vice President  Al Gore  are both up Saturday.  Friday, August 11 -- The Iowa Democratic  Wing Ding dinner  in Clear Lake, featuring Kander, California Rep.  Eric Swalwell  and Maryland Rep.  Elijah Cummings , kicks off at 5 p.m. CT. Before you go: Mark Cuban  is giving attorney general  Jeff Sessions   credit  for going after doctors and pharmacies in combatting the opioid crisis. \"If they are using Machine Learning to analyze prescriptions and detect fraud and anomalies I love it,\" Cuban tweeted. ... 'Hell no' caucus tracker: Five senators voted against  Christopher Wray  for FBI director. Among them were three 2020 prospects: Warren, New York Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand  and Oregon Sen.  Jeff Merkley .  CNN's Sophie Tatum, Ashley Killough, Miranda Green, Betsy Klein, Saba Hamedy and Tal Kopan contributed to this memo.","articles_date":"4 8 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/08\/04\/politics\/2020-vision-cory-booker-marijuana-deval-patrick-kamala-harris\/index.html","articles_title":"#2020Vision: Booker's bold marijuana move; Obama world loves Patrick; Why Sanders supporters are attacking Harris","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":1,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race :  Juli\u00e1n Castro  isn't being coy about what his trip to New Hampshire next week to speak to young Democrats in Manchester means: He's weighing a 2020 presidential run.  \"Yeah, I'm interested, but whether or not I end up doing it -- I'll decide that later,\"  he told CNN on Thursday , after speaking at an event at American University in Washington.  First, Castro said, he plans to use the 2018 cycle to help \"young, progressive Democrats\" win midterm races. \"And then after that, after the November election, I'll make a decision by the end of 2018 about my own future,\" he said. \"But during these next few months, I'm going to have a lot of chance to get across the country and listen to what folks are saying and get a sense of what people are thinking.\" There could be a lane for a Latino candidate in the 2020 contest: Nevada is the third state to vote, and delegate-rich California, with huge numbers of Latino voters, moved its primary up to Super Tuesday, immediately following the first four contests.  The 43-year-old former San Antonio mayor and Housing and Urban Development secretary is now traveling the country, using his Opportunity First PAC as a vehicle for his political activity while teaching seminars at the University of Texas at Austin and working on a book.  He also offered an optimistic take on Rep.  Beto O'Rourke 's race against Sen.  Ted Cruz  this fall, saying suburbanites are abandoning the GOP in Texas just like they did in elections in Virginia and Alabama late last year. \"That's happening in the suburbs of Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio. So, it's not just sort of the two-dimensional demographic question we think about in terms of the Latino community. It's also that you have folks in these big-city suburbs that used to be moderate Republicans that, more and more in Texas, have become independents or Democrats. And (President  Donald )  Trump  has done that, and Cruz is having trouble with them right now.\" News and notes: THE OBAMAWORLD PRIMARY: Former Attorney General  Eric Holder  was asked directly at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast this week whether he might run for president and  gave a vague answer: \"We'll see.\"  What's that mean? Some Democratic strategists think Holder isn't serious about running for president \u2014 he just sees the float as helpful for fundraising for his  Barack Obama -backed National Democratic Redistricting Committee. Others say he wouldn't gain much traction even if he did run.  The big picture: Three close Obama friends and allies \u2014 Holder, former Vice President  Joe Biden  and former Massachusetts Gov.  Deval Patrick  \u2014 are now all at least showing some interest in 2020 campaigns. It's the Obamaworld primary, and they could all look to similar universes of advisers, donors and validators within the party. Biden is the universally known, seasoned veteran whose authenticity could be an antidote to President  Donald Trump ; Patrick is the former  David Axelrod  client who Obama himself sees as a top-level talent; and if Holder's push to flip governor's office and state legislatures this fall is successful, he'll have credibility for having done the real work of reversing Democrats' down-ballot fortunes. (Although, asked about Holder, one Democratic strategist said the real figure to watch from the Obama-era Justice Department is  Sally Yates . \"She is a rock star. He is a band manager,\" the strategist said.) \u2014 Biden is ramping up his political travel for Senate incumbents. On Sunday he'll be in Wisconsin for a fundraiser for Sen.  Tammy Baldwin . He's already made in-state visits for fundraisers for Florida Sen.  Bill Nelson  and Indiana Sen.  Joe Donnelly , and in March he'll speak at a Montana Democratic Party event with  Jon Tester  on the ballot this fall.  \u2014 Biden  ripped into  Trump at a House Democratic event this week, saying Trump is hurting the country with \"clannish nationalism\" and \"phony populism.\" \"The President is looking out for himself only. The Republican Party seems to only be looking out for the President,\" Biden said.  GILLIBRAND REJECTS RUBIO-IVANKA FAMILY LEAVE PLAN: The plan  being floated  by Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio , who is working with  Ivanka Trump , would allow people to draw from social security after the birth of a child in exchange for delaying those payments when retirement comes. New York Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand , who has sponsored the more comprehensive and generous  FAMILY Act , dismissed the GOP framework in a statement Wednesday as \"robbing Peter to pay Paul.\" On Thursday, she sent out a  list-building  email with that as the subject line.  CUOMO UNDER ATTACK: The GOP opposition research super PAC America Rising is pounding New York Gov.  Andrew Cuomo  again this week, launching a  web campaign  to highlight the ongoing federal corruption trial of former Cuomo aide  Joe Percoco . Cuomo hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing, but his proximity to the Percoco, a longtime ally and former campaign manager, has made the proceedings an almost daily headache.  America Rising press secretary  Scott Sloofman  explained why the group wants to make it worse: \"A large impetus of work that we've done last year and this year is related to him likely running in 2020,\" he  told Fox Business . \"We believed that since he's running for re-election this year, it's the perfect time to start going after him.\" SETH M. MEETS SETH M.: Massachusetts Rep.  Seth Moulton  played to a national audience on Wednesday night, during a visit NBC's \"Late Night with  Seth Meyers .\"  Talking about his 2014 run , Moulton took a shot at the \"national Democratic establishment,\" which he said discouraged him from challenging nine-term incumbent  John Tierney . \"Fundamentally what they were saying to me, as a veteran, was, 'Do not participate in the democracy you risked your life to defend.' And that's wrong.\" He added: \"The party establishment has gotten us into a terrible position right now. We don't control anything in Washington and so I think it's time for a new generation of Democrats to step up and run.\" ANOTHER PREVIEW OF THE COMING HEALTH CARE BRAWL:  Andy Slavitt , acting CMS administrator under Obama and leading defender of the Affordable Care Act during the GOP's 2017 push to gut it, unveiled a new initiative this week to build bipartisan consensus around health care policy. The group, a nonprofit, is called \"United States of Care\" and it immediately  came under attack by the progressive left , which is accusing Slavitt, a former UnitedHealth Group executive, of working to  undermine the single-payer movement . The group's site talks a lot about \"access\" and \"fiscal responsibility,\" which activists read as code for some version of the status quo. Still, its roster of liberal and independent backers is estimable: former Obama speechwriter and \"Pod Save America\" host  Jon Favreau , Dallas Mavericks owner  Mark Cuban , former Kentucky Gov.  Steve Beshear , former Senate Majority Leader  Tom Daschle , New York City first lady  Chirlane McCray , former Obama OMB director  Peter Orszag , and former top Obama domestic aide  Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz  are all lending their support.  Emily Barson , who spent nearly eight years at Obama's HHS, is the executive director. Not formally connected, but offering his  tweet of approval  on Wednesday: Montana Gov.  Steve Bullock . Before you go:  Facebook  hired  a full-time pollster to monitor  Mark Zuckerberg 's approval rating. ... Oregon Sen.  Jeff Merkley  is among a group of senators  demanding  EPA administrator Scott Pruitt recuse himself from making any rules regarding the Clean Power Plan. ... Massachusetts Sen.

CNN's Saba Hamedy, Ashley Killough, Sophie Tatum, Caroline Kenny, David Siegel and Betsy Klein contributed to this memo.","articles_date":"9 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/09\/politics\/2020-vision-julian-castro-interested\/index.html","articles_title":"#2020Vision: Castro: 'Yeah, I'm interested' in 2020; the Obamaworld primary; Gillibrand rejects Rubio-Ivanka family leave plan","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":2,"issue":8,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: Add another major 2020 Democratic player to the list of supporters of single-payer health insurance: Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand .  \"Yes,\" the New York senator does support single-payer, her senior adviser  Glen Caplin  told me.  Gillibrand first seemed to endorse the idea on the steps outside the Capitol this week, in  a Facebook Live  hosted by New Jersey Sen.  Cory Booker . \"Health care should be a right, it should never be a privilege. We should have Medicare for all in this country,\" she said.  However, Gillibrand in the past hasn't used the phrase \"Medicare for all\" as a substitute for \"single-payer\" the same way  Bernie Sanders  does. Instead, as Caplin pointed out, \"since she first ran for Congress in 2006 in a red district, Kirsten has been advocating for 'Medicare for all' where anyone can buy into Medicare for a price they can afford\" \u2014 that is, by paying a fixed percentage of their income.  That all begged the follow-up: Does Gillibrand support single-payer? Her senior adviser's answer \u2014 \"yes\" \u2014 to that question is a major development for Gillibrand. It positions her with Sanders, progressive activists, and as of this week, Massachusetts Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , who  told The Wall Street Journal  that on health care, \"now it's time for the next step. And the next step is single-payer.\"  Per the Pew Research Center , 52% of Democrats support single-payer. Democrats generally want to set aside the topic of single-payer while they are fighting President  Donald Trump 's effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. But for the 2020 Democratic presidential race, embracing it increasingly seems to be the price of admission into the upper tier. What we're watching: Which Democratic senators will sign on as cosponsors when Sanders filed his single-payer bill? That bill is expected to drop after the Senate Republican push to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's signature domestic legislation reaches its conclusion.  News and notes:  Booker's Facebook Live : That  Cory Booker   Facebook Live  started with just the New Jersey senator and Rep.  John Lewis  of Georgia, the civil rights icon. But more and more Democrats joined them outside the Capitol, and it wound up going more than three hours. The episode was a reminder that Booker \u2014 a pioneer on political Twitter as Newark mayor \u2014 has a magnetic personality that shines through on social media in a way other 2020 prospects might struggle to match.  \u2014 Booker's ties to Wall Street are too close for many progressives' comfort \u2014 and sometimes, as in his refusal to join most Democrats in calling for a full repeal of  Jared Kushner 's security clearance, he plays it safe. But as one Democratic operative put it: \"I don't think litmus tests are going to matter as much as energy and authenticity and Booker has both. ... People find him personally compelling. You can't beat that with a policy critique and that was proven out again on this livestream this week.\"  \u2014 Booker also wrote a letter to the editor of The Washington Post rebutting Attorney General  Jeff Sessions  on criminal sentencing for drug users, accusing Sessions of \" using the politics of fear .\"  The Senate's \"no\" caucus : Booker, Gillibrand and others, including Minnesota Sen.  Al Franken , Virginia Sen.  Tim Kaine  and Connecticut Sen.  Chris Murphy , have said they don't want to run for president. OK ... but should we believe them? I asked some smart Democrats, and most said they really do believe Franken won't run. As for the rest \u2014 and any other top-level Democrat \u2014 it's particularly dangerous at this stage to be seen as fighting for yourself, rather than against Trump.  Biden the lifeguard : Former Vice President  Joe Biden  visited a Delaware pool Monday where years ago he was the only white lifeguard as a child. The pool is being renamed after him \u2014 and Biden also used the visit to make a statement about race and poverty. He said when he worked there, the other lifeguards would \"ask me questions \u2014 because I really was the only white guy they really knew \u2014 about things that just startled me,\" Biden said. \"I remember one lifeguard asked if I had a five-gallon can for gasoline. I said 'No, I don't. But what do you need it for?' He said, 'I'm going down to see my grandmom in North Carolina. We can't stop at most gas stations.  They won't let us stop at most gas stations .' I learned a lot.\"  \u2014  Joe  and  Jill Biden  also  launched  Monday the new Biden Cancer Initiative, a private venture meant to work in tandem with Biden's \"Moonshot\" program.  Warren's advice : Massachusetts Sen.  Elizabeth Warren   gave a bit of a pep talk  to  Samantha Bee  this week, telling her that the way to respond to Trump's presidency is to fight. \"It means that when you're told to be quiet, you don't sit down and be quiet,\" Warren said. \"You stand back up.\" The line shows Warren is still leaning on Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell 's  admonishment  earlier this year. \u2014 Warren directly courted CEOs on health care in  a Forbes op-ed , writing that \"a cold look at the bottom line should be enough to make the business case for preserving the gains achieved by the Affordable Care Act.\"  \u2014 There's a  new super PAC  called \"Deal Her Out\" focused on defeating Warren in her 2018 re-election bid.  Murphy gets a challenger : Connecticut Sen.  Chris Murphy  got his first  challenger  headed into the 2018 midterms:  Dominic Rapini , a Branford businessman who was inspired by Trump's win.  The \"stars\" of 2020 : Speaking of New Hampshire,  the Concord Monitor  named Facebook's  Mark Zuckerberg ,  Oprah Winfrey ,  Mark Cuban , Starbucks founder  Howard Schultz ,  Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson  and actor  Tom Hanks  among the Democratic 2020 prospects, extending an invitation to meet with its editorial board to all of them. (We've heard Schultz is the one to watch in that group.)  The week ahead: \u2014 Monday, July 3: California Sen.  Kamala Harris  will speak at a citizenship ceremony for 41 children and young people from 14 countries. They will be sworn in as US citizens aboard the USS Iowa in San Pedro at 9:15 a.m. PT. She'll also attend a health care rally an hour later in Torrance organized by the SEIU and the #Fight4OurHealth coalition, and then a roundtable on health care at 2:45 p.m. PT in San Francisco.  \u2014 Thursday, July 6:  We talked last week  about  Jason Kander 's visit to Iowa. On July 6, he's  headed to New Hampshire , where he'll deliver Gov. Chris Sununu a petition opposing a Republican bill that tightens voting and registration requirements there. \u2014 Friday, July 7: A Republican event to watch: Nebraska Sen.  Ben Sasse , a prominent Trump critic, will  speak  at a Story County, Iowa, GOP dinner at 6 p.m. CT. Iowa Republican chairman  Jeff Kaufmann  recently lambasted Sasse for his Trump criticism,  saying : \"You know what Sen. Sasse, I really don't care what you like \u2014 we love Donald Trump! And if you don't love him, I'd suggest you stay on your side of the Missouri River.\" The view from the left:  Notes from CNN's Greg Krieg: Former Ohio state Sen.  Nina Turner , one of  Bernie Sanders ' top surrogates during the 2016 primary contest, is the new president of \"Our Revolution,\" the political organization spawned by his campaign. She replaces former Sanders campaign manager  Jeff Weaver .  Why does it matter? Our Revolution owns the vaunted Sanders email list. But its influence \u2014 so far \u2014 has not matched its founding promise. If it's going to be a player in 2020, it needs to back (and attract) winners in 2018. Turner's new job is a nod to that. As board chair  Larry Cohen  told me in a text message last night, \"Our strategy is very much based on building the membership in our hundreds of groups that focus on issues, candidates and party building and the connections between the three. This is much harder work than simply fighting Trump.\" Translation: Turner, an electric speaker and beloved on the progressive left, can fire up the grassroots in a way that Weaver, who rankled the younger, digital-native Sanders campaign vets (a number of whom resigned when he was appointed last year), could not.  So does this mean Turner's potential run for Ohio governor is dead? Online groups have been agitating for her to run. A spokeswoman would only say (twice) that Turner \"has not made a statement\" on the matter. Before you go:  California Sen.  Kamala Harris   took her opposition  to the Senate GOP health care bill to  Lena Dunham 's \"Lenny Letter\" newsletter. ...  Howard Stern  has a \" man crush \" on a Minnesota senator. \"I would be gay with  Al Franken , if I was a gay man,\" he said on his show.  CNN's Sophie Tatum, Ashley Killough, Miranda Green, Saba Hamedy and Betsy Klein contributed to this memo.","articles_date":"30 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/30\/politics\/2020-vision-kirsten-gillibrand-single-payer\/index.html","articles_title":"#2020Vision: Gillibrand backs single-payer; Booker's Facebook Live; Kander goes to New Hampshire","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":3,"issue":2,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: New York Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand  \u2014 who holds what was once  Hillary Clinton 's seat \u2014 just placed herself at the forefront of a Democratic re-evaluation of  Bill Clinton 's legacy.  Asked by The New York Times whether Clinton should have resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations during his time in the Oval Office, Gillibrand said, \" Yes, I think that is the appropriate response .\"  An aide clarified to the newspaper that Gillibrand had meant Clinton would need to resign if his inappropriate relationship with an intern had happened in the current era. \"Things have changed today, and I think under those circumstances there should be a very different reaction,\" Gillibrand told the newspaper. \"And I think in light of this conversation, we should have a very different conversation about President Trump, and a very different conversation about allegations against him.\" Predictably, Clinton world was furious.  \"Over 20 (years) you took the Clintons' endorsements, money, and seat. Hypocrite,\"  tweeted   Philippe Reines , a former  Hillary Clinton  aide. \"Interesting strategy for the 2020 primaries. Best of luck.\"  The comments from Gillibrand, who has been a leading Senate voice on the issues of sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, put her at the forefront of what could reflect a major shift in how Bill Clinton is ultimately viewed.  It comes in the context of a cultural sea change in attitudes toward sexual harassment and assault, in which women's credible claims are more often being taken seriously and treated with zero tolerance. It started with film mogul and Democratic mega-donor  Harvey Weinstein  and   moved on to actors  Kevin Spacey  and  Louis C.K.,   then  Alabama Republican Senate candidate  Roy Moore   and  Minnesota Democratic Sen.  Al Franken .  The moment has also opened the door for a re-examination of the sexual assault claims against President Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. That conversation had already started among some progressives, and Gillibrand just put it on the table for the entire party and for the 2020 race. \"It's going to be a conversation for society and the Democratic Party for months and years to come, I think,\" former  Barack Obama  aide  Dan Pfeiffer   said  on the \"Pod Save America\" podcast Thursday. News and notes: KAINE: ELIMINATE SUPERDELEGATES: The 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, Virginia Sen.  Tim Kaine , sided with Vermont independent Sen.  Bernie Sanders  and called on the party to eliminate superdelegates. \"These positions are given undue influence in the popular nominating contest and make the process less democratic,\" Kaine, a superdelegate himself,  wrote in a letter this week  to Democratic National Committee chairman  Tom Perez . The DNC's Unity Reform Commission is currently considering proposals to reduce the number of superdelegates. AN ENDORSEMENT BOOKER WON'T WANT: New Jersey Sen.  Robert Menendez , celebrating the mistrial in his corruption case Wednesday, praised home-state Sen.  Cory Booker  for backing him and then delivered a 2020 endorsement Booker might not want: \"He's a public servant with an unlimited potential who can easily  serve our country in the highest office  in the land,\" Mendendez said.  \u2014 Booker will speak at the Victory Institute's three-day LGBTQ leadership conference in Washington next month. The event, which more than 500 LGBTQ elected officials and advocates will attend, is December 6-9.  MCAULIFFE TO HELP THE DNC: Outgoing Virginia Gov.  Terry McAuliffe  is hosting the DNC's year-end fund-raising reception \u2014 making him one of the only 2020 prospects willing to raise money for a party organization that has lagged far behind Republicans in fund-raising. It's also one of the first moves beyond the Virginia governor's office that McAuliffe will have made after Lt. Gov.  Ralph Northam 's big win there last week.  Politico's Gabriel Debenedetti has more details . BIDEN ON 2020: 'WHO KNOWS': Former Vice President  Joe Biden   didn't rule out a 2020 presidential run  as he kicked off his book tour this week. \"I'm a great respecter of fate ... but who knows what the situation is going to be a year and a half from now. I don't have any idea. I'm in good health now. I'm in good shape, knock on wood, as my mother would say. But I just, I don't know,\" he said on NBC's \"Today.\"  \u2014 Is Biden too old to run for president? He's 74 and would be 77 on Election Day 2020, and in his 80s his entire second term, if he wins and is re-elected. The Washington Post's  Paul Kane  made an interesting point in  a recent chat with CNN's  Chris Cillizza : \"The distance from 74 to 86 is big for any human, let alone one that would spend eight years of that span in the toughest job in the world,\" Kane said. \"I've watched, up close, as a number of senators who were incredibly sharp and energetic in their mid-70s turn very slow and plodding by their early 80s. We have to think, as a society, whether we want the leader of the free world to be challenging Father Time.\" \u2014 An interesting comment from Massachusetts Rep.  Seth Moulton , a 2020 prospect and lock for vice presidential short lists himself, on Biden: \"I love  Joe Biden ; he has been a mentor to me and he is someone I was supporting in the primary before he decided not to run in last year's election,\" Moulton said. \"But I am someone who is actively recruiting  a new generation of Democratic leaders .

The week ahead: \u2014 Friday, November 17 \u2014  Joe Biden 's book tour swings through Washington with an 8 p.m. ET event at the Warner Theatre.  \u2014 Friday, November 17 \u2014 Reps.

Former Maryland Gov.  Martin O'Malley  launched a new political action committee called Win Back Your State PAC.

As 2018 kicks off, we'll start our weekly roundup with a quick survey of the field as it looks currently, based on which 2020 prospects are dominating headlines, making visits to early-voting states and more:  Discussion of 2020 has to start with the three potential candidates around whom the rest of the field has to strategize: Vermont Sen.  Bernie Sanders , who is still traveling the country like a candidate and would  start with a much stronger early-state organization  than he had in 2016; former Vice President  Joe Biden , who's universally known and is seen as authentic, a valuable commodity in this era; and Massachusetts Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , who is immensely popular with the progressive base and has been  carefully maneuvering  to  address her potential weaknesses .  Then there's an almost-as-prolific trio of senators who have emerged as powerful foils to the Trump administration: New York Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand , whose role in ousting Democratic Sen.  Al Franken  over sexual misconduct allegations  positioned her to lead the same charge  against President  Donald Trump ; California Sen.  Kamala Harris , who emerged as a star in her first year in office and, along with Warren and two other Democrats, just  introduced a major Wall Street oversight bill ; and New Jersey Sen.  Cory Booker , who recently made  a push for marijuana legalization  as part of his broader racial justice effort.  Some of the other prospects to watch The senators: Minnesota Sen.  Amy Klobuchar  has visited Iowa. So has Oregon Sen.  Jeff Merkley , who progressive groups credit as being an  influential behind-the-scenes organizer . Connecticut Sen.  Chris Murphy   says he's not running , but a presidential campaign would elevate his pro-gun control message. Ohio Sen.  Sherrod Brown  has a tough re-election in front of him this year, but his populist brand could work well against Trump. And Virginia Sen.  Tim Kaine  says he won't run, but if  Terry McAuliffe  doesn't, could that change?  The House members: Maryland Rep.  John Delaney  is  already in , and spends his weekends alternating between Iowa and New Hampshire trips. Rep.  Tim Ryan  of Ohio has been in Iowa and South Carolina. Massachusetts Rep.  Seth Moulton  also made an Iowa trip and has been a prolific recruiter and fundraiser this election cycle. California Rep.  Adam Schiff  has a high-profile role in the Russia probe and was recently a keynote speaker at a South Carolina Democratic event. California's  Eric Swalwell  and Hawaii's  Tulsi Gabbard  have both made recent Iowa trips, while Illinois Rep.  Luis Guti\u00e9rrez  is retiring but  could be eyeing a 2020 bid . The governors: This list has to start with outgoing Virginia Gov.  Terry McAuliffe , who is leaving office after massive Democratic victories in the campaign to replace him, and has showed more interest in the fate of the Democratic National Committee than other party leaders, recently hosting a year-end fundraiser for the party. Also on the list: two Westerners, Montana's  Steve Bullock  and Colorado's  John Hickenlooper , as well as New York Gov.  Andrew Cuomo .  Perhaps the most interesting prospect is a former Massachusetts governor:  Deval Patrick , who is beloved in  Barack Obama  world but spent the last few years working for Bain Capital. Also worth watching is California Gov.  Jerry Brown . At 79, he's older than virtually all presidential candidates \u2014 but so are Sanders and Biden. Brown has also run for the job before, and the surest indicator that a politician might run for president is having run for president before.   The mayors: New Orleans Mayor  Mitch Landrieu  recently visited South Carolina and is a well-liked figure in Democratic circles across the country. New York City Mayor  Bill de Blasio  was just in Iowa. Los Angeles Mayor  Eric Garcetti  has  publicly flirted with a 2020 run  for months. And South Bend, Indiana, Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  has been a hot commodity and made a recent Iowa trip after his failed bid for Democratic National Committee chairman a year ago.  The formers: No longer in public office themselves, at least three Democrats nonetheless could be waiting in the wings. Former Housing and Urban Development secretary  Julian Castro  is working on a book and teaching college classes in Texas right now. And former Missouri secretary of state and Senate candidate  Jason Kander  has traveled the country (including frequent trips to Iowa and New Hampshire) as part of his focus on voting rights. Former Attorney General  Eric Holder , meanwhile, is leading the Democratic redistricting effort.  The celebrities: Yes,  Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson  says he might run for president. But Democrats are taking several other prospects more seriously \u2014 particularly Starbucks CEO  Howard Schultz . Dallas Mavericks owner  Mark Cuban  talks often about the chance he might run (though he might not run as a Democrat), while Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg 's recent cross-country travels have kicked up speculation about his future.  Tom Steyer  is a player, too \u2014 keep reading for more on him. News and notes: STEYER'S 'MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT': Billionaire Democratic megadonor  Tom Steyer  \u2014 who's spent $20 million on ads calling for Trump's impeachment \u2014 plans what a press release billed as a \"major announcement\" about \"his political future and plans for 2018\" Monday morning in Washington.  Steyer has long been seen as having political ambition, and he's considered running for California governor or the Senate this year or president in 2020. For what it's worth: Campaigns for California offices generally don't launch from DC.  SANDERS REUNION IN MICHIGAN: A group of young, digital-savvy organizers who helped turn Sen.  Bernie Sanders  into an online sensation \u2014 then turned that popularity into campaign cash, packed rallies and votes \u2014 are  joining forces again, in Michigan , where Sanders scored his most stunning primary victory.  The candidate this time is  Abdul El-Sayed , a 33-year-old Rhodes scholar turned doctor and public health expert vying to become the nation's first Muslim governor. He's hired former Sanders digital organizing director  Claire Sandberg  as his deputy campaign manager and retained Middle Seat Digital, the firm founded by Sanders digital director  Kenneth Pennington  and social media lead  Hector Sigala .  Winnie Wong , co-founder of People for Bernie, the online group that popularized the #feelthebern hashtag, has come on as a consultant to the growing campaign. Victory for El-Sayed, who has seven months to catch up to front-runner  Gretchen Whitmer , would give added juice to Sanders' 2020 prospects and confirm the strength of his potential campaign-in-waiting.  2020 PROSPECTS HIT SESSIONS ON MARIJUANA: Attorney General  Jeff Sessions ' move to  reverse Obama-era rules  that left states that had legalized pot alone drew swift rebukes from Democratic 2020 prospects. \"This is a destructive decision and a huge step backwards,\" said Oregon Sen.  Jeff Merkley . \"Whatever happened to Attorney General Sessions' belief in states' rights?\" California Sen.  Kamala Harris   tweeted : \"Instead of going after drug cartels, and violent crime, and major traffickers, Attorney General  Jeff Sessions  is going after recreational marijuana users. That's not being smart on crime.\"  One notable line from New York Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand 's response: \"Veterans should be able to come home from combat and use the medicine they need without having to fear they will be prosecuted.\"  RYAN COY ABOUT 2020: One we missed late last year: MSNBC's  Chris Matthews  asked Ohio Rep.  Tim Ryan  directly if he's running for president in 2020. \" I don't know if I am ,\" Ryan responded.  DE BLASIO'S EVOLVING ALLIANCES: From the department of \"my, how much things have changed,\" New York City Mayor  Bill de Blasio  \u2014 who  slipped in a trip to Iowa before New Year's  \u2014 was  sworn in for his second term  on January 1 by  Bernie Sanders . Former President  Bill Clinton  did the same job at his first inauguration, in 2014.  \"I have immense respect for what (Sanders) has done,\" de Blasio said. \"He's single-handedly changed discussion in this country. No one has shined the light on the question of income inequality more than  Bernie Sanders , and he's changed the way that politics will be approached in this country going forward.\" Before you go: California Sen.  Kamala Harris  will be this year's  grand marshal  of the annual Kingdom Day Parade, the massive Los Angeles parade held on  Martin Luther King Jr.  Day. ... South Bend, Indiana, Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  announced in  a Facebook post  on December 28 that he and his boyfriend,  Chasten Glezman , are engaged. ... Massachusetts Sen.  Elizabeth Warren  had to postpone a town hall in Quincy that was set for Friday night \u2014 for good reason: With a winter storm hitting the area, the high school that was set to host it is being used as an emergency shelter.

Elizabeth Warren   took a side  in the Democratic Party's roiling divide over 2016 \u2014 and set the terms for moving past it \u2014 with her one-word answer when CNN's  Jake Tapper  asked Thursday afternoon whether the primary was, in her view, rigged against  Bernie Sanders .  \"Yes.\"  She was responding to former Democratic National Committee interim chair  Donna Brazile 's book excerpt  published by Politico  alleging that  Hillary Clinton  had secretly taken over the party long before becoming the nominee.  \"This is a real problem,\" Warren said. \"But what we've got to do as Democrats now is we've got to hold this party accountable. When  Tom Perez  was first elected chair of the DNC, the very first conversation I had with him is to say, 'You have got to put together a Democratic Party in which everybody can have confidence the party is working for Democrats, rather than Democrats are working for the party.' And he's being tested now. This is a test for  Tom Perez . And either he's going to succeed by bringing  Bernie Sanders  and Bernie Sanders representatives into this process, and they're going to say 'It's fair, it works, we all believe it' \u2014 or he's going to fail. And I very much hope he succeeds.\"  Thursday was not a good day for Democratic unity. The morning began with Brazile's bombshell \u2014 which led Sanders' political organization Our Revolution to send an email blast with the subject line \"It was rigged all along.\" It ended with the  Howard Dean -founded Democracy For America lambasting Virginia gubernatorial candidate  Ralph Northam 's campaign as \"racist,\" which led to Dean himself lashing out at the group he'd founded. And in between all that, Perez fired his finance director,  Emily Mellencamp Smith , after five months on the job. A Senate Democratic campaign veteran who'd worked with Mellencamp Smith called, furious, to say \"she was the most functioning thing they had there\" and \"the best person the DNC was going to get.\" It was, however, a notable week for Warren \u2014 the progressive hero who was back to sparring with President  Donald Trump  on Twitter Friday morning. (Trump  called Warren \"Pocahontas\"  again; Warren shot back that Trump's tweets \"won't stop ( Robert )  Mueller 's investigation or  keep your people out of jail .\")  She also made news by becoming the second Democrat, after California Sen.  Kamala Harris , to say she'll oppose a budget deal if Congress hasn't extended protections for those previously covered by former President  Barack Obama 's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or \"DACA\") program, which Trump is rescinding.  News and notes: BIDEN CALLS TRUMP A 'CHARLATAN':  Former Vice President  Joe Biden  ripped into Trump on Wednesday, calling Trump a \"charlatan\" at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs. \"Ladies and gentlemen, silence is complicity,\" Biden said. \"I will continue to stand up and speak out.\" More Biden: \"How many of you now, whether you voted for him or not, are beginning to wonder if the roots, the invisible moral fabric that holds everything up, is eroding in a way that's dangerous for democratic institutions? If we don't stand up, the liberal world order we championed will quickly become an illiberal world order we suffer.\"  Politico's Edward-Isaac Dovere has more .  \u2014 Some Biden 2020 watch news Friday morning: He filmed a 33-second home video for  Joyce Craig , the Democratic candidate for mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire.  Watch it here . Biden had previously cut  a video  for eight Democratic candidates for judgeships in Pennsylvania.  \u2014 Biden isn't slowing down his efforts to work toward an end to cancer. On Wednesday, Biden will be  speaking at an event put on by Axios  titled Future Shapers: A New Era in Cancer Innovation at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. He'll be joined by his wife,  Jill Biden , along with oncologists, cancer survivors and others working towards the same goal of ending cancer. RYAN, MOULTON, DELANEY TO NEW HAMPSHIRE:  Ohio Rep.  Tim Ryan  is heading to New Hampshire this Saturday to serve as the keynote speaker at the Manchester City Democrats Countdown to Victory Dinner. This will be his second trip to the first-in-the-nation primary state, before making a third later this month when he and Maryland Rep.  John Delaney  will both speak at the 2017 Kennedy Clinton Dinner in Manchester on November 17. Delaney, the only announced Democratic presidential candidate for 2020, has visited the Granite State several times since announcing his candidacy in July.  Also in New Hampshire  this weekend : Massachusetts Rep.  Seth Moulton , who will campaign for young Democratic candidates in Nashua alongside  Colin Van Ostern , the party's 2016 nominee for governor.  MCAULIFFE 2020?  On this week's edition of The Axe Files podcast with  David Axelrod , Virginia Gov.  Terry McAuliffe  was  asked whether he harbors any aspirations  of seeking the highest political office when he ends his term next year. McAuliffe said he has \"no idea\" what he'll be doing in 2020. He said he plans to travel to support Democratic gubernatorial candidates, saying his focus is squarely on the 2018 races.  \"It drives me wild when Democrats talk about 2020. Because if we don't have a successful night in 2018, and we're going to get redistricted ... our party and the principles we care about are going to get wiped out,\" he said. However, when pressed about whether he would rule out a run, McAuliffe said he'd \"never rule anything out.\" \u2014 McAuliffe has a lot on the line in Tuesday's gubernatorial election in Virginia. Virginia's economy is strong, with sub-4% unemployment, and voters there broadly say the state is on the right track while they say the nation is on the wrong track. A  Ralph Northam  win would also be a validator of McAuliffe's legacy.  DON'T COUNT O'MALLEY OUT:   FiveThirtyEight's Seth Masket  had an interesting take on  Martin O'Malley 's potential as a 2020 contender. The former governor of Maryland has endorsed a 2018 gubernatorial candidate in Iowa and continues to make visits to the three early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. O'Malley spent more time in Iowa than either  Hillary Clinton  or  Bernie Sanders  before the 2016 election, but garnered less than 1% of the caucus vote. His visits to the Hawkeye State haven't slowed, however. He's among the most active potential 2020 candidates in terms of visiting three early-contest states and courting activists there. Masket writes: \"O'Malley is operating in the McGovern\/Carter model, betting that party elite control is dead or under great duress right now and that his strategy will work better in 2020 than it did in 2016. This is not an unreasonable gamble.\"  KAINE ADDRESSES SEXISM:  Virginia Sen.  Tim Kaine ,  Hillary Clinton 's 2016 running mate,  wrote an op-ed in Esquire magazine  this week calling on men to join the fight to ensure equal opportunity for women. He described how he was enthused to join Clinton on the trail as her running mate, but the sexism he saw directed towards Clinton demonstrated that men have a ways to go. \"The attitudes toward Hillary that we saw on the trail \u2014 the 'lock her up' chants, the 'Killary' and 'Shrillary' memes, the proliferation of bogus conspiracy theories and vulgar attacks \u2014 showed how far away American men are from respecting women and accepting our own role in combating sexism,\" Kaine wrote. The week ahead: Tuesday, November 7 \u2014 Election Day. Democrats will be watching the Virginia and New Jersey governor's races, and hope to win a Washington state senate seat that would give the party unified control of the government there. Down-ballot races for the Virginia state assembly, as well as for lieutenant governor and attorney general, will also get attention.  Wednesday, November 8 \u2014  Joe Biden  attends an event on ending cancer hosted by Axios. It's at 3:30 p.m. ET at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.  Before you go:  The frugal Vermont Sen.  Bernie Sanders  used to cook  over toilet paper Sterno , he told NBC's  Seth Meyers . ... Minnesota Sen.  Al Franken  told Attorney General  Jeff Sessions  he \" failed to tell the truth \" about his Russian interactions during the campaign. ... New York Gov.

Few examples back up this piece of advice like Donald Trump's reaction to his 2016 second place finish in the Iowa caucuses, which happened on this day in 2016.  In  one of the last polls  before the first in the nation 2016 Iowa caucuses, then-candidate Trump had a five-point lead over Sen. Ted Cruz. In  what should have been foreshadowing  for that year's general election, the polls didn't predict what happened next.  Cruz ended up winning  the state by a little more than three points. But Trump didn't let that setback get him down. ( Couldn't say the same for Mike Huckabee. ) In the Instagram video above, you can see future President Trump react to his loss.    \"We will go on to get the Republican nomination. And we will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie or whoever the hell they throw up there,\" Trump said.  Trump went on to easily  win the New Hampshire primary  and, eventually, the  Republican nomination . So half of his February prediction was true.  Would I call the  2016 general election  an \"easy\" victory? As we know, he did really well in the Electoral College, beating Clinton 306-232. Clinton beat him by two points in the popular vote.  It wasn't an early night  for anyone, that's for sure. But he won. He is President. Just like he said he'd be two years ago.  Really, this was only two years ago.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., lose his party leadership post for hugging President Trump. Most Democrats quickly left the House chamber after the president\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. But Machin, one of the Senate's few moderate lawmakers and the vice chairman of the Policy and Communications Committee, lingered. As President Trump made his way towards the exit, he stopped to give Manchin a hug, handshake and a pat on the back. Not only that, but during Trump\u2019s speech Manchin gave a standing ovation when the he spoke about ending Obama-era regulations impacting the coal mining, which is paramount to the West Virginia economy. And then the following day, Manchin praised the speech on Capitol Hill. \u00a0 \u201cI loved the presidential tone,\u201d Manchin said Wednesday. \u201cThe tone was good \u2014 it was exactly what we needed to hear.\u201d But Thursday several liberal groups, like CREDO, #AllOfUs, Democracy for America, Other98 and 350 Action, gathered in the Hart Senate Building, with their boxes of signatures, calling Manchin a \u201cphony Democrat.\u201d In this March 29, 2011, file photo Senate Armed Services Committee member Sen.

Some of that may be wishful thinking by Stutzman, who has long been a vocal member of the \"Never Trump\" wing of the Republican Party. After all, there's no modern example of a primary challenge to a sitting president working. Ronald Reagan lost -- albeit barely -- to Gerald Ford in 1976. Ted Kennedy lost to Jimmy Carter in 1980. Pat Buchanan lost to George H.W. Bush in 1992. (Note: The primary challenges did not work, but none of the presidents listed above went on to re-election.) At the same time, Trump may well be uniquely vulnerable to a primary challenge given his dismal approval ratings, his lack of connections to the major donors in the GOP and the fact that many Republican establishment types never wanted him to be their nominee in the first place. In other words: A path  does  exist for a serious primary challenge to Trump if he stays on, roughly, the course he is currently on.   So, who might be the one to step forward to take Trump on? Here's a look at the five most likely contenders (listed in alphabetical order) : *  Ted Cruz : It's hard to imagine anyone disliking Trump more than Cruz. The Texas senator has to withstand  Trump's attack on his wife's looks  and the suggestion from the party's eventual nominee that  Cruz's father might have been involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy . Cruz also drew massive headlines when  he pointedly refused to endorse Trump  at the Republican National Convention despite being handed a plum speaking spot. ( He endorsed Trump two months later. ) Cruz is up for a second term in November 2018 and Democrats have recruited a real challenger against him in the form of Rep. Beto O'Rourke. But this is Texas in a midterm election so Cruz should be fine. And a solid 2018 victory could well lend momentum for Cruz to just keep running. *  Jeff Flake : The Arizona Republican senator is getting lots of attention for  his forthcoming book in which he lambastes Trump for the chaos created in the White House and scolds his own party for going along with it all . Flake is now positioned as the conservative conscience of the party, someone not willing to bend to the latest political winds just because it's the path of least resistance. Flake has some work to do before he can even begin to consider a 2020 bid, however. He's up for re-election in 2018 and  Trump has already spoken personally with three potential primary challengers to him . Democrats are also eyeballing the seat which Trump won by 3.5 points in 2016.  *  John Kasich : The Ohio governor was the highest-profile holdout on Trump during the 2016 election. And since Trump's victory, Kasich has remained vocal in his opposition to Trump's bare-knuckled approach. He's also been consistently offering an alternative strategy -- one based on bringing people together around common-sense solutions and working to take some of the heat out of our politics. In May, Kasich said this about a 2020 bid in an  interview with HBO's Bill Maher : \"I'm going to finish my term in 18 months as governor of our state, pull the state together and get it to do better and better and better. That's what I'm all about \u2014 and giving everybody a shot. And then I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm going to keep a voice, but I can't predict to you \u2014 I never thought I would be governor, I never thought I'd go back into politics.\" All of which is definitely not a hard \"no.\" *  Ben Sasse : The Nebraska senator is only in his first term but  has already made a name for himself thanks to his willingness to critique Trump . Sasse has been outspoken in condemning some of Trump's more crude comments -- about, for example, MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski -- and has  written a book  about the shrinking moral fabric of the country and what it means for young people.

Across the map, in mayoral contests, state legislative races and ballot measures, everything broke Democrats' way. \u00a0\u00a0 Republicans will wake up Wednesday in a nightmare: All of a sudden, full control of Congress might be in serious jeopardy. Trump's low approval ratings look toxic. And it could be much harder to convince incumbents to run -- and to recruit candidates into open-seat races -- in such a difficult environment.\u00a0\u00a0 Here are five takeaways from Democrats' big day: 1. The blue wave Democrats won races large and small Tuesday, starting with the New Jersey and Virginia governor's races.\u00a0 The party won hotly contested mayoral races in Charlotte, North Carolina, and St. Petersburg, Florida. In Maine, voters approved a ballot measure to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0\u00a0 In Virginia,\u00a0Northam didn't just beat Republican Ed Gillespie in the northern Virginia suburbs -- he crushed him.\u00a0Consider Loudoun County near Washington: Democrats won it by 5 points in the 2013 governor's race, and 20 points on Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0 Democrats were also within striking distance of flipping the 17 seats they needed to take the Virginia House of Delegates -- giving the party much more influence on redistricting in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0 It all gives Democrats a huge psychological boost that could help their fundraising and candidate recruitment. It could also accelerate the pace of Republican retirements, as Republican Bob McDonnell's win in the 2009 Virginia governor's race did for Democrats. Already on Tuesday, New Jersey Republican Rep. Frank LoBiondo announced his retirement -- creating another toss-up seat. There could soon be more.\u00a0 2. Trumpism without Trump didn't work Gillespie and Trump didn't campaign together. But Gillespie tried just about every trick in Trump's bag.\u00a0\u00a0 His television ads portrayed Northam as enabling the MS-13 gang by being soft on immigration enforcement. He picked up on Trump's culture wars, hitting NFL players for kneeling during the National Anthem and promising to keep Virginia's Confederate monuments up.\u00a0\u00a0 It was all an effort to convince Trump voters to turn out for a former lobbyist and George W. Bush aide.\u00a0\u00a0 It failed.\u00a0\u00a0 Gillespie did well in rural Virginia. But the Democratic base that slumbered through 2016 turned out in full force and the suburbs shifted dramatically in Northam's favor.\u00a0 \"Virginia sent a strong message that Trump-style division -- pitting people against people -- that is not the Virginia way. That is not the American way,\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said at Northam's victory party.\u00a0 Trump tried to lay the blame solely at Gillespie's feet, tweeting, \"Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don't forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!\"\u00a0\u00a0 Now, Republicans have to confront the possibility that they'll face the same problem Democrats faced during the presidency of Barack Obama: His popularity doesn't transfer to them.\u00a0\u00a0 Trump campaigned in Alabama for Sen. Luther Strange -- who promptly lost a Republican primary to former judge Roy Moore. He recorded a robocall and tweeted for Gillespie, who was walloped in what both sides expected to be a close race. Trump voters turn out for Trump -- but so far, no one else.\u00a0\u00a0 3. Republicans lost the culture war Beyond the governor's race, Democrats won a decisive victory on the social and cultural issues that have dominated Virginia politics.\u00a0\u00a0 Democrat Danica Roem became the only openly transgender state lawmaker in America. She beat Bob Marshall, who had advocated for a bill restricting which bathrooms transgender people could use.\u00a0\u00a0 One of the biggest forces in the Virginia races was Planned Parenthood, which helped Democrats defeat a Republican lieutenant governor nominee, Jill Vogel, who as a state senator had pushed a bill requiring women seeking abortions to undergo vaginal ultrasounds.\u00a0\u00a0 And in the Virginia attorney general's race, incumbent Democrat Mark Herring cruised despite Republican John Adams' attacks on Herring's decision not to defend the state's same-sex marriage ban in court.\u00a0\u00a0 To be sure, Northam was hobbled by Gillespie's MS-13 ad. He appeared to flip-flop at the last minute and said he opposed sanctuary cities -- a decision that appeared to be out of desperation. In other states with less Democratic voters, his stumbles could have led to a loss.\u00a0\u00a0 But up and down the ticket, the GOP focus on social issues proved costly Tuesday in Virginia.\u00a0\u00a0 4. Obama and Biden help Democrats The Democratic Party lost about 1,000 state legislative seats during Obama's presidency across the country -- eight years in which Democratic strategists howled about the White House's inattention to the party's crumbling infrastructure and its down-ballot disasters.\u00a0 Now out of office, Obama and Biden both focused on 2017 races. And it turned out the two made pretty effective Democratic surrogates.\u00a0\u00a0 Biden-endorsed candidates were on course for a clean sweep. And Obama's rallies in New Jersey and Virginia, which drew thousands to hear his lectures that the party's base had gotten \"complacent\" in non-presidential elections, appear to have energized the minority voters that Northam's campaign had worried might stay at home. While the northern Virginia results will get the most national attention, Northam ran up his lead throughout Virginia's entire urban crescent -- stretching from the Washington suburbs through Norfolk.\u00a0\u00a0 Both Obama and Biden are showing an appetite to play surrogate roles in 2018. Biden has already waded into December's Alabama Senate special election, and has done nothing to tamp down speculation that he might run for president in 2020. They'll be the most sought-after Democratic surrogates over the next year.\u00a0\u00a0 5. McAuliffe 2020 starts now The happiest person in Virginia might be Gov. Terry McAuliffe.\u00a0\u00a0 The long-time friend of the Clintons, fundraiser extraordinaire and former Democratic National Committee chairman wasn't taken particularly seriously as a candidate himself -- a principal, rather than a supporting player -- when he ran for governor in 2013.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, McAuliffe seems impossible to ignore.\u00a0\u00a0 Swaggering onto stage at Northam's victory party to Mark Morrison's \"Return of the Mack,\" McAuliffe cast the election results as Virginia's rejection of discrimination. He touted his own administration's efforts to protect LGBT workers, in a message that sounded 2020-ready.\u00a0\u00a0 A few weeks from leaving office, McAuliffe has made clear that he hasn't run out of political ambition. He leaves Virginia as a popular Democrat with a strong economic record and a revitalized Democratic bench set to take office.\u00a0","articles_date":"8 11 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/11\/07\/politics\/5-takeaways-election-virginia-governor-trump\/index.html","articles_title":"5 takeaways from the Democrats' big night","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":12,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) The news was splashy:  Texas Democratic Senate nominee Beto O'Rourke raked in almost $7 million  in the first three months of 2018 in his (still) uphill challenge against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. Excitement over O'Rourke's candidacy has been bubbling just below the surface for Democrats in Texas and Washington for a few months now, with optimism built, largely, on O'Rourke's fundraising ability and  President Donald Trump's surprisingly unimpressive poll numbers in the Lone Star State . Still, that optimism has been guarded -- largely because Democrats have been promising since at least 2002 that  this  is the election where the changing face of Texas -- less white, more Hispanic -- gives them a real chance to win a statewide election. That optimism may be less guarded in the wake of this massive fundraising haul by O'Rourke.  But, raising oodles of money doesn't guarantee an O'Rourke win. (If money = victory, then Tony Sanchez would have been governor and Ron Kirk would be in the Senate.  They aren't .) While O'Rourke's cash haul doesn't prove he's a sure-fire winner, it does reveal a few things about the race. Here are five. 1. Democratic donors hate Cruz : Sure, O'Rourke is young, personable and handsome.  And, yes, Texas is a big state with  lots and lots of donor money in it . But, a good chunk of O'Rourke's cash is the result of donors -- inside and outside of Texas -- who simply want to make Cruz sweat. Other than the current occupant of the White House, there's no Republican who Democrats hate more than Cruz -- largely as a result of his near-miss 2016 presidential campaign. That Cruz hatred among Democratic givers doesn't take away anything from O'Rourke; he saw the opportunity to run and capitalize on that dislike before anyone else did. 2. O'Rourke has a much higher $$$ ceiling : The $6.7 million O'Rourke raised between January 1 and March 31 came from 141,000 donations. Some simple back of the envelope math means that the average contribution was around $50. (Obviously that's a broad estimate, not a hard-and-fast number.)  What it means is that O'Rourke should be able to go back to lots and lots of his donors and ask for more. (The contribution limit for an individual is $2,700 for the primary and another $2,700 for the general election.) The more he looks like he can be truly competitive, the easier that ask becomes. 3. PAC money is overrated : When O'Rourke announced his candidacy, he pledged not to accept any donations from political action committees -- a move aimed at proving he wasn't part of the DC swamp. Most independent observers crushed him for that decision, insisting that the residual benefits he would get from being able to cast himself as un-owned by the permanent political class would be overshadowed by how much money he would be sacrificing. (Cruz has raised north of $580,000 from PACs.)  Turns out that O'Rourke hasn't needed PAC cash at all. 4. O'Rourke isn't a creation of the national Democratic Party:  Per point No. 1, there's a tendency to assume that for any Democrat to raise the amount of money O'Rourke has that it must be coming from wealthy liberals on the two coasts who have cash to burn and just want to make Cruz's life difficult. Not so, at least as of February 18, the last day for which we have detailed information on O'Rourke's cash flow. (O'Rourke announced his fundraising through March 31 via press release but the actual report, which gives us a more detailed sense of where the money came from -- and how much of it he has left -- has yet to show up at the Federal Election Commission.)  As of that date, 49.99% of O'Rourke's donations came from inside of Texas with the remainder from outside the state. That's a healthy split that suggests O'Rourke is not simply a creation of national Democrats but has actual, on-the-ground support among Texans. 5. This is a real race : Make no mistake: Cruz is still the favorite here. Texas remains a Republican state and despite what is expected to be a very good year for Democrats nationally, any credible GOPer starts with an edge over a Democrat in this state. That said, O'Rourke's fundraising will allow him to build a real voter identification and turnout effort statewide as well as battle Cruz on the TV airwaves. That doesn't guarantee victory. But it almost always ensures competitiveness.","articles_date":"3 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/03\/politics\/beto-orourke-ted-cruz-fundraising-texas\/index.html","articles_title":"5 things Beto O'Rourke's eye-popping fundraising reveals ","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":13,"issue":8,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday further strained an already tense relationship with President Barack Obama. And a number of top Democrats \u2014\u00a0including Vice President Joe Biden, whose job description includes the title President of the Senate  \u2014\u00a0didn't attend. READ: Netanyahu: Deal will pave way to Iranian nuclear bomb Netanyahu used the Tuesday speech to frame Iran as a major terrorist threat to the U.S and Israel, framing it in the same vein as ISIS and North Korea. And he argued that the deal currently in the works to prevent the nation from gaining nuclear weapons would in fact \"guarantee\" that it secures them \u2014 \"lots of them.\"  The expected substance of the speech, coupled with the fact that the White House was not alerted to the invite ahead of time, had drawn sharp criticism from the administration, and Democrats crying foul. National Security Adviser Susan Rice last week said Netanyahu's decision to speak was \"destructive to the fabric of the relationship\" between Israel and the U.S. Related: White House gets confrontational before Netanyahu visit   At least 50 Democratic House members and eight senators who caucus with the Democrats said in recent weeks they wouldn't attend the speech, many in protest to a move that they say is an affront to the president.

But a week earlier, Virginia Democrats will choose their party's gubernatorial nominee -- a primary race that may ultimately tell us more about the national playing field and the state of the Democratic party than the contest in Georgia or anywhere else. At root, the race in Virginia mirrors the unfinished fight of the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries between the pragmatic establishment and the ideological left. In 2016, that was Hillary Clinton versus Bernie Sanders. In 2017, it's Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam versus former Rep. Tom Perriello. Northam started the race with a clear headstart -- financially and organizationally.  As the sitting lieutenant governor, he had much of the backing of the party establishment; Terry McAuliffe, the sitting governor, Tim Kaine, the last governor and now a senator, and Mark Herring, the Commonwealth's Attorney General  all endorsed Northam  last year. That trio of endorsements was meant to be a show of force that closed out the possibility of a Perriello candidacy -- or a run by anyone else. But as we saw in the Clinton-Sanders fight, the establishment's ability to dictate its wishes to its base is very, very limited. Perriello ran relentlessly to Northam's left, casting himself as the candidate of the Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wing of the party. In fact,  Perriello's closing ad  -- released Monday -- features Warren delivering an extended testimonial to Perriello's commitment \"to make change, not for the richest or the most powerful, but....to make this economy work better for hard-working families.\" And, it's working. In a  Washington Post poll  conducted in mid-May, Perriello was at 40 percent to 38 percent for Northam.   If you needed more evidence, just check out how the message Northam has settled on in the race.   Northam began running  ads in early May  in which he, as a doctor, offers this \"diagnosis\" of President Trump: \"I've been listening carefully to Donald Trump and I think he's a narcissistic maniac.\" WHAT!   Calling Trump names is one thing. But offering a diagnosis of his psychiatric state feels like something different to me.  The lesson here is a simple one: It's impossible to be \"too\" anti-Trump for Democrats at the moment. Short of p osing with a fake Trump head in your hand , Democrats are ready to believe and get behind virtually any negative assessment of his presidency. The more negative, the better.  If Perriello wins next Tuesday, that should be the takeaway for every Democrat running in a primary race between now and next fall.  The question going forward will be how hard Perriello would go at likely GOP nominee Ed Gillespie over Trump in the general election. My guess? Very hard. And, if Perriello wins on  that  message, Democrats across the country will take it as a blueprint for how to regain their footholds not just in Congress but in governor's mansions around the U.S.: Blast Trump -- and blast him hard.","articles_date":"5 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/05\/politics\/tom-perriello-ralph-northam-virginia\/index.html","articles_title":"A Virginia Democrat called Trump a 'narcissistic maniac.'

In recent months, CHIP -- a program that has existed for two decades and is a rare, bipartisan bright spot on Capitol Hill -- has been mired in uncertainty.  The program even got a mention Tuesday night by Sen.-elect Doug Jones, a Democrat, who next month will fill a US Senate seat from Alabama. \"Take this opportunity in light of this election and go ahead and fund that CHIP program before I get up there,\" Jones issued as a challenge to his \"future colleagues\" during his victory speech. \"Put it aside and let's do it for those million kids and 150,000 here in Birmingham, Alabama.\" The program ran out of federal funding on September 30. In the months that followed, states cobbled together money to keep their programs running, and when that became precarious for some states Congress acted last week to create a temporary patch for the program that would make it easier for states to keep their programs afloat until the end of the year. Even then, however, some states have been forced to send out letters alerting parents that the funding for a program that millions of kids depend on could end if Congress doesn't act. RELATED: CHIP funding is latest victim of DC dysfunction Republicans and Democrats say they are still negotiating a final resolution for CHIP, and Republicans are emphatic that the program will not cease to exist despite the impassioned monologues from the likes of Kimmel.  But the program -- first authored by late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts and Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah (and with the support of then-first-lady Hillary Clinton) -- has failed to escape the hyper-partisan climate.  Senate Republicans say the delay on CHIP is merely a result of the fact that the Senate and House are still negotiating a year-end spending bill. \"There hasn't been any agreement on spending caps so it's pushed all of this to the end of the year, to the 22nd,\" said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican. \"Unfortunately it looks like we may get kicked over the January before all of this can get done ... but there's a lot of different pieces riding on that year-end and now maybe first of the year deal and unfortunately it's delayed everything.\" Parents to Congress: My child depends on CHIP for health insurance Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that Republicans are so concerned about their tax overhaul that they've forsaken CHIP, pushed it off until after they've ensured they have the votes to pass their priority legislation. They've accused Republicans of trying to use health insurance program as a bargaining chip in year-end spending negotiations. \"I think the holdup is that Republicans want to dangle it as if they're not going to do it to try to extract a concession,\" said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia. \"We got the votes for it. All it does is terrorize parents right before Christmas and make them worry about whether their kid will lose health insurance, which is so stupid.\" In recent weeks and before Kimmel, CHIP has emerged as a kind of political token. It was the center of another high-profile scuffle in November when Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown accused Hatch, the Senate Finance Committee chairman, of not caring about CHIP, which led Hatch to remind Brown that \"I was the one who wrote it.\" \"No one believes more in the CHIP than I,\" Hatch said. \"I invented it.\" Principals on both sides acknowledge they'll be a resolution to CHIP in upcoming weeks. Hatch told reporters Tuesday that Congress would get the job done and top Democrat on the Finance Committee Ron Wyden of Oregon said he was \"continuing\" \"discussions\" with Hatch. \"If I had my way, this bill would have passed many many weeks ago,\" Wyden said. But the fact remains that getting to a resolution has meant that a program that was once a gem of bipartisanship has become a political football. \"Most everything has gotten polarized and politicized in this town so I'm not terribly surprised,\" said Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania. \"My guess is it gets reauthorized.\"","articles_date":"13 12 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/12\/13\/politics\/kimmel-childrens-health-insurance-program-latest\/index.html","articles_title":"After Kimmel, here's where the CHIP program stands","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":17,"issue":2,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Two senators determined to pass a short-term Obamacare fix are making it clear that they will forge ahead -- with or without President Donald Trump's explicit backing. Sens. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, and Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, showed no signs Thursday of giving up on a new bipartisan bill that would guarantee the payment of a critical Obamacare subsidy for two years, despite Trump's sharp criticism their proposal just the day before.  Trump again muddied the waters Thursday afternoon, saying he still wants a long-term reform of the national health care system, but didn't explicitly oppose a short-term measure proposed by Alexander and Murray. The senators unveiled a list of bold-faced names as co-sponsors in the hopes of winning broader support from various corners of the Senate and turning around the seemingly tenuous fate of their legislation..  The new Republican backers include Sens. John McCain, Richard Burr, Joni Ernst, Lindsay Graham, Bob Corker, Bill Cassidy and Lisa Murkowski. Among the Democrats backing the plan are Sens. Claire McCaskill, Al Franken, Amy Klobuchar, Heidi Heitkamp and Tammy Baldwin.  Alexander also revealed that he had spoken -- for the second time in one day -- with Trump Wednesday evening, and that the President had \"encouraged the process\" that the senator was pursuing.  \"He said he looks forward to considering it, and I said, 'If you have suggestions for improving it, that's certainly your prerogative to do,'\" Alexander said at a committee hearing Thursday.  Alexander again emphasized that it was the President himself who had personally encouraged the senator to seek a bipartisan deal. \"I appreciate the President's encouragement to create a short-term bipartisan solution and his willingness to consider it,\" he said. Despite the senator's optimistic tone, the bipartisan health care deal appears not far from the brink of collapse -- in no small part because of Trump. Trump all over the place -- again Trump appeared to once again signal that he may support the bipartisan legislation.  Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Thursday, the President indicated he would support the legislation as a \"short term solution,\" but also once again emphasized that any legislation that boosts insurance companies would be unacceptable.   \"We will probably like a very short term solution until we hit the block grants,\" Trump said, referring to his ultimate goal of replacing Obamacare with a plan that includes a block grant system for Medicaid.  \"I like people working on plans all the time,\" Trump said. \"Anything they're working on will be short term. It will absolutely be short term. ... Because ultimately it's going to be repeal and replace.\" Ultimately, here's where he landed: \"If they can do something like that I'm open to it but I don't want it to be at the expense of the people. I want to take care of our people, I don't want to take care of the insurance companies.\" It was the latest in a series of course reversals that Trump has made on the Alexander-Murray deal in the span of a few days.  When the framework of the plan was initially announced, Trump called it a short-term \"solution\" and said that the White House had been involved in crafting it.  But soon after, Trump tweeted that he could \"never support bailing out\" insurance companies -- dealing a sudden blow to the bill. The President's zigzag had much to do with the  pushback he received from aides and conservatives , multiple sources said.  One conservative leader who spoke with top White House officials this week to share his strong opposition to the Alexander-Murray deal said he didn't mince words -- and warned that if Congress passes the bill, \"it would be a grenade going off on tax reform.\" Angering key conservative lawmakers like Sens. Ted Cruz or Mike Lee would be a \"debacle,\" this person conveyed to White House officials, and would have a domino effect of badly hurting the GOP's ability to do anything substantial going forward, including tax reform.  In his conversation with White House officials, this person also put heavy emphasis on how Alexander-Murray would anger conservatives.  \"Boy, you talk about further inflaming the base. ... Not keeping the word to the base on repealing Obamacare, and if you then work with 48 Democrats in the Senate to give billions of dollars in subsidies to keep Obamacare markets operating -- can you imagine how the base would react to them?\" the person said.  For now, GOP leaders have not indicated that there would be a vote on Alexander-Murray -- some have gone so far as to suggest that the legislation was as good as dead.  \"At the moment it looks like everything has stalled out,\" Sen. John Thune, the third highest ranking Republican in the Senate, said Wednesday. \"So we'll see \u200ewhere it goes from here, if there's a will to kind of put it together and see if there's a path forward.\" CNN's Phil Mattingly and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.","articles_date":"19 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/19\/politics\/alexander-murray-health-care-trump\/index.html","articles_title":"Alexander, Murray press forward on health care -- with or without Trump","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":18,"issue":2,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"POWELLTON, W.Va. \u2014 Deep in the belly of an Appalachian mountain, a powerful machine bored into the earth, its whirring teeth clawing out a stream of glistening coal. Men followed inside the Maple Eagle No. 1 mine, their torches cutting through the dank air. One guided the machine with a PlayStation-like controller; others bolted supports in the freshly cut roof. They were angry. The coal industry that made West Virginia prosperous has been devastated. Every day, it seemed, another mine laid off workers or closed entirely. Friends were forfeiting their cars, homes and futures. For these men, this season\u2019s presidential campaign boils down to a single choice. \u201cI\u2019m for Trump,\u201d said Dwayne Riston, 27, his face smeared in dust. \u201cWay I see it, if he wins, we might at least stand a chance of surviving.\u201d Few places in America offer such a simple electoral calculus as the rolling, tree-studded hills of West Virginia. Even as  Donald J. Trump , the Republican presidential nominee, lags badly in crucial swing states and  loses his grip on white male voters over all , he remains on solid ground here with  his promise  to \u201cbring back coal.\u201d The fact that his Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton,  said in March , \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,\u201d has helped, too. But this is not just about economics. West Virginia\u2019s coal country is part of the broader white, working-class vote that has coalesced around a single candidate, Mr. Trump, like never before. His support here stems from a profound, decades-in-the-making sense of  political and cultural alienation  that has left people feeling distant from their leaders, and even from fellow Americans. \u201cI kind of feel that people are looking down on us,\u201d said Neil Hanshew, a miner, voicing a common sentiment. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at us like we\u2019re a bunch of dumb hillbillies who can\u2019t do anything else.\u201d I found my way to the Maple Eagle No. 1 mine after I met the mine manager at a church in Mingo County, famed as the center of the  Hatfield-McCoy feud  more than a century ago, when rival clan members battled it out along the border with Kentucky. This is not my regular beat \u2014 I\u2019m usually reporting on the Arab world as The New York Times\u2019s bureau chief in Cairo, but I have come to the United States for a few months to  cover this unusual campaign  from a foreigner\u2019s perspective. After Mr. Trump\u2019s  combative nominating convention  in Cleveland and  Mrs. Clinton\u2019s coronation  in Philadelphia, I hit the road to explore how the campaign themes were playing out on the ground. Mingo County, a picturesque district of twisting valleys, is steeped in the lore of coal, corruption and violence. A gun battle between mine company officials and unionized workers in 1920 brought the nickname \u201cBloody Mingo,\u201d fodder today for history tourists and TV serials. I checked into a hotel in the county seat, Williamson, where the manager offered a run-down of the area\u2019s more recent dramas. In 2013, the county sheriff  was murdered   as he ate lunch  in his patrol car. A year later, a senior judge  was jailed on corruption charges  (\u201cFolks knew him as \u2018the king,\u2019\u201d the manager said). More recently, the local coal magnate, Donald L. Blankenship, started  a one-year prison sentence  for breaching safety standards at a mine where 29 miners died in an accident in 2010. And in May, a wealthy coal executive was  fatally shot  in the town cemetery as he visited his wife\u2019s grave. A pair of drug addicts have been arrested. Williamson itself, a town of 3,000, is a picture of social and economic decay. Unemployment, at 12 percent, is more than twice the United States average. Cash-for-gold stores crowd alongside lawyers\u2019 offices and gun dealerships. Rates of heroin overdoses and obesity are among the highest in America. Many residents scrape by on food stamps. In the surrounding hills, abandoned coal mines hum with the noise of ventilation pumps still circulating oxygen through the empty shafts, in the hope that they might one day be reopened. Yet the people of Mingo County have forged their own brand of resilience, one born of the tight-knit rural values that draw embattled citizens together. For some, that means planning for a better future: Dr. Dino Beckett, a local physician, has spearheaded initiatives to grow healthy food locally and reduce diabetes. For others, it means lifting a defiant finger to the outside world. At the  Regional Church  in Delbarton, 10 miles from Williamson, Sunday services were both exuberant and solemn, a mark of the conservative Christianity that holds strong here. Peals of catchy gospel songs were followed by a fervent sermon delivered by an evangelical missionary who had taken 900 Jewish immigrants to Israel (in fulfillment of a biblical prophesy, she explained) and sought to convert Arab Muslims. Among the singers on stage was Bo Copley, the area\u2019s most famous out-of-work miner. His celebrity stems from  a visit Mrs. Clinton made to Williamson in May , when hundreds of jeering protesters, many wielding Trump signs, lined the main street. \u201cGo home!\u201d they yelled as Mrs. Clinton, wearing a strained smile, slipped into a private meeting. Mrs. Clinton has apologized for her comment about putting coal out of business, saying she was misunderstood. But Mr. Copley, who had been called to meet Mrs. Clinton, challenged her, sliding a photo of his three young children across the table while the television cameras rolled. \u201cHow can you come in here and tell us you\u2019re going to be our friend?\u201d he said, his voice cracking with emotion. \u201cBecause those people out there don\u2019t see you as a friend.\u201d Days later, at a Trump rally in the state capital, Charleston, Mr. Copley received a standing ovation. \u201cPeople are tired of politicians,\u201d he told me during my visit. \u201cTrump is a break from the status quo, which promises the moon but doesn\u2019t deliver.\u201d He struck a chord across coal country, giving voice to the inchoate rage and impotence that has accompanied the near-collapse, in less than a decade, of a lucrative industry. With salaries starting at $70,000 a year, a job in the mines was long considered the local jackpot. Mingo County\u2019s breathtaking valleys and hollers \u2014 narrow creeks bordered by high hills \u2014 are lined with spacious homes, swimming pools and gleaming vehicles. Now, there is a palpable fear that the good life is gone, perhaps for good. Jeremy Queen, 35, earned $30 an hour in a mine a few years ago. Now he is working security at a Walmart for $10.50 an hour, and the economic slump means even the shopping mall that houses his store is suffering. \u201cWhen the mines go down, it hurts everything,\u201d he said. Political fury in Mingo County focuses squarely on the Environmental Protection Agency and President Obama, who is seen as having started a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Issues of race and class bubble under the surface: Mingo County, population 27,000, is 97 percent white, and racial epithets that are taboo in much of America still ring out openly. Support for Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigrants is strong, even though Muslims constitute only a tiny fraction of West Virginians. In 2012, local Democrats  selected Keith Judd , a felon incarcerated in Texas, as their nominee for president instead of Mr. Obama. On a sleepy Sunday afternoon, a red pickup truck rolled slowly along Williamson\u2019s main street, bearing two giant flags: one for Mr. Trump, the other emblazoned with the Confederate colors. Corey Matney, 26 years old and wearing a National Rifle Association T-shirt, stepped out and asked why I was taking pictures. Of the Confederate flag, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s heritage, not hate.\u201d Mr. Matney, who was in Williamson to play Pok\u00e9mon Go with his girlfriend, is a linesman for a telecommunications company that, he said, is losing 500 customers a month. \u201cFamilies are moving away,\u201d he said. \u201cI know Donald Trump may not be the best man for the job. But he\u2019s the lesser of two evils.\u201d There is no doubt that Mr. Trump, a brash Manhattan tycoon who lives in a gilded tower, can seem a discordant political idol for rural America. Many overlook that, pointing to his business success and his war on \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d while berating Muslims and \u201ctree-hugger\u201d environmentalists. But some have been jarred by his ideas. Mr. Copley\u2019s wife, Lauren, has a sister whose husband is Jordanian, and was upset by a recent question from her 6-year-old niece. \u201cShe said, \u2018If Donald Trump comes in, does that mean that we have to leave?\u2019\u201d Ms. Copley recalled. Ms. Copley started to cry. \u201cHe just spouts off,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t fathom that.\u201d \u201cSome of the things he says really bother me,\u201d her husband added. \u201cBut we have a lot of people in this area who are very angry, very upset.\u201d Mr. Trump and his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, have yet to explain how they will revive the coal industry. Aside from the Obama administration\u2019s tough environmental regulations, the decline of coal is a product of hard economic realities: Natural gas, produced by new fracking technologies, is simply much cheaper. For West Virginians like Roger Ooten, 56, their ballots may be a mark of resignation more than one of hope. A giant Trump sign adorned the gate of Mr. Ooten\u2019s neat house in Delbarton, where he sat on the porch, rocking gently on a chair. He retired after 16 years working at a mine in Turkey Creek. Now he watches in despair as the community around him crumbles. Mr. Ooten is following the election on conservative channels like Fox News. He doesn\u2019t like Mr. Trump\u2019s invective against Mexicans. \u201cThey gotta eat, too,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be mean to people.\u201d But in November, Mr. Ooten will stick with Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s the only shot we got,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if something doesn\u2019t happen, this is going to be a ghost town.\u201d","articles_date":"19 8 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/08\/20\/world\/americas\/alienated-and-angry-coal-miners-see-donald-trump-as-their-only-choice.html","articles_title":"Alienated and Angry, Coal Miners See Donald Trump as Their Only Choice","candidate_fk":2,"first_name":"Bo","id":19,"issue":6,"last_name":"Copley","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) A train carrying members of Congress -- including House Speaker Paul Ryan -- to their legislative retreat in West Virginia hit a truck Wednesday, multiple sources told CNN.

But Guido R. Newbrough was born German, and he died in November as an  immigration  detainee of a Virginia jail, his heart devastated by an overwhelming bacterial infection. His family and fellow detainees say the infection went untreated, despite his mounting pleas for medical care in the 10 days before his death. Instead, after his calls for help grew insistent, detainees said, guards at the Piedmont Regional Jail in Farmville, Va., threw him to the floor, dragged him away as he cried out in pain, and locked him in an isolation cell. Mr. Newbrough, a construction worker who had served jail time for molesting a girlfriend\u2019s young daughter, was found unresponsive in the cell several days later, on Nov. 27, and died at a hospital the next day without regaining consciousness. An autopsy report last week cited a virulent staph infection as an underlying cause of his death from endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves that is typically cured with antibiotics. Accounts of Mr. Newbrough\u2019s last days echo other cases of deaths in immigration custody, including one at the same jail in December 2006, which prompted a review by immigration officials that found the medical unit so lacking that they concluded, \u201cDetainee health care is in jeopardy.\u201d But  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  never released those findings, even when asked about allegations of neglect in that death, of Abdoulai Sall, 50, a Guinea-born mechanic with no criminal record whose kidneys failed over several weeks. Instead, officials defended care in that case and other deaths as Congress and the news media questioned medical practices in the patchwork of county jails, private prisons and federal detention centers under contract to hold noncitizens while the government tries to deport them. The 2006 report \u2014 and a set of talking points the agency produced for its press officers to use when discussing deaths in detention \u2014 were only recently obtained by the  American Civil Liberties Union  through a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act; the group provided copies to The New York Times, which  first reported  Mr. Sall\u2019s death. \u201cThis facility has failed on multiple levels to perform basic supervision and provide for the safety and welfare of ICE detainees,\u201d the six-page report concluded shortly after he died. \u201cThe medical health care unit does not meet minimum ICE standards.\u201d The report said the jail had failed to respond adequately as Mr. Sall grew sicker, and that even when he was found unconscious on the floor, employees \u201cstood around for approximately one minute\u201d before trying to revive him. The jail\u2019s superintendent, who said he never saw the report, adamantly denied those conclusions this week. But Tom Jawetz, a lawyer with the civil liberties union\u2019s National Prison Project, said the new death at the same jail underscored the lack of accountability in immigration  detention  nationwide. \u201cPiedmont is a facility that was understaffed and underresponsive to clear medical needs,\u201d Mr. Jawetz said. \u201cThe reports of Mr. Newbrough\u2019s death raise serious questions about whether those failures were ever remedied.\u201d Asked Monday what measures it had taken after Mr. Sall\u2019s death, the immigration agency promised a response but did not provide one. Kelly A. Nantel, a spokeswoman, said earlier that an investigation of Mr. Newbrough\u2019s death was under way. The 780-bed Piedmont jail, run by governments of six Virginia counties, typically houses about 300 immigration detainees, and is now down to fewer than 150. But Ms. Nantel denied rumors that the agency was pulling them out, as it did last month at a detention center in Central Falls, R.I., where a Chinese computer engineer\u2019s extensive cancer and fractured spine went undiagnosed until shortly before his death on Aug. 6. In that case, investigators for the federal immigration agency found that the engineer, Hiu Lui Ng, had been denied proper medical treatment, and dragged from his cell to a van as he screamed in pain six days before his death. The parallels with detainee accounts of Mr. Newbrough\u2019s treatment are striking to Jeff Winder, an organizer for the grass-roots Virginia group  People United , who was contacted by several inmates at Piedmont who also spoke to a reporter. The latest death has heightened the group\u2019s opposition to plans by private developers and city officials to build another immigration detention center in Farmville, with 1,000 to 2,500 beds. \u201cICE has no obligation to send detainees there after the next detainee dies,\u201d Mr. Winder said. \u201cFarmville could be left with the reputation as a place where detainees die of medical neglect.\u201d Ernest L. Toney, the jail superintendent, denied accounts that Mr. Newbrough had been mistreated, saying, \u201cThat is not our protocol here.\u201d He referred all other questions about his death to the federal immigration agency. But Dr. Homer D. Venters, an expert in detention health care who learned about the case from Mr. Newbrough\u2019s family and reviewed the autopsy, said available evidence showed violations of detention standards that let the detainee\u2019s treatable local infections rage out of control. Dr. Venters, a public health fellow at New York University, was critical of the medical care in immigration detention when  he testified last year at a Congressional subcommittee hearing , and is on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement advisory group. \u201cFirst, Mr. Newbrough\u2019s medical complaints were apparently ignored,\u201d he wrote in a  preliminary analysis  of the case for Mr. Newbrough\u2019s parents. \u201cSecond, Mr. Newbrough was placed in a disciplinary setting while ill and despite having voiced medical complaints. Third, Mr. Newbrough was not adequately (if at all) medically monitored\u201d in the isolation cell. During those last days, Dr. Venters added in an interview, even guards should have noticed that Mr. Newbrough was in critical condition as the bacteria colonizing his heart broke loose, creating abscesses in his brain, liver and kidneys. \u201cWhen endocarditis is not treated, it kills people,\u201d he said. With modern hospital care, the death rate is 25 percent or less. \u201cWe were sitting here, powerless,\u201d said Mr. Newbrough\u2019s stepfather, Jack Newbrough, 70, a former Air Force sergeant who met Guido\u2019s mother, Heidi, and Guido, then 2, when he was stationed in their native Germany. \u201cI am just so disappointed in my country, this homeland security system they got set up.\u201d Mrs. Newbrough, 65, said her son, who had an estranged wife and three American-born children, had quit drinking after serving 11 months for molestation  and, on probation, moved back to his childhood home in Manassas, Va., from a trailer park in Stafford. A  1999 article about life in the park , in the first issue of Tina Brown\u2019s Talk magazine, featured him prominently \u2014 under the rubric \u201cDialing America.\u201d \u201cNobody knew he wasn\u2019t American,\u201d his mother said. \u201cEven he didn\u2019t know. He found out the day they picked him up here.\u201d His arrest last February, immigration records show, was a result of Operation Coldplay, which combs probation records to find past sex offenders whose immigration status makes them deportable. Mr. Newbrough had taken what is known as an Alford plea to charges of \u201cindecent liberties with a minor,\u201d and aggravated sexual battery in 2002 \u2014 denying his guilt, but acknowledging that prosecutors had evidence that could cause a jury to convict him of molesting his girlfriend\u2019s 4-year-old. Mr. Newbrough, who spoke no German, would have automatically become a citizen if his American-born stepfather had formally adopted him when he was a child, or if his mother had been naturalized while he was a minor, rather than just four years ago. While Mr. Newbrough waited at Piedmont for nine months, an immigration lawyer argued that he had derived citizenship from his stepfather. An immigration judge disagreed. The appeal was pending in mid-November when Mr. Newbrough began to complain in phone calls of terrible back pain and stomach aches, his family said. When they urged him to tell the medical staff, they said, he replied: \u201c\u00a0\u2018I did. They just don\u2019t care.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Several detainees interviewed by telephone last week said that in the two weeks before  Thanksgiving , Mr. Newbrough\u2019s back pain grew so bad that he began sobbing through the night, and some in the 90-man unit took turns making him hot compresses. By the Sunday before Thanksgiving, he was desperate, two detainees said, and banged at the door of the unit\u2019s lunchroom, yelling for help. They said by the time guards responded, he was seated at a table. \u201cThey told him to get up, and he said he couldn\u2019t get up because he was in a lot of pain,\u201d said Salvador Alberto Rivas, who identified himself as Mr. Newbrough\u2019s bunk mate, awaiting deportation to El Salvador. \u201cBecause of the pain, he started crying, and he was trying to tell them he had put in requests for medical and didn\u2019t get any. And then one of the guards threw him to the floor.\u201d \u201cThey drag him by his leg, in front of about 30 people,\u201d said another detainee, who gave his name only as Jose for fear of retaliation, adding that many witnesses had since been transferred to other jails or deported. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that he was dying,\u201d added Jose, who wrote about the case in a  letter published online  by a Spanish weekly. \u201cThey took him to the hole. He was yelling for help in the hole, too.\u201d That information, he said, came from a detainee in the isolation section at the same time, but since deported, who was so upset by Mr. Newbrough\u2019s death that he left his name and alien registration number \u2014 Rene Cordoba Palma, No. 088424581 \u2014 in case anyone wanted his testimony.","articles_date":"27 1 2009","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/01\/28\/us\/28detain.html","articles_title":"Another Jail Death, and Mounting Questions","candidate_fk":6,"first_name":"Jack","id":21,"issue":5,"last_name":"Newbrough","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) A faction of Republicans is pinning a last-ditch effort to stop Donald Trump on a long-shot rules change at the national convention. Sunday night, GOP operatives trying to drum up an anti-Trump coalition held their second conference call in five days. Roughly 1,000 interested people were on the call, according to organizer Steve Lonegan -- up sharply from the roughly three dozen who were on a similar call last week. The goal is passing a rule at the Republican National Convention in July that would free delegates to vote their \"conscience,\" negating any binding put in place by states' primaries.  The chorus calling for a miracle to save them from Trump's nomination represents a real angst in the Republican Party about the presumptive nominee, who has suffered weeks of bad headlines and poll data since the end of the GOP primary. While this appears to be the best-organized opposition effort so far to keeping Trump from winning the nomination in Cleveland, doing so is a nearly impossible task. GOP donors rattled by Trump Still, the Trump campaign went through a major shakeup Monday as  Trump ousted his controversial campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski.   It is unclear how many of the people on the phone call Sunday night were actual delegates. Lonegan, a former New Jersey gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidate, said his \"conservative\" estimate was about 250. The group has the backing of Courageous Conservatives PAC, a group which Lonegan serves as spokesman for and originally backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. The PAC will serve as a fundraising vehicle, Lonegan said. As of its last filing, the group had just over $4,000 cash on hand and had raised a total of about $360,000 in the primary. Next steps for the effort include a round of television and radio appearances, and encouraging supporters to make their own outreach through the press and social media. The biggest focus will be whipping votes on the convention Rules Committee. If the conscience clause proposed by Rules Committee delegate and group organizer Kendal Unruh, of Colorado, can win the backing of 57 Rules Committee members (half plus one), it could go to the floor for a simple majority vote of delegates to govern the convention. Part of the hope is that by preparing now, delegates will have options if Trump's numbers continue to tank.  \"We're walking into a disaster with this guy,\" said Pat Brady, the former Illinois GOP chairman and a delegate from Illinois for John Kasich, who has begun reaching out to donors and influencers about stopping a Trump nomination and was on the Sunday night call. \"If there's a chance we can clean up the mess, I want to be part of it.\" But even gathering dozens of convention-goers won't be near enough to get Trump off the ticket. \"I've also heard about Area 51, I've heard about Elvis sightings, I've heard a lot of things,\" RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said of the Republicans who insist there is a path for derailing Trump's nomination. \"The extent of this effort is a bunch of random people tweeting about it, full stop.\" Donald Trump accuses Jeb Bush of trying to oust him at the convention Trump says any insurgents are wasting their time. \"There are a couple of guys who are trying to go to Cleveland -- they're trying to get delegates,\" Trump said at a rally in Las Vegas Saturday. \"I thought they already tried that?  I mean, I could give you names, but I won't because it's meaningless.  First of all, it's illegal. Second of all you can't do it.  Third of all, we, not me, we got 14 almost 14 million votes, 14 million votes in the primary system.  That's more votes than ever received in the primaries in the history of the Republican Party.\" Trump knocks GOP leaders Lonegan insists it's Trump who doesn't understand the primary. \"What planet is this guy from? Who thinks it's illegal not to nominate him -- who says it's a coronation?\" Lonegan said. \"Yes, it will cause a gigantic, horrifying explosion of chaos and blah blah blah,\" said Rick Wilson, a veteran Florida Republican consultant and \"Never Trump\" leader. \"But I think by the time we get to that point, you will see Hillary Clinton has a 15-point lead and Donald Trump will have said more crazy s---. By that point you will have delegates say 'Hey, this a convention, not a suicide pact.'\" Changing the convention rules will likely not only require substantial support on the Rules Committee, it will require a majority of convention delegates to approve -- many of whom were recruited by and support the Trump campaign. And even if delegates sign off on the \"conscience\" idea, they could still choose Trump on a first ballot.  Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up  Another effort being organized by Republican strategists including M. Dane Waters and Eric O'Keefe, \"Delegates Unbound,\" plans to spend $2.5 million to $3.5 million on dual goals of educating delegates about their belief that delegates should be free to vote their beliefs under the current rules, and on a separate goal of stopping Trump.   \"Is it a long shot? Of course it's a long shot,\" Waters said. \"It's going to be a difficult road, but I think we're getting to the point that people truly want to do something. Four weeks is an eternity in politics, so anything can happen in the next four weeks.\" Facing headwinds Brady downplayed the uphill climb, emphasizing that even with little money, all the movement needs is a few key supporters. \"They don't have to raise that much money,\" Brady said. \"This is just an internal RNC lobbying push. You've got 112 people, you've got a lobby,\" he added, referring to the total number of Rules Committee members.  The anti-Trump forces have yet to show strength outside of small factions, and face skepticism from people who would be key allies. Even delegates that are free to vote their conscience are not planning to switch off Trump.  CNN is in regular touch with more than 50 of the nearly 120 so-called unbound delegates headed to the national convention, and none are changing already stated plans to cast a nominating ballot for Trump. Kirk Williamson was selected as delegate in Louisiana for Marco Rubio, but by state rules became free to vote for anyone once the Florida senator dropped out of the race. Williamson has coordinated among the Rubio delegates in Louisiana to communicate with the press how they'll vote -- and all five put out a statement saying they'd support Trump once he became the presumptive nominee.  \"Nothing's changed, as a matter of fact, everything's kind of quiet and died down since a month ago,\" Williamson told CNN on Friday. \"My personal position and as far as I know, the position of the other Rubio delegates, has not changed. We will vote for the presumptive nominee.\" If there were some sort of delegate uprising, Ken Cuccinelli, the delegate chief for Cruz during the senator's presidential bid, would be a logical organizer to seek. Cuccinelli oversaw Cruz's powerful delegate wrangling operation and has been in touch with the hundreds of supporters he's still sending to the convention. But Cuccinelli maintains that the active role he is keeping in delegate matters is focused on influencing the platform and rules developed at the convention -- not scuttling Trump. \"Beyond that, and to the extent that he has influence, he has not been (no does he plan to become) involved in any effort to circumvent Trump and his presumptive nominee role,\" Cuccinelli spokeswoman Mallory Rascher said in an email. Convention Rules Committee delegate and RNC Standing Rules Committee member Solomon Yue, of Oregon is adamant there will be no successful revolt.  He pointed out that roughly four out of five delegates are either Cruz or Trump supporters, who tend to favor anti-Washington sympathies. \"The common denominator of the delegates is anti-establishment, anti-Washington,\" Yue said. \"Never Trump people, they are representing Washington and the establishment. ... I just don't see how this could happen.\" Spicer said that if 2012 rules currently governing are re-established by the Rules Committee, the secretary of the convention will record any vote of a bound delegate, including an abstention, as it should be cast by state rules.  CNN delegate analyst and former Rubio campaign aide Will Holley notes the rule governing the convention as of now says the \"secretary of the convention shall faithfully announce and record each delegate's vote in accordance with the delegate's obligation under these rules, state law or state party rule\" -- and he doesn't buy the argument that abstaining gets around that.   \"Some might argue that 'abstention' isn't support for another candidate so it's not in violation, but you'd need to squint pretty hard to see that in the rules, in my opinion,\" Holley said.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, who will preside over the convention in Cleveland, pledged neutrality in an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday.  \"It is not my job to tell delegates to do, what not to do, or to weigh in on things like that. They write the rules. They make their decisions,\" Ryan said. Bill Kristol , the Weekly Standard editor looking to find a Trump alternative, took inspiration from the Cleveland Cavaliers' NBA championship win Sunday night. \"Cleveland Cavaliers: First team to rally from 3-1 to win NBA final. Cleveland Convention: First to free its delegates to win the presidency,\" Kristol tweeted.  Any plan would almost certainly require backing from a majority of the 2,472 convention delegates total on the public floor of the convention. And a common scenario is delegates deciding to give up their tickets to Cleveland, meaning they would likely be replaced with people favoring Trump regardless, meaning a vote to change the rules would be more difficult. In Ohio, for example, where all of the delegates are bound to support John Kasich -- two have notified the party that they do not intend to go to the convention now that Trump is the nominee, with one calling herself a conscientious objector and another, Ross McGregor (R-Springfield), citing a traveling conflict.  \"I probably had 70 people call and offer to take their places,\" said Matt Borges, Chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. \"And we're all voting for John Kasich anyway; we're bound to John Kasich, so we're going to vote for Kasich on the first ballot \u2014 and I don't think there's going to be any second ballot, so none of these people will ever actually cast a vote for Donald Trump.\" \"We're going to have a great time,\" Borges said, noting that the delegation plans to honor Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, former House Speaker John Boehner and former Gov. John Kasich and boost enthusiasm for down ballot candidates. \"We've got a very, very packed busy schedule of events for our delegation, plus we want to help make sure Cleveland looks good.\" Borges added that he feels that he \"said my peace during the primaries.\" He subsequently spoke with Trump for 40 minutes: \"We're just moving forward now,\" he said, stating that he did not feel comfortable revealing what they discussed in a private conversation.   \"I'm going to help Trump build an organization in Ohio, because in some ways we are bound to each other,\" Borges added. \"They cannot win without us; and we really would be remiss if we didn't have a strong top of the ticket organization to help us along there.\"  CNN's Marshall Cohen and Theodore Schleifer contributed to this report.","articles_date":"20 6 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/06\/19\/politics\/rnc-delegate-angst-donald-trump\/index.html","articles_title":"Anti-Trump delegate faction says it's raising cash, faces long odds","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":22,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Congress is considering placing new limits on the Trump administration's war-making powers as the White House delegates key decisions on military action to the Pentagon. Democrats and some key Republicans say they're alarmed that President Donald Trump has delegated the decision to set troop levels in Afghanistan to his defense secretary, James Mattis, particularly when the administration has yet to outline its larger strategy for the longest war in US history. And the US military's  shooting down of a Syrian government jet on Sunday  has injected new urgency for advocates in Congress who want to pass an authorization for use of military force against ISIS -- which could at the same time limit military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Lawmakers say that the escalating military action in Syria -- including the jet shootdown, commanders' increased authority to take military action and Trump's decision in April to launch missile strikes against government targets -- underscores the need for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority to authorize war. \"With this President quietly delegating authorities to the secretary of defense and commanders of the field, I think it's critical that this committee and the Congress as a whole embrace our oversight duties,\" said Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who was Foreign Relations chairman when the committee voted on an ISIS war authorization in 2014. \"We've had nine Americans killed in combat missions this year. Campaigns have ramped up, I read about a surge in Afghanistan. And I continually don't have a sense of what the totality of the strategy is,\" Menendez added. Still, Congress faces major hurdles to passing legislation that could authorize the use of force against ISIS or the Assad regime, as the balance of war-making power has markedly shifted toward the Executive Branch under both the Obama and Trump administrations. In addition to deep divisions about whether Congress should limit the commander in chief over where and when he can deploy troops in the war on terror, many in Congress are wary about taking a politically difficult vote on the ISIS war. A 16-year-old war authorization The Obama and Trump administrations have relied on the war authorization that passed right after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as legal justification for military action against ISIS. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford said that authority also provided the justification for the US to shoot down a Syrian jet that was threatening US-backed forces. The recent military action against the Assad regime -- the US military also shot down a pro-regime drone on Monday -- has amplified concerns that the war authorization is being stretched too far, and Congress needs to step in. \"You can't justify going after ISIS under the 2001 (Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF), let alone going after Syrian aircraft,\" said Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"That is absolutely absurd.\" The foreign relations committee held a hearing on a war authorization Tuesday that's authored by Sens. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, and Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican. Their bill would sunset the 2001 war authorization and provide new authority to go after ISIS, al-Qaeda and other associated terrorist groups but it would not include authority for attacking the Assad regime. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the committee's chairman, expressed a desire to pass a new war authorization but he also expressed some skepticism that Congress would be able to do so. \"Some members of Congress will use this debate for the singular purpose of imposing limitations on our president. It's just a fact,\" Corker said. \"Others may refuse to limit a president at war in any way. That's a fact. And that's a wide gap to bridge.\" Afghanistan troop decisions The White House last week  gave the authority  to set troop levels in Afghanistan to Mattis amid an internal disagreement among administration factions over the best path forward there. The Pentagon is considering an increase of 3,000-to-5,000 troops in Afghanistan to help bolster the Afghan forces in their fight against the Taliban. Trump himself has said very little about the 16-year-old war since becoming president, as well as during the 2016 presidential campaign. And the move has sparked criticism from Democrats that Trump is disinterested in fulfilling his duties as commander in chief, as well as concerns about the over-militarization of his administration. While Mattis is the civilian leader of the Pentagon, he's also former Marine general, and Trump's national security adviser H.R. McMaster is an active-duty three-star Army general. \"I think it's an abdication of a core executive responsibility, setting troop levels,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. \"Viewing Afghanistan only through a military lens will continue us down a rabbit hole of failure. The fact the President is supposed to be looking at every component of the Afghanistan strategy, and he's basically outsourced the Afghanistan issue to the military, which clouds the fact that Afghanistan is more so a governance problem than it is a military problem.\" To many Republicans, however, Trump's decision is a sign he's listening to commanders in the field, and is a response to criticism of the Obama White House that it was micro-managing military action and setting artificial withdrawal dates for Iraq and Afghanistan. \"That's essentially what he said he's going to be doing \u2014 he's going to rely on the uniforms as opposed to what we've been looking at the last eight years,\" said Oklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe. But the Trump administration still has not laid out its strategy for Afghanistan either, which has drawn the ire of a key Senate Republican, John McCain. McCain ripped into the White House and the Pentagon on Tuesday, issuing a warning that he was prepared to give the Trump administration an Afghan strategy if it would not set one for itself. \"The President has two choices: either give us a strategy or we will put a strategy that we develop into the defense authorization bill,\" McCain said. \"We're talking about shooting down airplanes in Syria. We're talking about Afghanistan, that there's going to be X-thousand troop increase. And yet no one has informed the American people and this committee. So I have to say that I want some answers.\"","articles_date":"21 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/21\/politics\/congress-trump-war-limits\/index.html","articles_title":"As White House defers to Pentagon, Congress mulls new checks on military power","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":23,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) The annual Conservative Political Action Conference is meeting this week in Maryland, and in some ways, it's a good time to be a conservative. Republicans control all branches of the federal government, while Democrats and liberals are shut out. In other important ways, though, there are signs that conservatism may be peaking, while liberalism is on the rise.  In the early 1970s, the Republican Party was not a conservative one. According to the  General Social Survey , only 43% of self-identified Republicans called themselves conservative in 1974. Two years later, Gerald Ford, who 40% of Americans called conservative and 10% of Americans called a liberal in a pre-election CBS News\/New York Times poll, beat out the more conservative Ronald Reagan for the Republican presidential nomination.  But when Reagan won the nomination in 1980, the conservative movement was off and running. By the mid-1980s, regularly more than 50% of Republicans called themselves conservatives in  General Social Survey  data. By the mid-2000s, it was up to 60%.  Pence addresses gun debate by touting school safety at CPAC Republican presidential candidates generally reflected this rise in conservatism. Every Republican nominee from 1980 to 2012 had a wider spread than Ford did in pre-election polling between the percentages of Americans who called the nominee conservative and liberal. This peaked with George W. Bush in 2004, who 68% of Republicans called conservative in a pre-election  Gallup survey .  This past decade, however, conservatism hasn't been rising. The 64% of Republicans who identified as conservative in the 2016 General Social Survey are not statistically significant different from the 65% who said they were in 2008. In fact, every General Social Survey poll since 2008 has found that conservatives make up about that share of Republicans.  The peaking of conservatism is seen in  Gallup's polling  as well. Over the course of 2017, 69% of Republicans called themselves conservative. That's up from the 62% of Republicans who said they were conservative in 2001. It's not statistically different from the 70% of Republicans who identified as conservatives at the end of the last decade, however.  While conservatism growth may have stunted in the Republican electorate, the nominee they chose to lead their party in 2016 was arguably the least conservative in the last 40 years. In Gallup's pre-election poll on the subject, 47% of Americans said Republican Donald Trump was conservative, and 19% called him liberal. The difference between the percentage of Americans who called Trump conservative and liberal -- 28 percentage points -- was the lowest I could find in CBS News\/New York Times or Gallup polling for any Republican nominee since at least 1976, when polling on the subject first began.  Trump's nomination came when there were plenty of conservative options. Republican voters passed on Sen. Ted Cruz when the Texan was one of the last candidates standing between Trump and the nomination. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was forced out of the race a  few months after entering it .  While conservatism may have peaked among Republican, liberalism is clearly on the rise among Democrats. More Democrats (48%) self-identified as liberal in the 2016 General Social Survey than in any other General Social Survey taken since 1974. In Gallup's 2017 data, a record 50% of Democrats said they were liberal. That was a 20 percentage point rise from 2001, when only 30% of Democrats said they were liberal.  The rise of liberalism among Democrats has all but wiped out conservative Democrats. Back in 2001, they made up 25% of Democrats in Gallup polling. That's dropped by nearly half, to only 13% in 2017.  The combination of all these forces led to an all-time high -- since Gallup first tracked it in 1992 -- of 26% of all Americans identifying as liberal in Gallup's polling. An all-time low of 35% of Americans called themselves conservative.  The change in the Democratic electorate has been reflected well in its nominees for president. As an example, look at the difference between Bill and Hillary Clinton. When Bill Clinton first ran for president in 1992, 38% of Americans said he was liberal in a CBS News\/New York Times poll and 42% of them said he was liberal in a Gallup survey. In 2016, 58% of Americans said Hillary Clinton was liberal in a Gallup survey.  When you combine CBS News\/New York Times data, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were the most liberal Democratic nominees for president since at least 1976. And although Trump was seen as the most liberal Republican nominee in at least 40 years, the record for a Democratic nominee being called conservative is still held by Jimmy Carter from 1980 (i.e. the first Democrat in our data set).  Indeed, the Democratic field for president in 2016 was probably the most liberal on record in the last 40 years. Clinton was battling it out with a  self-described socialist , independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who got  43% of the primary vote . Back when Bill Clinton was running in 1992, his two chief rivals were Paul Tsongas, who wanted to  tackle the budget deficit , and Jerry Brown, who  proposed a flat tax . The only somewhat conservative candidate in the Democratic field of 2016, Jim Webb, a former US senator from Virginia, dropped out of the race early on and  said he wouldn't vote for Clinton .  As we head into the 2020 campaign, the potential Democratic nominees seem to be falling over each other in trying to move to the left. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California have voted with the President's agenda  15% of the time or less . Gillibrand, who once was a  moderate member of Congress  from upstate New York, has voted with him a record low 8% of the time.  We'll see if the Democratic electorate responds to this liberalism. As Trump showed, sometimes an ideologically polarized electorate makes a surprising choice.

Many moderate Democrats -- including several up for re-election in red states -- support the proposed changes to Dodd-Frank, a law enacted in 2010, arguing the tough rules ended up hurting smaller banks. But many progressive Democrats strongly oppose easing regulations for the banks, warning doing so could lead to another financial crisis like the one in 2008, which triggered a deep recession. The Senate approved a procedural motion on a 67-to-32 vote and will move soon to formal debate on the bill, which could start immediately, if there is cooperation and agreement. If not, formal debate could be held up for up to 30 hours. Seventeen senators who caucus with the Democrats joined with all Republicans who were present, an indication that measure can pass the chamber when a final vote takes place, possibly next week.   \"The Senate -- with the support of some Democrats -- is set to start debate on a bill to roll back regulations on the same big banks we bailed out a few years ago. If we lose the final vote next week, we'll be paving the way for the next big crash,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and a leading liberal who is a vocal critic of changing the law. Ahead of Tuesday's vote, Warren told reporters she planned to introduce a dozen amendments to the bill to shore up protections for consumers. It's unclear if she will be able to get votes on her proposals.  \"I'm going to fight back,\" Warren said. \"The American people have not forgotten. Millions of people lost their jobs. Millions of people lost their savings.\"  Progressive Democrats also seized on a report by the Congressional Budget Office released Monday evening that showed the bill would increase the federal deficit by $671 million and increase the likelihood a Wall Street mega-bank will fail.  \"The independent budget scorekeeper confirmed what we know -- this bank giveaway bill will cost taxpayers,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"Hard working Americans shouldn't have to pay for favors to Wall Street, foreign mega-banks and their lobbyists.\" Warren and Brown both expressed frustration with those moderate Democrats for providing Republicans with the necessary votes to pass the bill. But unlike Warren, many of the measure's Democratic co-sponsors hail from rural states won by President Donald Trump. They argue they must respond to the distinct political and banking needs in their states, which they say have been hurt by consolidation in the banking industry since Dodd-Frank was enacted. Their support for the long-sought reform may also demonstrate to their voters, many who voted for Trump, that they can work with the president and not reflexively oppose anything he supports.  \"When we passed Dodd-Frank, it was to stop the biggest guys from tanking the economy again,\" said Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who supports the bill.  \"We've seen the regulation bleed down. In Montana, we went from 72 community banks to 47.\" Other centrist Democratic backers include Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri.    \"After years of bipartisan work to advance regulatory relief for the community banks and credit unions across Indiana, I'm pleased that the full Senate will debate the legislative package I negotiated,\" Donnelly said in a statement. \"This legislation would make it easier for Hoosier families to gain access to mortgages and small businesses to access capital, and it also includes important new consumer protections, such as free credit freezes, in response to the Equifax data breach.\" Backers of the plan argue that smaller banks shouldn't have to face the same set of strict rules as behemoth Wall Street banks that could endanger the entire financial system if they go under.  In a pen-and-pad with reporters on Tuesday, four moderate Democrats -- Heitkamp, Tester, Donnelly and Warner -- tried to dispel mischaracterizations of the bill. \"I am not going to let this legislative history be papered with misconceptions of this bill,\" Heitkamp said. Other co-sponsors come from purple states, like Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia, Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Gary Peters of Michigan. The new Democratic senator from Alabama, Doug Jones, is also a supporter. \"I'm very worried about the consolidation of the banking industry in Virginia,\" said Kaine, who was Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016 and who describes himself as a \"huge\" supporter of Dodd-Frank.  \"But I believe a consequence of it has been to accelerate consolidation of banks.\" Brown dismissed questions about the political divisions in his party and blasted his colleagues for supporting a bill that he said would make the banking system less safe. \"I don't have an opinion on how it should play in the midterms,\" Brown said. \"I wonder how it's going to play out in the next 10 years if we start rolling back Wall Street rules. I'm between concerned and alarmed about what my colleagues are doing on weakening bank rules.\" Warner acknowledged the division in the Democratic caucus but expressed optimism the party could work through changes to improve the bill. \"We feel very good about getting through this process,\" Warner told reporters. The biggest change in the bill would raise the trigger at which banks are considered \"too big to fail\" from $50 billion in assets to $250 billion in assets. That means more than two dozen banks would be shielded from some of the Federal Reserve's oversight. It would also exempt American operations of big foreign banks, like Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and Banco Santander. Proponents of the Dodd-Frank law have sharply criticized the bill, arguing it would weaken protections aimed at keeping the financial system safe from another crisis. \"The provisions of the bill, particularly when coupled with the clearly expressed deregulatory agenda of the Trump administration and its key financial regulators, will once again put us on the path of exposing American taxpayers, our financial system, and our economy to significant risk,\" Phil Angelides, a former chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, said in a statement.","articles_date":"6 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/06\/politics\/banking-bill-advances-in-senate\/index.html","articles_title":"Banking bill advances in US Senate, highlights Democratic divide","candidate_fk":4,"first_name":"Joe","id":26,"issue":6,"last_name":"Manchin","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Major banking reform legislation that sharply divides Democrats advanced Tuesday in the Senate.

It's unclear if she will be able to get votes on her proposals.  \"I'm going to fight back,\" Warren said. \"The American people have not forgotten. Millions of people lost their jobs. Millions of people lost their savings.\"  Progressive Democrats also seized on a report by the Congressional Budget Office released Monday evening that showed the bill would increase the federal deficit by $671 million and increase the likelihood a Wall Street mega-bank will fail.  \"The independent budget scorekeeper confirmed what we know -- this bank giveaway bill will cost taxpayers,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"Hard working Americans shouldn't have to pay for favors to Wall Street, foreign mega-banks and their lobbyists.\" Warren and Brown both expressed frustration with those moderate Democrats for providing Republicans with the necessary votes to pass the bill. But unlike Warren, many of the measure's Democratic co-sponsors hail from rural states won by President Donald Trump. They argue they must respond to the distinct political and banking needs in their states, which they say have been hurt by consolidation in the banking industry since Dodd-Frank was enacted. Their support for the long-sought reform may also demonstrate to their voters, many who voted for Trump, that they can work with the president and not reflexively oppose anything he supports.  \"When we passed Dodd-Frank, it was to stop the biggest guys from tanking the economy again,\" said Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who supports the bill.  \"We've seen the regulation bleed down. In Montana, we went from 72 community banks to 47.\" Other centrist Democratic backers include Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri.    \"After years of bipartisan work to advance regulatory relief for the community banks and credit unions across Indiana, I'm pleased that the full Senate will debate the legislative package I negotiated,\" Donnelly said in a statement. \"This legislation would make it easier for Hoosier families to gain access to mortgages and small businesses to access capital, and it also includes important new consumer protections, such as free credit freezes, in response to the Equifax data breach.\" Backers of the plan argue that smaller banks shouldn't have to face the same set of strict rules as behemoth Wall Street banks that could endanger the entire financial system if they go under.  In a pen-and-pad with reporters on Tuesday, four moderate Democrats -- Heitkamp, Tester, Donnelly and Warner -- tried to dispel mischaracterizations of the bill. \"I am not going to let this legislative history be papered with misconceptions of this bill,\" Heitkamp said. Other co-sponsors come from purple states, like Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia, Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Gary Peters of Michigan. The new Democratic senator from Alabama, Doug Jones, is also a supporter. \"I'm very worried about the consolidation of the banking industry in Virginia,\" said Kaine, who was Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016 and who describes himself as a \"huge\" supporter of Dodd-Frank.  \"But I believe a consequence of it has been to accelerate consolidation of banks.\" Brown dismissed questions about the political divisions in his party and blasted his colleagues for supporting a bill that he said would make the banking system less safe. \"I don't have an opinion on how it should play in the midterms,\" Brown said. \"I wonder how it's going to play out in the next 10 years if we start rolling back Wall Street rules. I'm between concerned and alarmed about what my colleagues are doing on weakening bank rules.\" Warner acknowledged the division in the Democratic caucus but expressed optimism the party could work through changes to improve the bill. \"We feel very good about getting through this process,\" Warner told reporters. The biggest change in the bill would raise the trigger at which banks are considered \"too big to fail\" from $50 billion in assets to $250 billion in assets. That means more than two dozen banks would be shielded from some of the Federal Reserve's oversight. It would also exempt American operations of big foreign banks, like Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and Banco Santander. Proponents of the Dodd-Frank law have sharply criticized the bill, arguing it would weaken protections aimed at keeping the financial system safe from another crisis. \"The provisions of the bill, particularly when coupled with the clearly expressed deregulatory agenda of the Trump administration and its key financial regulators, will once again put us on the path of exposing American taxpayers, our financial system, and our economy to significant risk,\" Phil Angelides, a former chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, said in a statement.","articles_date":"6 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/06\/politics\/banking-bill-advances-in-senate\/index.html","articles_title":"Banking bill advances in US Senate, highlights Democratic divide","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":27,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 With West Virginia\u2019s economy battered by a coal industry  in free fall , Senator  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont is hoping that a strong showing in this state\u2019s Democratic primary on Tuesday will keep him a force in the party\u2019s politics by showing that his message still resonates, even though his rival,  Hillary Clinton , has an almost insurmountable lead in delegates. As Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have campaigned here in recent weeks, they have found frustrated voters who express the kinds of anxieties heard all across the country \u2014 only with a far greater degree of urgency and pain, as they see their communities wither before their eyes. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to be forgotten,\u201d said Betty Dolin, who co-owns a restaurant in Danville, about 20 miles southwest of Charleston, where customers tucked into hearty meals like meatloaf and country fried steak with gravy. She pointed out the empty tables that would once have been filled. \u201cWe can\u2019t have coal? Bring us something else,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean job training. A lot of these men are too old to train for another job.\u201d Presidential primaries tend to bring attention to local issues as candidates move from state to state, and as the candidates have come to West Virginia to campaign, coal has been no exception. \u201cThese communities need help,\u201d Mr. Sanders said last week at a food bank in McDowell County. \u201cIt is not the coal miners\u2019 fault in terms of what\u2019s happening in this world.\u201d In some ways, Mr. Sanders is not a natural candidate to be courting the votes of coal miners: He is outspoken on  climate change  and advocates moving away from fossil fuels. But his message of economic fairness has been embraced by white, working-class voters. Mr. Sanders has proposed legislation that would  provide $41 billion  to help coal and other fossil fuel workers and their communities, offering support like financial assistance and job training. Mrs. Clinton has her own  $30 billion plan  to help coal miners and their communities, including a program to help school districts that are losing revenue. But what people here bring up is a comment she made about coal workers in March, when she said during a televised forum, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d She was talking about providing opportunity through clean energy, and she emphasized that coal miners must not be left behind, but the sound bite was a damning one. When Mrs. Clinton  visited Mingo County  last week, she was met with chants of \u201cGo home!\u201d from protesters. At a round-table event, Bo Copley, a 39-year-old father who had lost his job in the coal industry, told her, \u201cI just want to know how you can say you\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners out of jobs and then come in here and tell us how you\u2019re going to be our friend.\u201d Mrs. Clinton called her comment a \u201cmisstatement\u201d and expressed regret. But it offended voters in struggling coal communities, and a candidate for West Virginia\u2019s Supreme Court even used it  in a campaign ad . \u201cA lot of people that I know are laid off, and you know that had to hurt the people,\u201d said Janet White, 80, a librarian whose husband was a coal miner. With Donald J. Trump having  vanquished  his two remaining primary opponents last week, the Republican contest here holds little significance, but when Mr. Trump campaigned in West Virginia, he found a receptive audience. At a rally in Charleston last week, he donned a hard hat given to him by an industry group that had endorsed him, the West Virginia Coal Association, and mimicked shoveling coal. \u201cMy hair look O.K.?\u201d he asked after taking the hat off. Mr. Trump gushed about mining, telling the crowd that he was fascinated by it and promising to revive the industry. \u201cYou watch what happens: If I win, we\u2019re going to bring those miners back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be so proud of your president.\u201d He did not explain how he would go about doing that. The signs of the state\u2019s economic distress are all over, particularly in areas known for coal production, like Boone County, south of Charleston. In the window of a barbershop and beauty salon in Madison is a yellow sign: \u201cWe support coal and those who mine it!\u201d But inside, Barbara Bias had no customers. The wives of coal miners used to come in with money to spend, she said. Not anymore. \u201cBoone County used to be booming, and now there\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a ghost town, because when the coal goes out, it hurts all of us.\u201d In the last quarter of 2011, West Virginia had about 24,700 coal mining jobs; by the last quarter of 2015, that number had fallen to about 14,500, a decline of more than 40 percent, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The industry has suffered because of a combination of factors, and a slew of coal companies have filed for bankruptcy protection. The rise of hydraulic fracturing has caused a boom in  natural gas  production, driving down prices and prompting electric utilities to switch from coal to natural gas. A decade ago, coal was the source of about half of the country\u2019s electricity generation; now, its share is  about one-third , according to the federal Energy Information Administration. Tougher environmental regulations have also taken a toll \u2014 the Obama administration  has pushed  to cut carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, and President Obama is deeply unpopular in West Virginia \u2014 as has a decline in demand for coal exports. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm of those three factors coming together at about the same time,\u201d said John Deskins, the director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at West Virginia University. So far in 2016, coal production in West Virginia is down by more than a third compared with 2015, according to federal data.","articles_date":"10 5 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/05\/11\/us\/politics\/west-virginia-primary-preview.html","articles_title":"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton Court West Virginians Hit Hard by Coal\u2019s Decline","candidate_fk":2,"first_name":"Bo","id":28,"issue":8,"last_name":"Copley","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Vice President Joe Biden will give his hopeful successor, Sen.

President Donald Trump, speaking in Bedminster, New Jersey, said he condemned \"in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.\"  \"It has been going on for a long time in our country -- not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America,\" he added. He did not mention white nationalists and the alt-right movement in his remarks. Trump also took to Twitter earlier Saturday afternoon to weigh in on the violent demonstration, which has caused Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe to issue  a state of emergency.  \"We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for,\" the President wrote. \"There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!\" Vice President Mike Pence echoed Trump's sentiment on Twitter, quoting the President's tweet and adding, \"I stand with @POTUS against hate & violence.\" \"U.S is greatest when we join together & oppose those seeking to divide us,\" he continued. The rally could be the \"largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the United States,\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Police began to break up crowds shortly before noon after city officials declared the gathering an \"unlawful assembly.\"  But tensions between those attending the rally and counter-protesters  continued throughout the day . At least one person was killed and 19 were injured a speeding car slammed into a throng of counterprotesters, according to  a statement  released on the City of Charlottesville's verified Twitter account. The driver was later taken into custody, the city said in a news release. It did not name the person. Trump's failure to explicitly mention that white nationalists were behind the protests and violence drew criticism from Republican leaders, including Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the most senior Republican in the Senate.  \"We should call evil by its name. My brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home,\" Hatch tweeted.  Hatch's office also responded to a march of torch-bearing white nationalists on Friday night, saying \"their tiki torches may be fueled by citronella but their ideas are fueled by hate, & have no place in civil society.\" Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner also criticized Trump for not being specific in his condemnation of Saturday's violence. \"Mr. President - we must call evil by its name,\"  Gardner tweeted.  \"These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.\" First lady Melania Trump joined her husband in condemning the violence, as did the President's homeland security and counterterrorism aide, Thomas Bossert.  \"Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate w\/o hate in our hearts,\" the first lady tweeted Saturday afternoon. \"No good comes from violence.\" \"The violence and hate in Charlotte (sic) are unacceptable. Protests must not undermine law and order, Bossert wrote on Twitter. He added that he has \"confidence in state\/local law enforcement.\" RELATED: Trump condemns 'hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides' in Charlottesville White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump chimed in on Sunday morning with a call for unity. \"There should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis,\" she tweeted. \"We must all come together as Americans -- and be one country UNITED.\" Other Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, all spoke out against the rally. Ryan wrote on Twitter Saturday that \"the views fueling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant.\"  \"Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry,\" he continued. He later added \"White supremacy is a scourge. This hate and its terrorism must be confronted and defeated.\" McCain issued a passionate statement Saturday evening in response to the rally and the car attack. \"Our Founders fought a revolution for the idea that all men are created equal,\" his statement read. \"The heirs of that revolution fought a Civil War to save our nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to that revolutionary proposition. Nothing less is at stake on the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, where a violent attack has taken at least one American life and injured many others in a confrontation between our better angels and our worst demons.\" \"White supremacists and neo-Nazis are, by definition, opposed to American patriotism and the ideals that define us as a people and make our nation special,\" McCain continued. \"As we mourn the tragedy that has occurred in Charlottesville, American patriots of all colors and creeds must come together to defy those who raise the flag of hatred and bigotry.\"  McConnell  tweeted , \"The hate and bigotry witnessed in #Charlottesville does not reflect American values. I wholeheartedly oppose their actions.\" And McDaniel said that hatred and bigotry was \"dangerous (and) cowardly.\" \"Free speech may give them the right to do this but also empowers us to unite to loudly speak out against it,\" she wrote in a follow-up tweet.  Across the aisle, former President Barack Obama quoted Nelson Mandela in reaction to the day's violence. \"'No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion. ... People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love. ... For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite,\" he wrote in a series of tweets.  Trump's 2016 rival Hillary Clinton also took to Twitter to condemn the protests. \"My heart is in Charlottesville today, and with everyone made to feel unsafe in their country,\" the former secretary of state wrote. In a series of subsequent tweets, Clinton implicitly called out the President for his failure to specifically condemn the white nationalists who organized the event. \"The incitement of hatred that got us here is as real and condemnable as the white supremacists in our streets,\" she wrote \"Every minute we allow this to persist through tacit encouragement or inaction is a disgrace, & corrosive to our values. Now is the time for leaders to be strong in their words & deliberate in their actions.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted directly at the President about his remarks, writing: \"Repeat after me, @realDonaldTrump: white supremacy is an affront to American values.\"  She also spoke out against the rally, tweeting, \"Our nation is defined by the march of progress. Our strength lies in our diversity. We must reject hate.\" Earlier, former President Bill Clinton tweeted, \"Even as we protect free speech and assembly, we must condemn hatred, violence and white supremacy.\" And former Vice President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter: \"No. Not in America. We must be stronger, more determined and more united than ever. Racism and hate have no place here.\" He also responded to Trump's \"many sides\" statement with a tweet reading \"There is only one side. #charlottesville.\" Former Vice President Al Gore, speaking at the progressive Netroots Nation gathering in Atlanta, said he \"was surprised\" by the President's statement.  \"The statement appeared to give a kind of moral equivalence to the people who had organized this KKK-Nazi march and the people who said, 'We're going to stand against fascism and Nazism and racism, and we don't want that in our community,'\" Gore said.  \"Mr. President, for the sake of our country, I would urge you to try again,\" Gore said. \"I say in all sincerity, Mr. President, I would urge you to give more thought to what it means to have a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi movement marching and creating this kind of hatefulness.\" Sen. Kamala Harris of California called the rally \"un-American\" in a tweet. \"We must all stand against hatred and bigotry, she wrote. \"Our unity is our strength and diversity is our power.\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote, \"The white nationalist demonstration in #Charlottesville is a reprehensible display of racism and hatred that has no place in our society.\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine called \"displays of violence and bigotry\" by white nationlists in Charlotte \"sickening.\" \"The fact that people like David Duke cited the President to justify their views is a disturbing reminder that divisive rhetoric has sadly contributed to a climate where individuals who espouse hate feel emboldened,\" Kaine wrote in a statement Saturday.   He also penned a extensive response on Facebook to Friday night's march. \"I'm deeply disturbed that our country has to wake up to headlines of torch-wielding white nationalists promoting bigotry and inciting fear on a college campus in Virginia,\" he wrote. \"Racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric sow seeds of hatred in our communities. That's not who we are, that's not what Virginians stand for, and we have no intention of moving backwards toward the division of the past. People peddling in hate from outside of Charlottesville will never define this vibrant community.\" Admiral John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations called the events in Charlottesville \"shameful\" and \"unacceptable.\"  \"The Navy will forever stand against intolerance and hatred\" Richardson said in a statement posted on Twitter and Facebook. \"We want our Navy to be the safest possible place -- a team as strong and tough as we can be, saving violence only for our enemies.\" CNN's Dan Merica, Sophie Tatum and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.

The Elvis relative has taken calls from top Democrats, like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the only Democrat in the state's congressional delegation, Rep. Bennie Thompson.  And they all have a message: This is the year a Democrat can win in Mississippi, especially if the GOP eats its own. \"Anybody that is a Democrat in the South can look to Alabama and finally see a light at the end of the tunnel,\" said Presley, who's been elected three times to the state utility regulatory commission, and whose grandfather was the brother of Elvis's grandfather.  The stunning loss last week of Roy Moore in deep-red Alabama has given Democrats new hope to do something once viewed as all but impossible: Win back the Senate majority. And to do that, they'll have to defend five of their incumbents in red states Donald Trump won handily in 2016. Plus, they'll have to pick up at least two GOP seats, and one of those seats almost certainly would have to be won in a state with a Republican-heavy electorate. RELATED: Poll: Half of voters want Democrats to control Congress Mississippi remains a long shot for Democrats, but they believe they can replicate the Alabama formula: Hope that the staunchly conservative Chris McDaniel challenges Sen. Roger Wicker in the GOP primary, leaving the Republican incumbent weakened -- or defeated -- for a general election against Presley. McDaniel, who lost a vicious Senate primary fight against Republican Sen. Thad Cochran in 2014, is not deterred. \"It's fair to say that I'm leaning strongly toward the US Senate seat,\" McDaniel, a state senator, told CNN. \"Anybody that understands the Deep South recognizes that for a Democrat to be successful, it's going to take the most egregious allegations imaginable to upend the race.\" That's music to the ears of Democrats, since Presley is only likely to run if there's a Republican primary. Asked if Presley could win a head-to-head race against Wicker, Thompson conceded: \"It will be tough.\" But he flashed a grin when asked about a matchup against McDaniel. \"I think when you picked flawed candidates, that is probably the biggest shortcoming,\" said Thompson, the state's lone congressional Democrat. \"Absolutely,\" a Democrat could win statewide, he said. Wicker says he's ready for all challengers and is prepared to mount an aggressive campaign for a third term. \"I've just been getting ready in general for a vigorous re-election,\" Wicker said.  A broader strategy, but overconfident? Democratic leaders say that the fight in the South is part of a broader strategy nationwide, vowing to compete all over the country.  Even if they don't win in conservative states, they hope that Trump's cascading unpopularity will turn the environment toxic for the GOP, forcing the party to spread thin its precious resources in a desperate fight to keep its narrow majority. \"We're going to be competing everywhere,\" said Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \"One of the lessons from (Alabama) is that we should compete everywhere -- and anything can happen.\" Still, Republicans say that Democrats are growing overconfident and are dubious they can raise the kind of money necessary to compete nationwide. There are still vulnerable Democrats who stand a serious shot of losing in Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia, Florida, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Montana.  Plus, they say that the Moore race was an anomaly: He was a highly controversial candidate with positions that put him on the far-right fringe -- compounded by accusations of sexual assault of minors and pursuing relationships with teenage girls. \"I think the Alabama race, what we saw there was a reaction to the candidate,\" said GOP Sen. Deb Fischer, who is up for re-election next year in the red state of Nebraska. Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said the Alabama race \"was about a candidate. It wasn't about an agenda.\" Gardner added: \"I feel very optimistic for 2018.\" Republicans, too, are confident they can hold onto open seats in deep red states, including if veteran Sen. Orrin Hatch retires in Utah.  In an interview, Hatch signaled he'd make a decision about his future in the new year, adding that he wants to run again while saying that he expected Mitt Romney to mount a bid if he retires. \"I'm leaning in favor of running, but you never know, my wife doesn't want me to run,\" Hatch, 83, told CNN. Asked about Romney's interest in running, Hatch said: \"I think he would -- I think if I hang it up, he might run. I would hope so if I do hang it up.\" Democrats on defense in Minnesota? The GOP hopes it can snag a seat in deep-blue Minnesota now that Sen. Al Franken is resigning amid allegations he touched women inappropriately. Republicans hope that the former governor, Tim Pawlenty, may be convinced to run for the open seat next year. \"I'm hoping Gov. Pawlenty does\" run, said former GOP Sen. Norm Coleman, who lost his seat to Franken in a 2008 cliffhanger.  Pawlenty told CNN last week that he is \"politically retired,\" even as he left the door open for a return. Arizona could go blue Republicans recognize that traditional GOP states are no slam-dunk in a year when polls show voters backing Democratic control of Congress by wide margins, including a Monmouth survey last week that shows a whopping 15-point preference for Democrats on the generic ballot. In Arizona, where Republicans could face a brutal Senate primary for the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, Democrats have a shot with a moderate Democrat, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. \"If you have a Democrat that runs a good campaign, and a Republican that just drills down on the base like the president does, that's not a good formula,\" Flake told CNN when asked about the Arizona race.  Asked if he thought Sinema could win, Flake said: \"I do.\" Moreover, Democrats believe that in two other red states -- Tennessee and Texas -- there's at least an outside shot of pulling off an upset, especially in Tennessee, where  former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen  is mounting a bid for the seat being vacated by Sen. Bob Corker, where another bitter GOP primary is shaping up. \"Gov. Bredesen's a well-respected former governor,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Republican from Tennessee. \"His biggest challenge will be persuading Tennesseans that they want to move Bob Corker's desk over to Chuck Schumer's side of the aisle.\" And in Texas, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat who is challenging Sen. Ted Cruz, says the results of the Alabama race gives voters a reason to believe that upsets are possible in unthinkable places, including his own. He says he's been campaigning in suburban, rural and ranching communities -- traditional GOP strongholds. \"Democrats haven't been showing up there; we're showing up,\" O'Rourke said. \"And people are turning out, so I'm really encouraged. And I think the only thing that's really changed is now many more people see that this is possible.\"","articles_date":"18 12 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/12\/18\/politics\/bloody-gop-primaries-democratic-hopes-senate-majority\/index.html","articles_title":"Bloody GOP primaries bolster Democratic hopes for Senate majority","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":31,"issue":8,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- The bodies of all 29 West Virginia coal miners killed in an explosion last week have been recovered from the mine, a spokeswoman for the state mine office said Tuesday. ADVERTISEMENT Jama Jarrett said the last bodies were taken out around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Tuesday and the bodies were being sent to the state medical examiner for autopsies. Recovery efforts had been stalled in previous days by volatile gases, but teams entered Monday after the tunnels were ventilated. The recovery of the remaining bodies, paves the way for federal investigators to enter the mine as they try to determine what caused the worst U.S. coal mining disaster since 1970. Investigators had not yet entered the mine early Tuesday, Jarrett said. The team of inspectors from the Mine Safety and Health Administration briefed Secretary of Labor   and MSHA director Joe Main at the Upper Big Branch mine Monday. The mine's owner, Richmond, Va.-based Massey Energy Co., has been under scrutiny for a string of safety violations at the mine, though CEO Don Blankenship has defended the company's record and disputed accusations that he puts profits ahead of safety. Authorities have said high methane levels may have played a role in the disaster. Massey has been repeatedly cited and fined for problems with the system that vents methane and for allowing combustible dust to build up. New York state's comptroller and a pension fund adviser called for Blankenship's resignation immediately as chairman of Massey's board. Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, trustee of a retirement fund holding more than 300,000 shares of Massey stock worth $14 million, said the company failed to adequately manage risks at the mine. A similar challenge came in a letter to Massey from William Patterson, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based CtW Investment Group, which works with union pension funds. Mourning continued Monday exactly a week after the explosion, with the ceremony at the state Capitol and a moment of silence at 3:30 p.m. President   ordered all U.S. flags in the state flown at half-staff until sunset Sunday. Virginia Gov.   also asked people in his state to observe the moment of silence. He restored $750,000 in funding for mine safety inspections in Virginia to the state's strained budget, saying the tragedy in West Virginia was a wakeup call.","articles_date":"13 04 2010","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2010\/04\/13\/bodies-recovered-west-virginia.html","articles_title":"Bodies of All 29 West Virginia Miners Recovered","candidate_fk":1,"first_name":"Don","id":32,"issue":6,"last_name":"Blankenship","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) With a large chunk of Republicans voting against  the spending deal early Friday morning  to end a brief government shutdown, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives needed a sizable group of Democrats to jump on board to pass the bill.

The American Conservative Union, which organizes the annual gathering, said it was \"disappointed\" that Trump \"decided at the last minute to drop out of CPAC,\" and that his absence would send \"a clear message to grassroots conservatives.\"  In 2017, Trump returned -- with a new job title -- and offered an olive branch. \"I love this place. I love you people,\" he said. \"I wouldn't miss a chance to talk to my friends.\" On Friday morning, a little less than two years since his infamous no-show, Trump arrived as promised. But the organization and movement he first encountered here in Maryland, just outside of Washington, DC, years ago, has changed.  It's still a circus, but Trump is now the unquestioned ringmaster.  From the paying attendees to the headliners on stage, CPAC's embrace of Trump -- both the man and his politics -- is complete. His enemies -- the \"crooked media\" and, still, Hillary Clinton -- are their own.  \"Remember when I first started running?\" he asked the audience on Friday morning. \"Because I wasn't a politician, fortunately. But you remember? I started running, and people say, 'Are you sure he's a conservative?' I think, now, we've proved that I'm a conservative, right?\" Through 13 months in office, Trump has delivered for that conservative base. Last year's tax cuts and his appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court typically lead the laundry list of his accomplishments. In return, CPAC attendees have committed to forgetting their outstanding concerns. Is Trump  actually  conservative? It's no longer a question here -- not because it's been answered, but because, well, there's no point in asking.    From well before Trump arrived on Friday morning, the main ballroom was his, and one only needed to glance at the roster of speakers on tap to confirm it. His Cabinet secretaries shuffled on and offstage, but the buzz belonged to a new crop of invitees, like the heiress to the French National Front's far right-wing political dynasty, Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, who warned on Thursday that her country \"is in the process of passing from the eldest daughter of the Catholic Church to the little niece of Islam.\" The line was met with a chorus of boos, but not for Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, who was rewarded with cheers throughout a brief speech meant to cast herself in common cause with Trump's nationalist politics.  \"I am not offended when I hear President Donald Trump say, 'America First,'\" she said. \"In fact, I want 'America First' for the American people, I want 'Britain First' for the British people, and I want 'France First' for the French people.\" By the time Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen was gone, Sebastian Gorka, the former White House official with no clear role apart from defending Trump on television, had already kicked off what would be a dayslong bid to capitalize on the minor celebrity the administration had gifted him. \"He was the rank outsider and he owes nothing to the swamp,\" Gorka said of the President, whom he routinely paints as a world historical figure, during a panel discussion. \"They're starting to understand that he won despite the right-wing establishment, not because of it.\" Before and after, for hours on end, Gorka cycled sternly through the wide hallways outside the main ballroom, greeting fans, being noticed and, at one point,  appearing to shove a reporter . Other old Trump allies made the scene, or came within a shout, including longtime confidante and adviser Roger Stone, who could be seen ducking into a restaurant across the street from the host hotel and convention center at around 5 p.m. on Thursday. Perhaps more telling than the paeans sung by Trump's allies, were the words of some of his old nemeses. The conservative writer and podcast host Ben Shapiro, who resigned from Breitbart during the 2016 campaign, gave a 30-minute speech that -- apart from a briefly scolding Trump for his handling of Charlottesville and a few other high-profile missteps -- praised and, in his way, seemed to emulate the President. After cheering Trump for delivering what he described as \"some of the most conservative governance of my lifetime,\" Shapiro then leveled a shot at a familiar foe. \"Most of all, President Trump brought us one really fantastic thing,\" he said. \"Hillary Clinton is not and will never be President of the United States.\" With that, a \"lock her up\" chant -- a staple of the campaign trail -- began to roll through the audience.  \"Why bother?\" Shapiro sneered, after allowing the rumbling to run its course. \"She's already in a jail of her own making somewhere in the woods of upstate New York.\"  The chorus would spring up again, less than 24 hours later, when Trump took his turn on the same stage. Floors down from the headliners, at the foot of a slow escalator not yet painted gold, Samantha Correia, the 21-year-old programs director for the Atlas Society and former California field director for Turning Point USA, a college conservative group, talked about her own evolution.  \"I started out as a huge fan of Marco Rubio, liked Scott Walker as well, and love-love-loved Ted Cruz,\" she said. Now, though, she was all in on Trump -- and channeling in her own words his unique blend of grievance and nostalgia for some notion of lost American \"greatness.\" \"What it comes down to,\" she explained, \"is conservatives are tired of being stepped on. Let's be honest here, we're in the United States of America. This is the greatest country that ever has existed and is the greatest country that exists, in my opinion. What established this country as so great, and why we're returning to an original greatness, is because of these ideals.\" That any CPAC gathering would attract strident partisans and ideological activists, even those who might not have known the event existed a year ago, is the norm. But in 2018, those \"outsiders\" aren't simply being welcomed, they're quickly taking over, placing its destiny firmly in their command. In the days before the conference kicked off, American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp fended off outside conservatives' worry (and anger) over Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen's appearance. But the fight never escalated beyond Twitter.  Schlapp, despite the group's early Trump skepticism, shifted his allegiances when the time was right -- well before his wife, Mercedes Schlapp, left her work as a conservative commentator last year to become, as her husband put it on Friday morning, \"a valued member of the President's White House team.\" For all the headline-grabbing churn and turnover in the administration, the pro-Trump business remains an appealing one to Republican political hands.     Erin Montgomery, now the communications director for America First Policies, left her post with Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a blue state Republican, to join the industry.  \"It's exciting to hear more and more people praising him and talking like him,\" she said. \"You have Rick Saccone, who's running in this Pennsylvania special election and he said, 'I was Trump before Trump was Trump.' It's an effective line! People like that.\" The taste for hyped-up rhetoric, crossed with trollish baiting of often unseen, yet fiercely maligned, political opponents, has also super-charged the rise of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.  Kirk and Turning Point USA's members are fierce culture warriors. Their stunts, and organization, offer a glimpse into the next generation of Trumpism, a politics with many of the same hang-ups but residing beneath a more composed exterior. Still, every now and then, the mask can slip. Kirk, during a panel discussion titled, \"Kim Jong Un-iversity: How College Campuses are Turning into Reeducation Camps,\" took aim at \"neomarxists\" and \"the Left.\" \"These are unhappy people,\"  Kirk said , his voice speeding up. \"These are people that are not upwardly aspirational, they hate this country, they don't want to defend what made it great.\"","articles_date":"23 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/23\/politics\/cpac-trump-takeover-2018\/index.html","articles_title":"CPAC goes full Trump for 2018","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":34,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) The first primaries of the 2018 midterms election season have arrived in Texas. There probably won't be any surprises in the Senate race there: Incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democrat Rep. Beto O'Rourke are clear favorites to win their respective primaries.  So the bigger question after tonight is whether O'Rourke, who  outraised Cruz last quarter  and has been  aggressively campaigning throughout the state , can ride a blue wave to victory in November. While O'Rourke certainly has a shot of winning, there are a number of reasons why Democrats should not get their hopes up.  1. Experts agree Cruz is heavily favored to win There hasn't been a lot of polling in the race (more on that in a moment), but observers mostly agree that Cruz is \"likely\" to win. That is, on a scale that goes solid to likely to lean to toss-up, Cruz's chances are more towards the \"solid\" than the \"toss-up\". This includes  CNN  in its race ratings, which has the race as likely Republican. But just what exactly does likely mean? My old colleague at  FiveThirtyEight Nate Silver went back  and looked at Senate races since 2010 to see how many times Senate races were won by the side that was \"likely\" to win in race ratings at this general point in the cycle.  The answer was 85% of the time. Now, saying that Cruz has an 85% chance of winning doesn't mean the race is over. It's approximately equivalent to a person tossing a coin three times in the air and it landing on heads each of those times. I'm sure you've seen that happen many times. Chances are, though, that it won't.  2. The fundamentals suggest Cruz is heavily favored When there's a general lack of polling, another way of determining the odds on a race is to look at the fundamentals. These include factors such as how the national environment looks (based on the generic ballot), whether the incumbent is running for reelection and the lean of the state on the presidential level (usually measured by examining the last two presidential races). While the generic ballot heavily favors Democrats, the other two factors don't. Cruz is an incumbent, and incumbents usually  receive an added boost . And remember, Donald Trump  won Texas by 9 , and Mitt Romney won it by 16. In other words, it's still a heavily Republican leaning state as far as we know.  When  statistician Dean Strachan looked  at these factors back in December, he gave Cruz an 84% chance of winning. That's quite similar to where the expert ratings put the race. A race O'Rourke could win -- though will probably not.  3. The scant polling that does exist favors Cruz  We have not had a non-partisan poll of the race that meets CNN standards in nearly a year. The two surveys that have been released in the past three months have been from a Democratic-leaning outside group and Cruz's own campaign. That doesn't leave us with a lot of confidence in the polling in the race. Still, both surveys had Cruz comfortably ahead -- and the average of the two gave Cruz a 14 percentage point advantage.  Until we get more surveys in the race, it's a little difficult to assess what exactly the polling is saying. Just remember that the January to June  polling average before the election  in Senate races from 2006 to 2014 had an average error of 6.8 percentage points, and a 14 point lead translates into winning 95% of the time. If the average poll over the next few months looks anything like it does now, O'Rourke's got a long road ahead of him. Of course, maybe O'Rourke closes in on Cruz after his likely win in the primary.  4. The likely voter population leans Republican  A number of analysts have pointed out to  Gallup's 2017 polling  to argue the race could be close. Gallup had Trump about as unpopular in Texas (approval rating of 39%) as he was nationally.  But as  I've noted before , Gallup's polling is of all adults. That's misleading to understanding the electorate in Texas. Trump's approval rating among voters is probably way higher.  Back in the fall of 2016, for example, Marist College polled nine states. They asked about then-President Barack Obama's approval rating. Democrat Obama's net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating) fell by 13 percentage points between the adult and likely voter population. That's more than any other state polled and more than twice the average state.   The reason Republicans do better in Texas among voters is fairly simple. First, the state's voting population is 14 points more white than the adult population, according to the Current Population Survey. Nationally, the average state's voting population is about 7 points more white than the adult population.  Additionally, voting patterns difference between whites and non-whites is greater than it is nationally.  Those two factors make Texas far more Republican leaning than you'd expect looking a poll of all adults.  5. The special election signal  You might think that the special elections so far this cycle are a good sign for O'Rourke. To the degree that they suggest a national environment that  leans heavily Democratic , they are.  On the other hand, there's something worrying about the special elections for O'Rourke as well.   The special elections have  followed a similar pattern : the 2012 presidential vote baseline has been far more telling than the 2016 presidential vote baseline. If that holds in Texas, it's a big problem for O'Rourke. The reason being that Texas was one of the few states where Democrats did better in 2016 than in 2012, even as the nation became more Republican leaning.   What O'Rourke needs to win is for voting patterns to follow 2016, and then receive an additional boost on top of that. That's certainly plausible. The vote patterns in the  2017 Virginia elections  looked a lot more like 2016 than 2012. But even there, Virginia Democratic candidates didn't do that much better than Clinton did in 2016. Put another way, O'Rourke is going to need pretty much everything to go right in order to win. It can happen, but it's a long shot.

Two women set the stage for history-making in West Virginia. ADVERTISEMENT Sasse, who had the backing of outside conservative groups as well as Sen. Ted Cruz and Sarah Palin, grabbed 48 percent of the vote in a five-man primary. Sid Dinsdale, the president of Pinnacle Bank, surged to second, while former State Treasurer Shane Osborn finished third. \"We were never doing this because we need another job,\" Sasse told supporters Tuesday night. \"We were only going to do this if we were going to talk about big, bold, conservative ideas.\" Outside groups pumped millions into the race for Sasse while allies of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., tried to propel Osborn to the nomination. With little to celebrate to date, conservative groups immediately trumpeted Sasse's victory. \"Ben Sasse won this race because he never stopped fighting for conservative principles,\" said Matt Hoskins, executive director of the Senate Conservatives Fund. The group spent more than $1.2 million to help Sasse. Cruz said Sasse's win \"is a clear indication that the grassroots are rising up to make D.C. listen.\" Voters in Nebraska and West Virginia decided their lineups for the November elections in the latest round of spring primaries. The fall midterms will determine control of Congress for the last two years of President Barack Obama's second term, with Republicans expected to hold the House and cautiously optimistic about winning control of the Senate. The GOP needs to net six seats to grab the majority In West Virginia, Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito and Democrat Natalie Tennant cruised to primary wins and will square off in a Senate showdown in November that will give the state its first female senator. Capito is a seven-term congresswoman and daughter of former Gov. Arch Moore; Tennant is the state's secretary of state. Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller is retiring after 30 years. West Virginia has become increasingly Republican, and Capito entered the general election contest as the heavy favorite. If elected, she would be the first Republican senator from West Virginia since 1959. In Nebraska, Sasse, who heads Midland University, had the backing of the Tea Party Patriots and FreedomWorks in his bid to replace Republican Sen. Mike Johanns, who is retiring after a single six-year term. Sasse had focused on his conservative credentials, opposition to abortion, support for gun rights and goal of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. In one 30-second ad, Sasse's two young daughters, Alex and Corrie, talk about how much their dad opposes the Affordable Care Act. \"He wants to destroy it,\" says one daughter. \"He despises it,\" says the other. While Sasse won over tea partyers, he offered voters some significant establishment credentials. He served as an assistant secretary in the Health and Human Services Department in President George W. Bush's administration, studied at Harvard and Yale, and was a visiting scholar in economics at the Brookings Institution. Sasse is a heavy favorite against Democratic nominee Dave Domina in the Republican-leaning state. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which had remained neutral, called Sasse a \"problem-solver who will be a conservative voice\" to repeal the health care law. The tea party has struggled this year as candidates have lost to establishment favorites in Texas, North Carolina and Ohio, and Nebraska stood as the insurgent movement's best remaining shot. Looking ahead to upcoming primaries, the tea party's chances to upset incumbents have been diminishing in Kentucky, Kansas, Idaho and Mississippi. The Republican establishment has a love-hate relationship with the tea party. It welcomed the movement's energy that propelled the GOP to control of the House in the 2010 elections, but it blames tea partyers for less-than-viable general election candidates in 2010 and 2012 Senate races in Indiana, Colorado, Nevada and Delaware. Republicans in the capital remain convinced they could have won control of the Senate if only their establishment candidates had won more primaries, and some in the party have been determined to defeat the movement's candidates this election. In Nebraska's GOP primary for governor, Omaha businessman Pete Ricketts narrowly defeated Attorney General Jon Bruning. Term limits prevented Republican Gov. Dave Heineman from running again. In West Virginia, Democratic names like Byrd and Rockefeller dominated politics for decades, but since 2000, the state has voted Republican in presidential elections. The transformation is widely expected to continue this fall as Republicans capitalize on voter antipathy toward Obama, who lost all of the state's 55 counties in 2012. Capito's planned departure from the House created a messy GOP primary in her 2nd Congressional District that stretches across the state. Alex Mooney, the former chairman of the Maryland GOP who moved to West Virginia, captured the nomination in a seven-candidate race and will face Democrat Nick Casey, the former state party chairman of West Virginia, in the fall. In his appeal to voters, Mooney's campaign said he moved to West Virginia to \"live in freedom, and he'll fight Obama to preserve it.\" One of the most endangered House Democrats is 19-term Rep. Nick Rahall, who easily won his primary and will face Democrat-turned-Republican Evan Jenkins in the fall.","articles_date":"14 05 2014","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2014\/05\/14\/candidate-backed-by-sen-ted-cruz-wins-gop-primary-for-nebraska-senate.html","articles_title":"Candidate Backed By Sen.

Stewart, a trade attorney and chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, is challenging frontrunner Ed Gillespie in Virginia's Republican primary for governor. Stewart has  made  defending Virginia's history as a Confederate state during the Civil War a visible issue in his campaign and, on his website, has  referred  to calls to remove statues of prominent Confederate figures as 'historical vandalism.' After Stewart concluded a fiery speech defending the Confederate Flag and southern heritage at the event in Danville, Virginia, Richard Hines, the chairman of Save Southern Heritage, joined Stewart and expressed the group's support for his campaign. \"I'm Richard Hines of Save Southern Heritage, and I want you to know here tonight Save Southern Heritage, we had endorsed Donald Trump in the presidential primaries and we endorse Corey Stewart,\" Hines said in a video from the event  uploaded  on Facebook. Hines added that Stewart's opponent Gillespie would take down statues of Robert E. Lee in Virginia. (A spokesperson for Gillespie told the Washington Post that Gillespie doesn't support the removal of statues but believes it is a local issue.) \"We have a fighting chance to elect Corey Stewart and I suggest we do,\" Hines said.  Stewart thanked Hines for his remarks. Hines founded Save Southern Heritage during the 2015 debate over whether to remove the Confederate flag from South Carolina state grounds after a white supremacist killed 9 black parishioners at a church in Charleston. It describes itself on its website as a \"a voluntary association of individuals who revere the south, southern history and southern heritage.\" The group adds that it \"does not condone racism and as such we do not support any group or person that does.\"   Hines, 68, has long been a leading figure in what is known as the neo-Confederate movement, which seeks to promote a more sympathetic view of the Confederate states during the Civil War. Scholars of the movement actually  point  to a reference to Hines in the neo-Confederate magazine Southern Partisan as one of the first uses of the term. Hines himself was a  contributor  to the magazine for  decades  and is credited as \"assistant editor\" in a  1980s masthead . In  one  article, he defended the historical reputation of Rep. Preston Brooks for the infamous caning of Massachusetts Sen. Charles Sumner on the Senate floor. In the 1990s, Hines carried a Confederate flag down a street in Richmond to protest a statue to the late black tennis star Arthur Ashe Jr. being erected among other monuments that honored prominent Confederate figures. Hines is quoted by the Associated Press as saying, \"The intent of the placement of the statue was to debunk our heritage.\" More recently, Hines attacked former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for supporting the removal of the Confederate flag from state grounds.  In a letter to the  editor  of the Spartanburg Herald Journal, Hines called Haley \"South Carolina's Sikh-Hindu governor\" and he has repeatedly called Haley a  traitor  in videos and on his  website . \"Nikki Haley, South Carolina's Sikh-Hindu governor, opened a Pandora's Box of cultural genocide last June against all things Southern,\" Hines wrote. \"Since her Columbia appearance with Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, building, street, and highway names have changed, accompanied by flag bans, monument removals, and efforts to remove Southern names from military bases and high schools.\" Hines did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment. Stewart defended Hines's endorsement in a statement to CNN's KFile. \"The media's obsession with vilifying conservatives -- whether it's calling Americans who want immigration controls bigots, slandering those who push for school choice as anti-teacher, or claiming those who seek to block-grant medicaid to the states want to push granny off a cliff -- is the very reason we're not going to apologize for standing up against the oppressive political correctness the leftist media uses in its impotent attempt to silence their political opponents.\"","articles_date":"17 4 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/17\/politics\/kfile-corey-stewart-richard-hines\/index.html","articles_title":"Candidate for Virginia governor was endorsed by prominent neo-Confederate at 'Old South Ball'","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":37,"issue":8,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Congress is a mess.

A maze of office chairs haphazardly abandoned in the basement of Longworth. A series of 22 black-and-silver file cabinets line a wall in a tunnel below Cannon. No fewer than 18 separate pieces of office furniture -- from bookshelves to desks to chairs to lamps to TV sets each festooned with a computer-printed sign reading \u201cPlease Remove\u201d -- occupy Cannon\u2019s second floor. Making law is messy. But legislating is nothing compared to what goes into making Capitol Hill ready for a new Congress to next week. Hundreds of congressional offices are on the move. More senior lawmakers matriculating to more commodious suites. Retiring or defeated lawmakers ceding their offices.

It\u2019s probably shuttered and hasn\u2019t been visited in days if a prodigious stack of newspapers, all bound together with twine, blocks the doorway. You\u2019ll find copies of The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, New York Times and USA Today. The office of Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, includes a copy of Investor\u2019s Business Daily. Someone in Rayburn raided a copy of The Washington Post from the stash of papers deposited outside the office of Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif. Perhaps they actually just wanted the ads. Parts of the paper are strewn about the hallway. And perhaps they only wanted some of the ads. A Walgreen\u2019s flier remains, splayed open, on the floor as well. Some congressional offices feature seasonal decorations besides the newspaper stacks. A large holiday wreath adorns the main entranceway to the office belonging to Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., on the fourth floor of Rayburn. Over on the sixth floor of Longworth, the doors to the office of Rep. Grace Napolitano, D-Calif., are dressed in wrapping paper. One door is emblazoned with a toy soldier pattern. The other with Christmas trees. A welcome mat reading \u201cJoy!\u201d rests at the base of the door in place of the de rigueur newspaper stacks found at other offices. Any item someone could possibly use in an office can now be found in the hallways. Appliances are particularly big. In Rayburn, eight Toshiba and RCA TV\u2019s are stacked up in the basement. Several \u201cMicro Fridges\u201d are stowed in the hall between the offices of Reps. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz., and Kathy Castor, D-Fla., in Longworth. Four floor lamps stand erect (sans shades), a coat tree and three couches without cushions are found in the hall by the office of Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas. Back in the Rayburn basement, one can stumble upon a comically high stack of what must be hundreds of plastic carpet protectors for rolling chairs, latched together with plastic straps. Two large canisters of Ricoh toner -- one yellow, one red -- stand upright in a corner. Around another bend sits a stack of broken down table legs strung together like cordwood. A black office chair is tagged with a special sticker reading \u201cClean in Place.\u201d Someone scribbled in Magic Marker on the underside of a desk \u201cPierluisi 1217.\u201d Another piece of furniture bears a similar inscription in ink. \u201cContact Angeline, 1213.\u201d Several office dividers feature tags reading \u201cPaint all ceilings\u201d and \u201cGetting new paint.\u201d A discarded map of Colorado lies against a wall nearby. Late December transforms congressional corridors into a bizarre treasure trove. It\u2019s like some twisted scavenger hunt, worthy of urban explorers who usually spend their time spelunking abandoned sanitariums and subway stations. Stroll past the line of Allsteel file cabinets in the Cannon basement and you\u2019ll find various drawers labeled \u201cApprops\u201d (short for Appropriations, the committee that determines how to spend federal dollars). Someone slapped a \u201cColorado Brewers Guide\u201d sticker on one cabinet. A sticker for \u201cBetelnut Radio\u201d is affixed to another drawer (some research reveals that Betelnut Radio is an online radio station featuring Polynesian and island music). Other drawers are categorized as Obama Flags, Military Special Projects, Press and Empty. Another drawer features a sign reading A Young Person\u2019s Guide to the U.S. Capitol. A Capitol worker ambles by and pulls open a few of the drawers just to see if there are any contents inside. He finds nothing. The file cabinets may yield little of value. But that\u2019s not always the case when it comes to the hallways of Congress. Some seemingly innocuous items are quite valuable (to the unscrupulous eye) -- if someone knows what to look for. In the new Congress, Room 1213 of the Longworth House Office Building will belong to Rep.-elect Gwen Graham, D-Fla. In fact Graham\u2019s name is already stamped on the nameplate. Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, a Democrat and the non-voting delegate to Congress from Puerto Rico, previously held this office and has now abandoned it for other digs. Yet sitting against one of the doors is a tall stack of oversized yellow-orange envelopes. Pierluisi's pre-printed signature is etched in the upper right-hand corner where a stamp belongs. This is what\u2019s called a congressional \u201cfrank,\u201d authorized by the Constitution. A franking privilege is where lawmakers can send official mail by simply scribbling their name on the envelope to cover the postage. That\u2019s how members did it in the old days. Now all of the stationary and envelopes come with the name already inscribed. And franked envelopes lying askew in the hall could tempt an ethically-challenged someone who may want to send out some official mail. The office of Rep.-elect Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., on the sixth floor of Longworth also presents an interesting offering. The office is locked up tight. But there on top of a copy of The Washington Times rests a pair of maroon, women\u2019s flats with a little bow above the toe -- there for the taking. The Cannon House Office Building has five floors. And the fifth has long been considered to be the equivalent of Congressional Siberia. The offices are generally more cramped, less opulent and even have a series of steel \u201ccages\u201d across the hall where some aides and interns toil. And it\u2019s hard to get to that floor. Not all of the elevators in the building travel to the top floor. Some detractors -- sometimes not-so-jokingly - say the elevator deficiency is a metaphor for the people who work on the fifth floor. A lot in Congress is based on seniority. So it\u2019s no surprise that freshmen lawmakers are\u00a0relegated to Cannon\u2019s fifth floor. And when they gain seniority, many desert this stratum as fast as they can. For this Congress, Reps. Dan Benishek, R-Mich., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., begin their third terms in Congress as fifth-floor holdovers. But many other senior lawmakers left. New occupants will include freshman Reps.-elect Tom Emmer, R-Minn., David Young, R-Iowa, Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., Norma Torres, D-Calif., and Evan Jenkins, R-W.V. \u00a0 Grothman\u2019s office features a sign declaring that \u201cCongressman Swalwell has Moved to 129 Cannon.\u201d Young\u2019s doorway carries a similar message informing visitors that \u201cThe office of Rep. Alan Lowenthal has Moved to 108 Cannon HOB.\u201d And then there is 512 Cannon. Freshman Rep.-elect Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is setting up shop here. But for now, her door bears this message: \u201cTHE OFFICE OF MICHAEL G. GRIMM (NY-11) HAS MOVED TO 1725 LONGWORTH.\u201d And sure enough, Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., who pleaded guilty last week to felony tax evasion and is now planning to resign, is now over in Longworth. For the time being. Three signs can be found outside Grimm\u2019s office. One announces that the office is closed through \u201cMonday, December 21.\u201d Another instructs those wishing to reach Grimm\u2019s office to phone the district office on Staten Island \u201cif there is an emergency.\u201d And finally, a third sign informs visitors dogs are sometimes present inside. \u201cPlease Enter with Care,\u201d reads the sign. \u00a0 \u00a0","articles_date":"01 01 2015","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2015\/01\/01\/recess-mess-capitol-hill-buried-in-clutter-days-before-new-congress.html","articles_title":"Capitol Hill buried in clutter, days before new Congress ","candidate_fk":3,"first_name":"Evan","id":38,"issue":6,"last_name":"Jenkins","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) At least one anonymous person with a Capitol Hill internet connection is making near-constant edits on Wikipedia, dropping trolling messages into several articles in front of an online audience. The edits range from inserting random spaces in some articles to adding to the captions on the page for a hamburger chain and dropping in a meme about GOP Sen. Ted Cruz into articles related to the Kennedy assassination. And it has gotten pretty meta. The Wikipedia   edits came to light thanks to  @congressedits , a Twitter bot that generates updates whenever it detects someone from the House or Senate -- members, staff or anyone using an internet connection associated with the Hill -- making an edit to Wikipedia. The account largely shows what one might expect, someone polishing a member of Congress' page or slanting something political. But mixed in are plenty of moves well outside of the Beltway, from folk music to science fiction, and this week, the account provided updates for some self-referential vandalism on Wikipedia from the House of Representatives, or at least internet connections associated with it. BuzzFeed published  an article  on Wednesday, saying it looked like someone in Congress was trolling the CongressEdits bot, and after publication, at least one of the apparent editors added \"They'll never find me\" to the article about BuzzFeed.  On Thursday, the editor or editors picked up the pace. In a series of left-leaning additions, one edit  claimed  the University of Maryland chapter of Our Revolution, the organization for Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' political movement, is \"the best chapter out there.\" Reached via email by CNN, that chapter's president said he did not know who was doing the edits. \"I just checked with the only intern I am aware of that we have on the Hill, and he fervently denied editing those pages,\" wrote chapter president Christopher Walkup. Adding to the mystery was another edit on Thursday, this time to the \"List of Impostors\" article. The editor with a House IP  added  to the list of fraudsters \"whoever else is making these edits,\" suggesting more than one person was involved in the ongoing vandalism. Shortly after, someone  dropped into  the article for \"Narcissism,\" writing \"whoever thinks they have a monopoly on this shiz.\"  Bad behavior on Wikipedia has earned the Hill blocks from editing in the past ,  and the latest spate of bad edits was no different. A Wikipedia administrator  blocked  an IP address associated with the House of Representatives for 31 hours, following the \"narcissism\" edit -- putting at least a temporary stop to the trolling.  \"Blocks can be applied by Wikipedia administrators -- senior, trusted volunteers selected by the community -- when Wikipedia policies are repeatedly violated by a user account or IP address,\" Wikimedia spokesperson Elise Flick told CNN. The Wikipedia  page  for \"Congressional staffer edits\" notes a history of productive and unproductive behavior from Congress. The uptick in trolling this week is just the latest in years' worth of questionable changes from Capitol Hill to the free encyclopedia. People using Capitol Hill internet have called the character Boba Fett from Star Wars overrated. A couple of edits kept up with The Mountain Goats and the band's front man John Darnielle. And on a few occasions, people have apparently tried to sanitize history, editing a description of the southern strategy and trying to change an article on the Senate torture report.","articles_date":"19 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/19\/politics\/congress-edits-wikipedia\/index.html","articles_title":"Capitol Hill is making a mess on Wikipedia","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":39,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"ADVERTISEMENT BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Joining us now in our Center Seat, we welcome Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Senator, thank you for being here. SEN. JOE MANCHIN, D - WV: Thanks for having me. BAIER: Just passed the budget over the procedural hurdle known as cloture, likely to pass easily in final vote here over the next day.\u00a0 What about this? A lot of the concern from Republicans was that it takes from military pensions, and they say, like Senator Graham, that, well, it is just not fair. What do you say to him? MANCHIN: Well first of all, I've been a Bowles-Simpson supporter from day one since I've gotten here three years ago, and I would like to see a bigger deal, because I've always believed that you have to put your financial house in order before you can do anything. I did it when I was governor and let everything else go by the wayside until I knew that we could take care of our priorities based on our values. That's just the way I think it should be done, and we're not getting there.\u00a0 So which what happened with the budget, we didn't get a perfect budget. It is the first resemblance of any type of a budget, the process that we have that kind of resembles something of normal order going through appropriations. And with that, we're going to work hard to try to fix that with the military. It is the one percent COLA reduction -- anyone under 62. And you can say those are promises we made and we should be able to keep and you would think in normal times we should. But everybody is vulnerable right now and we have to go try to fix that. But it is what was in front of us, and we don't have any options of walking away and going into a shutdown again. BAIER: Like Graham and Ayotte, these senators say if there is anybody we should be protecting to find $6 billion a year, it is the military. MANCHIN: We all feel that way. But the bottom line is, with this being said, that was one of the things worked out between the Democrats and Republicans, and you had 333 vote in the House with that there, and I think we don't have a chance to amend anything. So do you want to go through a shutdown process, is where we would be, or do you move forward and try to fix it when we come back? BAIER: Charles? CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Senator, on the budget, we seem to be through that. But what we're looking at now is a debt ceiling. We heard Republicans saying they will not let it go by without something being done or something -- if you want to use the word, extracted. Do you think there should be a clean debt ceiling or do you think it would be right for the Congress to use the occasion to do something to reduce our indebtedness? MANCHIN: Yeah, I'm probably not the right Democrat to ask about a clean debt ceiling because I have not voted. I had to \u2013 I got caught in a procedural vote to move it forward. I really think that you have to come to grips with it. KRAUTHAMMER: And what would you like to see happen at the debt ceiling? MANCHIN: Well, again, a bigger picture needs to be looked at. And that is when the Bowles-Simpson came in. Charles, as you know, they looked at revenue, they looked at expenditures, they looked at reforms. And all of that has to be taken into consideration. You can't put one side in the box. And what we are doing now, we are just making you vote and take score, trying to use it against you. I would rather fix something, and we have to get together here and come to grips with it. We have to have some reforms. KRAUTHAMMER: But there is no way that would happen before a debt ceiling? MANCHIN: The debt ceiling is going to come, right, and there is going to be something put on the table I think by the Republicans. KRAUTHAMMER: What would you like to see? MANCHIN: I would like to see long-term reductions, I would like to see a downward path to at least a balanced budget. As a former governor, that is the first thing when we ask the question going into the capitals is, what is the revenue? Once you know the revenues you know what your spending limits are. There is no such control such as that here. So as a Democrat, and we have many Democrats I believe that would like to see balanced budgets. No one thought we could do it in the 90's and they did it working with a Republican Congress and a Democrat president and it got accomplished. I think we could do it again. I think it could be the greatest confidence builder this country every had to our economy. GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: How do you get to a balanced budget when the deal we just had makes no dent at all in the trajectory of the country and the entitlement state, and your party which whom you are notoriously discordant on occasions, flinches even from even the chained CPI, that is a tiny little adjustment of the way we calculate inflation. If they can't do that, what can they do about the entitlement state? MANCHIN: Well, George, it makes look at how we operate the entitlements, not looking at taking anyone's benefits away from them. But are the people getting benefits that shouldn't have gotten them? People -- are they getting them under false pretenses and there is no review back for total disability -- for Social Security, disabilities? There is so many things in fraud, waste, and abuse, if we could just get agreement to really go after that, it would be, I think, a blessing. And why people are afraid -- my concern is, is it going to be there for the next generation? When you look at Social Security, they say if we don't do anything, 2035 or 2037 maybe, and on Medicare is much worse, 2024 or 2026, and then also Social Security disability, 2016. So I don't know how far they can kick the down or how much longer. Sooner over later you got to pay the piper. WILL: But every day 10,000 more baby boomers become eligible for Social Security and Medicare. And you are on the committee on aging and you speak eloquently about taking care of the elderly, but the welfare is an enormous regressive transfer of wealth to the most affluent age cohort in the country, the elderly, who after a lifetime of accumulation are better off than the young and middle aged people who are paying all these benefits? MANCHIN: I've always been partial to a means testing. I've always looked at means testing from the standpoint of fairness to it. And I always said my parents worked hard and they were in a little better shape and I've had other relatives that have needed a little bit more assistance, and I don't think my parents would begrudge them whatsoever on the means tested if there's had been a little bit different than someone in more need. WILL: But the Democratic mantra has been Ted Kennedy's axiom that a program for the poor is a program, because if your means test -- it will look like a program for the poor and the middle class will withdraw its support. Do you reject that? MANCHIN: Well, we've never tried it so I don't know if it will work. WILL: We have to try something different. JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: So the Democrats \u2013 from the Democrat's perspective on this budget, senator, the complaint has been in order to get Republican votes you could not extend unemployment insurance for those who had long-term unemployment. And therefore, that's the deal that had to be made. But what about people in West Virginia, long-term uninsured, as George Will pointed out early, people still say we are in a recession, how do you feel about not helping them in this Christmas season? MANCHIN: Juan, I don't think anyone, I mean, you look at it as not being compassionate about people looking for work. You need to look at state by state, what their conditions are. Some states have lower unemployment and some states have higher. They have four tiers right they work within, their one, two, three, and four. We qualify in West Virginia for one, two, and three, not four. And with that being said, I understand today Dean Heller, our Republican from Nevada, and you had Jack Reed from Rhode Island, are talking about some type of compassionate three-month extension to some of this. But sooner or later, I would just ask when is that unemployment going to be acceptable to when we go back to normal order of 26 weeks?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 WILLIAMS: Well, that's understandable, but I think part of the conversation taking place on the Hill is will Republicans ever accept tax hikes in this current environment, or is that absolutely never going to happen, can you never make a deal with Republicans in which you would say, here, we'll cut some programs but we need some revenue enhancement? MANCHIN: Juan, here is the thing. We are just trying to get agreement on the definition of revenue. Is revenue when you increase taxes? To me that's revenue. If it is 35 and goes to 36 or 37, that is new revenue. If it is at 35 percent and you go to 31 but you have efficiencies, you close loopholes, and offset some credits and efficiencies, is that revenue? And then if they say, well, that is different. Well, if it's different you are still concerned with how we spend it. Couldn't Democrats and Republicans agree that we have one tremendous debt problem in our country and they are going to say for every new dollar of revenue, no matter how we get it, 60 or 70 cents will go to debt reduction. The remainder goes to infrastructure, nothing to grow the programs out.\u00a0 We live within our means, we run it more efficiently.\u00a0 BAIER: Senator if you stand by, we have another segment coming up.\u00a0 More with Senator Manchin, ObamaCare and other issues after a quick time-out.","articles_date":"18 12 2013","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/transcript\/2013\/12\/18\/center-seat-sen-manchin-budget-deal-future-entitlement-programs.html","articles_title":"Center Seat: Sen.

Clinton's buy arrives a few days before a return visit by vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine to the state on Tuesday, and is an attempt in part to shore up the Wisconsin Senate race, where Russ Feingold enjoys a solid lead over incumbent Ron Johnson. A media buying source said that the initial reservations by the campaign were small, and the Clinton campaign described it as merely a \"six-figure\" buy. \"Wisconsin Democrats have competitive races to win across the state and Hillary Clinton is committed to electing Russ Feingold and Democrats up and down the ballot to help her make a real difference for families in Wisconsin,\" said Clinton state director Jake Hajdu. The buys could represent some concern about Clinton's performance in the state, but could also be merely a luxury investment given the $62 million in the campaign's coffers as of Oct. 20. Clinton herself has not visited Wisconsin during the general election and Kaine hasn't been there since August. Although Donald Trump once professed the state as part of his path to victory, Clinton has consistently held a 5- to 10-point lead there. The Clinton investment also coincides with increased GOP attention to Johnson, who has largely been abandoned by national Republicans in favor of other competitive Senate races. Some polls have shown Johnson's support growing, and the super PAC aligned with Democratic leadership, Senate Majority PAC, said Friday that they would begin a $2 million campaign in the state on Monday after being absent from the airwaves.","articles_date":"28 10 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/10\/28\/politics\/hillary-clinton-wisconsin-ads\/index.html","articles_title":"Clinton aims to shore up Wisconsin with new TV ads","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":41,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton's decision to campaign in Michigan, a traditionally blue state, one day before Election Day is a \"reflection of the voting calendar\" and not a sign that the campaign is worried about Donald Trump cracking Clinton's blue wall, Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN\"s \"New Day\" Monday. \"Our strategy these last few days is to focus on the states where voting overwhelmingly happens on election day,\" Mook told CNN's Alisyn Camerota, pointing to New Hampshire, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio.

The rally, which is expected to be one of Clinton's biggest of the campaign, acknowledges the importance of Pennsylvania -- and the Philadelphia area -- to Clinton's campaign. Clinton has spent seven days campaigning in Pennsylvania since the Democratic National Convention and aides feel a win in Pennsylvania will severely limit Trump's path to the presidency.

Clinton's pivot is an unmistakable sign that she and her top aides have never felt more confident about victory on November 8. The Democratic nominee's path to 270 electoral votes has drastically widened in the course of a few weeks, as she has pulled ahead in battleground states and made gains in traditionally Republican strongholds like  Utah  and  Arizona . Trump -- weighed down by  a stream of controversies  surrounding his past treatment of women -- has only further alienated himself from fellow Republicans with his stubborn refusal to say he will accept the results of the election. Determined to capitalize on her opponent's recent struggles, Clinton has picked up her pace of campaigning, and in the final two weeks of the 2016 race, she will crisscross the country to vouch for Democrats in tough congressional races. Her ultimate goal is to secure a Democratic-controlled Senate -- crucial to a Clinton administration's ability to set an aggressive first-term agenda. RELATED: The tumultuous 2016 campaign is in a sudden limbo Clinton kicked off the week by traveling north to Manchester, New Hampshire, where she joined forces with popular liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren to slam Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte. The first-term senator  is facing a tough reelection  against the state's Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. \"Unlike her opponent, she has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump,\" Clinton said of Hassan. \"She knows he shouldn't be a role model for our kids or anybody else, for that matter.\" Warren also skewered Ayotte, pointing out the senator's vacillating support for Trump. \"Day one she loves him, day two she hates him, day three, she' back with him -- boy, spins round and round,\" she said. And in reference to Trump calling Clinton a  \"nasty woman\"  in the final debate, Warren added: \"Nasty women are tough. Nasty women are smart. And nasty women vote.\" Warren's comments exemplified how deeply some down-ballot Republicans are feeling the consequences of having drawn ambiguous lines around Trump, even as he repeatedly made offensive remarks. Elizabeth Warren: Trump thinks 'a mouth full of Tic Tacs' means he can 'force himself on any woman' Earlier this month, Ayotte  said during a debate  that she would \"absolutely\" point to her party's nominee as a role model for children -- remarks that drew immediate criticism and that Ayotte swiftly walked back, saying she \"misspoke.\" Ayotte ultimately pulled her support for Trump altogether after the unveiling of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump was caught discussing in crude terms groping women without their consent.  Clinton's focus on down-ballot races marks a stark contrast from even a few weeks ago, when the former secretary of state was solely focused on her own race, including raising money and preparing for three general election debates against Trump.  Over the past few days, Clinton has looked to boost Democratic candidates in part by condemning their Republican opponents who have either stood by Trump or have not outright disavowed him. Clinton needs a Democratic Senate to serve as a firewall against a House of Representatives that will likely remain under GOP control next year. Having a majority in the Senate will be key in allowing Clinton to bring up her top legislative priorities in Congress, and help shepherd through Clinton's executive and judicial appointments. On Saturday in Pennsylvania, both Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine,  slammed GOP Sen. Pat Toomey  for not rejecting Trump. They argued that Toomey was making a selfish political calculation that showed he would not stand with Pennsylvania voters -- many of whom are opposed to the Republican presidential nominee. RELATED: GOP lawmaker: Move to oust Ryan grows over speaker's tepid support of Trump After listing some of Trump's more salacious and controversial comments, Clinton said: \"If (Toomey) doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all of this, then can you be sure that he will stand up for you when it counts?\" Clinton then traveled to North Carolina on Sunday, where she touted Democratic Senate candidate Deborah Ross as \"exactly that kind of partner I need in the United States Senate.\" \"She will help me break through the gridlock,\" Clinton said, making an explicit reference to what is expected to be a closely divided Congress next year.   Top Democratic surrogates -- including President Barack Obama -- are deploying the same strategy.   Campaigning for Patrick Murphy, Florida's Democratic Senate candidate, earlier this month,  Obama lambasted GOP Sen. Marco Rubio  for standing with Trump. \"How can you call him a con artist and dangerous and object to all the controversial things he says, and then say, 'I'm still going to vote for him?'\" Obama said earlier this month. \"Come on, man!\"","articles_date":"25 10 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/10\/24\/politics\/hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-kelly-ayotte\/index.html","articles_title":"Clinton turns fire on down ballot Republicans","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":44,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"LOGAN, W.Va. \u2014 The devastating explosion in the Upper Big Branch coal mine  killed 29 men in 2010  and scarred West Virginia like few events in modern memory. Don Blankenship, the head of the mining company, went to prison over it. Not many people would call that a springboard for a career in politics. Yet when Mr. Blankenship emerged last year from his one-year sentence for conspiracy to violate mine safety laws, rather than express remorse or contrition over the tragedy, he announced a run for the United States Senate, in a state where coal has been as much a cultural identity as an economic one. His return to the public eye has reawakened painful memories in West Virginia, especially for relatives of the disaster\u2019s victims. \u201cYou took 29 lives away from families like mine,\u201d said Judy Jones Petersen in an interview, as if she were addressing Mr. Blankenship. Her brother, Dean Jones, was killed in the disaster. \u201cShame on you for coming back,\u201d she said. At one of Mr. Blankenship\u2019s meet-and-greet events with voters, a knot of protesters held signs: \u201cYou must be joking.\u201d But in the coal fields, many people don\u2019t think his candidacy is a joke at all. He has found support there for his claim to be a victim himself, pursued unfairly by federal prosecutors and mine safety inspectors. He brazenly calls himself a former \u201cpolitical prisoner.\u201d \u201cThey railroaded him,\u201d said Steve Blair, a retiree who worked in mines run by Mr. Blankenship when he was the chief executive of the Massey Energy Company, once the largest coal producer in central Appalachia. \u201cThe federal government turned everybody loose to testify against him, just to get rid of him.\u201d Mr. Blair, 61, wearing a West Virginia University cap, forked up his steak and eggs at a Bob Evans restaurant recently in Logan. The town, once a Democratic stronghold, is emblematic of how vehemently voters in Appalachia have rejected the national party: Mr. Blair voted for Barack Obama in 2008, but four years later, the sitting president lost the Democratic primary in Logan County to a protest candidate in a Texas prison. A burly man who is certain in his views, Mr. Blair had a ready explanation for the long decline of the coal industry. \u201cOne word: Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cI was put out of business by Obama.\u201d Mr. Blankenship claims that the federal government, not the coal company, is to blame for the explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine near Montcoal, W.Va. Investigators found no evidence to support his claims, but he is running for office in an era of nationwide voter credulity for conspiracy theories. And his candidacy is unfolding in a state where many people embrace a sense of persecution over coal\u2019s decline. Economists say that a host of factors are responsible, chiefly the abundance of cheap natural gas, which has undercut coal in the energy marketplace. But that is not what many West Virginians choose to hear. \u201cWhat hurt coal was the Obama administration and nothing else,\u201d said Denny Harton, a retired business owner who introduced Mr. Blankenship recently at one of his rallies. Dianne Dewey White, chairwoman of the Republican Party of Logan County, said thousands of miners who once looked to Mr. Blankenship for work are likely to support him now. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe what good parties they had, and what times they had,\u201d she said. \u201cThey spent a lot of good years with him. People don\u2019t forget that.\u201d Coal barons like Mr. Blankenship used to be despised in Logan County, a rugged region in southern West Virginia. The Battle of Blair Mountain happened here in 1921, when miners seeking to unionize clashed with a private army fielded by mine owners, and more than 50 people died. But as West Virginia has become a deep-red state, the sympathies of many mine families have shifted from unions to mine operators, who are portrayed as job creators. \u201cI have heard people say, \u2018When Don was in charge, we always worked,\u2019\u201d said R. Booth Goodwin II, who prosecuted Mr. Blankenship as a United States attorney and then ran for governor unsuccessfully in 2016. \u201cThe coal industry is still perpetuating a lie that coal mining is coming back, and it\u2019s going to be just like it was before, when all objective evidence is to the contrary,\u201d he said. Mr. Blankenship, 67, is up against two more conventional candidates \u2014 Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Representative Evan Jenkins \u2014 in the Republican primary in May. He said he is prepared to spend whatever it takes on the race, and his pockets are deep: In his last years at Massey Energy, he was reportedly paid  $38.2 million.  Opponents who once dismissed his candidacy now see him as a credible threat in the Trump era, positioned to appeal to many West Virginians\u2019 resentment of elites of any kind. \u201cThere\u2019s a pride in the state, deep inside, that comes from people dumping on it so long,\u201d said an aide to Senator Joe Manchin III, the Democratic incumbent who will face the winner of the Republican primary in November. Mr. Manchin once said that Mr. Blankenship  \u201chas blood on his hands\u201d  because of Upper Big Branch, the worst mining disaster in the United States in 40 years. Some West Virginians speculate that Mr. Blankenship is running to pursue a vendetta against Mr. Manchin, who was governor at the time the mine exploded. Although Mr. Manchin is the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, he is still expected to face a tough re-election race in the state, where Donald J. Trump won 68 percent of the vote in 2016. Mr. Blankenship dismisses talk of a vendetta. \u201cIf I wanted to get Senator Manchin, I\u2019d just go out and slam him, like he did me, put national TV ads on,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m trying to win an election.\u201d Through a spokesman, Mr. Manchin declined to be interviewed. \u201cOut of respect for our coal miners and their families who are still grieving the loss of their loved ones, I will not comment on Don Blankenship,\u2019\u2019 he said in a statement. \u201cWest Virginians know the facts, and the jury has spoken.\u201d Mr. Blankenship was convicted of a misdemeanor count of conspiracy in 2015 after  the jury heard  that federal safety inspectors had written hundreds of safety violations for the Upper Big Branch mine, and former miners described unsafe conditions there. On the campaign trail, Mr. Blankenship charges that \u201cthe Obama government blew up the Upper Big Branch mine.\u201d He maintains that the explosion happened because federal inspectors had ordered the company to install an ineffective ventilation system. None of the  several  investigations  conducted by state, federal and independent authorities support Mr. Blankenship\u2019s theory on the mine disaster. Instead,  investigators found  that mine management failed to prevent a combustible buildup of coal dust, which was ignited by faulty machinery to create a fireball. After completing his prison time at the Taft Correctional Institution in California, Mr. Blankenship declared  in court papers  that his primary residence was in Las Vegas. The car that brought him to a recent appearance in Parkersburg, W.Va., was a luxury BMW sedan with Tennessee plates. To many relatives of the miners who were killed, his re-emergence in coal country is a source of bitter pain. Gary and Patty Quarles, who are raising a grandson after their son, Gary Wayne Quarles, was killed at Upper Big Branch, described their anguish at watching Mr. Blankenship\u2019s TV ads, titled \u201cFor the Sake of Coal Miners.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re sitting here in our living room with our grandson, and there he sets up on TV \u2014 that\u2019s sickening,\u201d said Mr. Quarles, who also worked in Massey Energy coal mines. \u201cDon can say what he wants to about safety and doing all this and that for miners \u2014 there was no safety in Massey coal. None whatever.\u201d \u201cAll they know is to lie, cheat and outlaw,\u201d he added. At a barbershop on Main Street in Logan, the county seat, customers with ties to mining tended to react negatively to Mr. Blankenship\u2019s candidacy, while the barber, Chad Browning, was studiedly neutral. \u201cCoal is king in this county,\u201d said Mr. Browning, 45. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else here.\u201d In his shop in the former bus station, a haircut is $10 and a poster for a Kiwanis pancake breakfast is taped to the mirror. The street outside is a shadowy canyon of tired brick buildings, with a tattoo parlor nearby and a pawnshop offering \u201cLoans, Guns, Ammo.\u201d Only one UPS truck stops to make deliveries on Main Street these days, Mr. Browning said, where once there were three. The UPS driver, Mike Workman, 46, the son of a coal miner, watched Mr. Browning apply hot lather to a customer and shave his neck with a straight razor. Mr. Workman lamented how the conflict over coal, between protecting jobs and protecting the environment, had become so bitter. \u201cIt\u2019s a political war, but to us it\u2019s not a political war \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to make a living,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s nobody in West Virginia that wants to see the streams tainted. I\u2019m a fisherman and a hunter. We love this area. This is where our kids play. We drink the water here.\u201d He said he could not vote for Mr. Blankenship. \u201cI\u2019ve had family in the mining industry; they know that he puts production above safety,\u201d he said. In the barber\u2019s chair, Bob Lucas, 52, who works in a coal processing plant, said he could not support Mr. Blankenship, either. Mr. Lucas was once an electrician at a Massey-owned mine, where he said he was asked to take shortcuts that would compromise safety. Rather than do that, he said, he quit the job. Mr. Lucas said the mine\u2019s managers lived in fear of a visit from Mr. Blankenship, who would descend on the site by helicopter. \u201cWhen Don flew in, they were terrified,\u201d he said.","articles_date":"26 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/02\/26\/us\/don-blankenship-west-virginia-senate.html","articles_title":"Coal Country Divides Over an Unrepentant Boss\u2019s Senate Bid","candidate_fk":5,"first_name":"Patrick","id":45,"issue":6,"last_name":"Morrisey","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Suddenly, the figure at the center of the 2016 presidential race isn't even running for office.   James Comey's revelation Friday that the bureau is reviewing newly discovered emails that might be linked to Hillary Clinton's private server made the FBI director's unusual actions the focus on Sunday news programs and on the campaign trail.  The  new emails were found weeks ago , law enforcement officials told CNN Sunday. But the FBI didn't disclose them until Friday, raising questions about why the information was kept under wraps and then released just days before the election. Clinton's allies lambasted Comey -- characterizing him as inappropriately acting outside Justice Department protocol and against the wishes of his superiors -- as they sought to shame him into revealing more details about what, exactly, the FBI has discovered.  \"He might have taken the first step of actually having looked at them (the emails) before he did this in the middle of a presidential campaign, so close to the voting,\" Clinton campaign chairman  John Podesta told CNN's Jake Tapper  on \"State of the Union.\"  Donald Trump and his surrogates, meanwhile, largely dropped their long-standing attacks on the FBI director over his July announcement that he wasn't recommending criminal charges against Clinton -- which Comey defended in congressional hearings.  \"I guess he was trying to clear his own conscience,\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on \"State of the Union.\"  Clinton herself was mum on the issue on the campaign trail on Sunday in Fort Lauderdale, while Trump continued to pound away on the email issue for a third straight day during an appearance in Las Vegas.  The intense focus on the FBI director just nine days from the November 8 election comes with Clinton's campaign hoping his letter to Congress won't be Comey's last word on the topic.  The emails were discovered in the FBI's investigation into Anthony Weiner, the former New York congressman who is alleged to have exchanged lewd messages with a 15-year-old girl. The FBI discovered the emails on a computer shared by Weiner and his now-estranged wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.  The hubris of the 2016 candidates Democrats didn't try to hide their frustration with Comey over his revelation that emails had been found -- with no further details on whether Clinton is connected or what the emails contain.  In an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine called Comey's Friday letter \"extremely puzzling\" and an \"unprecedented move ... because it happens close to an election, which is in violation of normal Justice Department protocol. And it involves talking about an ongoing investigation, which also violates the protocol.\" \"And as far as we know now, Director Comey knows nothing about the content of these emails. We don't know whether they're to or from Hillary at all,\" Kaine said. He called on the FBI to make an expedited effort to review the new emails. \"If he (Comey) hasn't seen the emails, I mean they need to make that completely plain -- then they should work to see the emails and release the circumstances of those once they have done that analysis,\" he said. Kaine also rejected arguments that Comey had little option -- and would have faced withering criticism had he waited until after the election of a new president to disclose the review. \"The issue for the FBI director is not whether somebody would criticize him. The issue for the FBI director is, is he following established protocols for a law enforcement investigation?\" Kaine said. \"You know, criticism comes with the territory, but you can't tack and move one direction or the next to avoid criticism,\" he said. \"Following established protocols and rules is what you would expect from a chief law enforcement official.\" And early Sunday evening Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid sent a scorching letter to Comey, alleging political interference in the presidential campaign. The Nevada Democrat invoked the Hatch Act, \"I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act,\"  which bars government officials from using their position to influence an election. Reid said \"it has become clear you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors and the Russian government...and yet you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.\" He added: \"By contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible.\" \"Moreover, in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own Department,\" he added. \"The clear double-standard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group,\" he later said in the letter. The FBI had no immediate response to Reid's letter. Trump's supporters, seizing on a political gift that came just as the race appeared to be slipping out of the Republican nominee's reach, heaped praise on Comey -- saying he'd righted a wrong just in time.  Obama to Clinton volunteers: Ignore 'noise and distractions' \"I think what you see here is an example of real leadership,\" Mike Pence, the GOP vice presidential nominee, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" He cast it as correcting the FBI's July decision not to recommend charges against Clinton. \"It was just incomprehensible this summer, when the director of the FBI came out and he literally indicted Hillary Clinton in the press and then said we're not recommending that she be indicted,\" Pence said. Comey's actions are drawing intense scrutiny beyond the campaign trail. He faces criticism within the law enforcement community -- and the Justice Department.  Attorney General Loretta Lynch and her deputy, Sally Yates, disagreed with Comey outlining how the FBI was dealing the review of emails, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion. Comey notified Congress anyway, going against what an agency official said was longstanding Justice Department and FBI practice to not comment publicly about politically sensitive investigations within 60 days of an election.  Comey acknowledged a balance he was trying to strike in a letter to bureau employees. \"We don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,\" Comey wrote. \"I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record. \"At the same time, however, given that we don't know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don't want to create a misleading impression. In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it,\" he continued. The question now is whether Comey will once again emerge with new details -- particularly as Democrats press him to reveal Clinton's role in the new email discovery.  \"If he doesn't come out and get all the information on the table, he's going to let anyone, any conspiracy theory, take the day,\" said Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"  CNN's Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","articles_date":"30 10 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/10\/30\/politics\/comey-spotlight-clinton-trump\/index.html","articles_title":"Comey in harsh spotlight of 2016 campaign","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":46,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Douglas Heye is a CNN political commentator and former deputy chief of staff to then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.  (CNN) The  announcement  that City of New Orleans would remove four monuments to the Confederate era was sure to cause controversy and stoke racial tensions in the city. Removing Confederate monuments can be a delicate issue in the South. But the monument in question isn't your garden variety statue honoring a general who was brave in battle.  The Liberty Place Monument  commemorates  an 1874 uprising by the Crescent City White League, described as a \"paramilitary organization of the Democratic Party, made up largely of Confederate veterans.\" In 1932, an inscription was added, noting \"The national election November 1876 recognized white supremacy in the South and gave us our state.\" As the first monument was slated for removal, Corey Stewart, a Republican candidate for Governor of Virginia  took to Twitter , declaring \"Nothing is worse than a Yankee telling a Southerner that his monuments don't matter.\" As  his Tweet-storm continued , he used the hashtag #HistoricalVandalism and compared the removal of the monuments to actions taken by ISIS. Why in the world would a gubernatorial candidate in Virginia involve himself in a controversy over an obelisk several hundred miles away, one that New Orleans City Council  in 1993 declared a public nuisance? The answer, of course, is politics -- and the misguided hope that by highlighting this issue, Stewart can appeal to older white Republicans voters in the state who remember previous  fights over the erection of an Arthur Ashe statue  on Richmond's Monument Avenue, long home to statues honoring Confederate icons such as Jefferson Davis, Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson and Robert E. Lee. And possibly raise funds from the alt-right.  The explicit white supremacist message attached to the New Orleans monument Stewart is defending makes the oft-used claim by defenders of the Confederacy of \"heritage, not hate\" tough to swallow here, and whatever role it might play in a Virginia Gubernatorial primary, is yet another example of why Virginia's Republicans continually  fail to attract minority voters . That Stewart's outburst comes just days after a Republican state senator in Florida  resigned after using the \"N-word\"  in front of colleagues only compounds and highlights the national scope of the problem. Of course, for many Republicans, there is no problem. Trump's victory and GOP control of government has given little reason for introspection on the challenges the party still faces. For them, Trump's victory shows it is Democrats, not Republicans, who face demographic challenges. For those Republicans essentially uninterested in appealing to minority voters, or who are already convinced such an effort will fail, nothing need change. Politically, that may work in the short term, but long-term, that approach spells doom. The health of a political party is based on growth and appealing to new and different voters. Having maximized support from white working-class voters last year, the GOP must make serious, sustained efforts to appeal to minority voters who for too long have only heard a Republican message that -- whether on immigration, monuments or coarse and tasteless jokes about the Obamas -- consisted of \"We don't like you,\" which ultimately eclipses efforts on issues like school choice, job and wage growth or criminal justice reform. By contrast with Stewart, in  removing the Confederate flag  from the State Capitol in 2015, and doing so by bringing together people of different backgrounds and ideologies, former South Carolina Governor -- now UN Ambassador -- Nikki Haley demonstrated a path forward for how Republicans can get things right on thorny, historical issues of race. Her example shows that doing the right thing has political benefits. But Republicans can only move forward if they choose to do so. The challenge is how to keep those who are stuck in the past from holding back those who want to look toward the future.

Va., sent a letter to Miller asking him to hold hearings to \"closely examine this disaster, to understand what caused the massive explosion, and to discern what further action might be taken to prevent it from ever happening again.\" It was not clear when the hearings will be held.

But  after the shooting in Las Vegas,  Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, was stunned by the audio he was hearing, the sounds of a gun popping at a concert in Las Vegas at a frequency he was almost sure wasn't just coming from a semi-automatic weapon. \"I think all of us assumed that when we heard the audio that it was a fully automatic weapon. ... How in the world would the shooter get that?\" Flake asked. Flake called a friend who collected guns and asked him: What was he hearing? \"He heard the audio and he thought 'that wasn't fully automatic. Fully automatic is about 800 rounds, and that sounded like about 500.' ... He started telling me about, not just the bump stocks, about a crank and other methods to mechanically increase the rate of fire,\" Flake said. Sen. John Cornyn, the majority whip who called for hearings on the bump stocks this week, also said it was the video footage that got him thinking about the gun accessory. RELATED: Republican-led bill on bump stocks expected to be introduced Thursday in House \"You know, I'd heard about them before, but I'd never actually seen one, and I certainly had never seen a video of someone using them to spray a concert audience of 22,000 people with gunshots,\" Cornyn said. \"I just had no idea that that was possible.\" Across Capitol Hill, the contours of America's gun debate are well established. In the wake of mass shootings, Republicans retreat to their positions and Democrats to theirs. But bump stocks -- devices that weren't part of the American lexicon before Monday -- have shed new light on an old debate. \"I think we ought to have hearings on it, look at it, and I think we shouldn't be marketing or allowed to market things that make our guns illegal like they do,\" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican. It wasn't just Republicans learning about the device this week. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat who was governor during the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007, said that it was his son, a member of the Marine Corps, who got him up to speed on the accessories that convert semi-automatic weapons to firing more like an automatic one. \"Within five hours of the shooting, he had written me a note sort of walking me through how you do it and how simple it is,\" Kaine said. What makes the bump stock debate different, members say, is the fact that automatic weapons -- guns that unleash bullets in rapid succession with just a single pull of the trigger -- are already highly restricted in the US. Therefore, members argue, it's hard not to take a look at a device that would transition a legal weapon into one that fires at a rate similar to the tightly restricted ones. House Speaker Paul Ryan -- a hunter -- said Thursday on MSNBC that he wanted to look more into bump stocks given the laws that are already on the books. \"I didn't even know what they were until this week, and I'm an avid sportsman,\" Ryan said. \"So, I think we're quickly coming up to speed with what this is. Fully automatic weapons have been banned for a long time. Apparently this allows you to take a semi-automatic, turn it into a fully automatic. So clearly that's something we need to look into.\" In the House, Rep. Carlos Curbelo,  has taken the lead on introducing legislation  to ban the sale of  bump stocks. The Florida Republican told reporters Thursday that so far many Republican members have reached out to him interested in signing onto his bill. \"I think we are on the verge of a breakthrough when it comes to sensible gun policy,\" Curbelo told reporters Thursday, saying his office has been \"flooded\" with calls from other lawmakers asking about the bill. It's still early in the debate over bump stocks. Even Cornyn, the Republican from Texas calling for a hearing, hasn't said he wants to ban bump stocks with legislation. The Senate's Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has said he'd need a full investigation into what happened in Las Vegas before holding any hearing. And while the NRA signaled an openness to some changes on bump stock regulations, the group's statement called on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to make the changes, not Congress. In the meantime, many GOP senators remain cautious about throwing their support behind regulating an accessory they are just learning about. \"I am going to get someone to present to me in my office what a bump stock device is. I apologize but I do not know,\" Corker said earlier this week. \"We have a person in our office who sits down and walks me through all these technical issues and shows me photographs and tells me how that affects law. So I don't have a response today.\" CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Sunlen, Serfaty, Phil Mattingly, Ashley Killough and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","articles_date":"5 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/05\/politics\/bump-stock-congress-gun-control\/index.html","articles_title":"Congress learns what a bump stock is","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":49,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Early Friday morning, the Senate passed  a $1.3 trillion spending package  that will increase funding for the military and domestic spending and will keep the government funded through the end of September, sending the legislation to the President for his signature house ahead of a midnight deadline. The Senate passed the bill after a whirlwind day where  at least two Republican senators  held up the legislative process and made it appear unclear whether the bill could pass ahead of the deadline. The bill passed 65-32, averting a potential government shutdown and funding the government through September 30. The House passed the legislation earlier Thursday, voting 256-167 with Democrats and Republicans coming together to pass it less than 24 hours after the 2,300-page bill was made public. President Donald Trump signed the bill later Friday after he  threatened to veto  it earlier over a lack of an immigration solution, though members of his administration have said as recently as Thursday that the President will sign the measure. The President criticized the bill  and warned Congress  \"I will never sign another bill like this again.\" The Senate needed unanimous consent -- meaning all members have to agree -- to bring the bill up for a timely vote. If one member objected, it could have forced the government into a brief shutdown, which is why many congressional observers were watching Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul,  who forced a brief shutdown last month  using a similar procedural maneuver. On Thursday, Paul spent hours criticizing the bill and the process by which the legislation is made public and passed, and  appeared to live-tweeting  as he scanned the measure. \"Page 430 of 'crumni-bus: Good news. The government is going to \"earn\" $350 million by selling oil from Strategic Petroleum Reserve,\" he  tweeted . \"Bad news is the $ won't go to reduce the $21 trillion debt. The $ will be instead be spent elsewhere by the Federal government.\" Earlier Thursday, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when the Senate would vote -- he smiled and said in front of reporters, \"whenever Sen. Paul decides we can.\" But Paul said Thursday night that Senate leadership should reach out to him if they want to speed the process along. \"It's just the way the rules are,\" he told CNN's Phil Mattingly. \"I mean, they will eventually beat me. Time will run out and they will eventually win but if they'd like to do it in a more expeditious fashion, all they've got to do it call me.\" Paul said he was open to \"compromise\" but did specify what that would entail, but shortly after he spoke with CNN, Paul and McConnell spoke, a Paul spokesman said.  Paul not the only issue While senators waited to see if there would be a vote Thursday night, several Republicans -- including Ted Cruz of Texas and Joni Ernst of Iowa -- came out against the bill, though there's no indication that any of those senators would delay the timing on the vote. Another notable holdout Thursday night was Idaho Republican Sen. Jim Risch. While Paul's tirade against leadership was more public, behind the scenes aides were scrambling to satisfy Risch, who was holding up the spending bill because a provision renamed the White Clouds Wilderness preserve in Idaho to the \"Cecil D. Andrus-White Clouds Wilderness\" preserve, after the former Democratic Idaho governor.  First approached by what one source described as an \"angry\" Risch Thursday morning, Senate staff spent an entire day trying to figure out not just how to satisfy Risch's concerns -- which were made clear to be serious from an early stage -- but also exactly why they existed. Aides soon realized stemmed back to a home-state political rivalry with Andrus, the sources said. There were meetings with staff and the senator in the cloakroom, just off the Senate floor. That led to a meeting in Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office, and finally, a phone call to House Speaker Paul Ryan to lay out exactly how to get the name changed or removed. The potential solution, which was quietly and quickly approved on the Senate floor by unanimous consent, was in the form of an enrollment correction to the omnibus, which would have stripped the new name of the reserve from the bill. At one point, Risch appeared on the floor with McConnell and Risch was clearly agitated. From the gallery, he could be overheard telling McConnell, \"I'm not going to consent to do anything.\" But in the end, after a full day of work that included not just Senate and House staff, but also White House involvement, Risch agreed to allow the vote to move forward. As to the name of the preserve? That will stay. House leaders declined to give Risch a commitment that they will take up the corrections measure to strip the language, and aides say they will not.  Risch declined to comment when asked about the situation by reporters. He voted against the final bill. What's in the plan and who supports it The massive spending package marks the end of a months-long funding stalemate in which lawmakers were forced to pass one short-term spending bill after another to stave off a shutdown. The package includes more than just money to fight the opioid epidemic, pay the military and fund more than $21 billion in infrastructure projects. It also includes policy changes like one that would incentivize states to enter more records into the country's gun background check system and another that would cut off aide to the Palestinian Authority until Palestinians cease making payments to the families of terrorists. Trump will sign the omnibus bill if it reaches his desk, Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters on Thursday. Mulvaney admitted that the bill wasn't perfect and wasn't exactly what the White House wanted, but that -- on the whole -- the bill \"funds (Trump's) priorities.\" While the bill attracted broad bipartisan support in the House, it didn't win over everyone. On the right, lawmakers blasted the bill as a prime example of Washington's bloated spending. \"If the bill passed the way it is, I would -- I hope the White House does -- does veto it. I don't know if they will. It's been a long process so they may not, but I think it's not good for the American taxpayer, and it's not consistent with -- in any way close to consistent with what we said we would do when they elected us in 2016,\" said Jim Jordan, a member of the House Freedom Caucus. On the left, some Democrats rejected the proposal because it didn't include permanent protectees under for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \"Anyone who votes for the omnibus is voting for the deportation of Dreamers and other immigrants. You will be voting to take money from law-abiding taxpayers -- some of whom are immigrants -- and give that money to privately-run prisons that will make a profit off of each and every human being our government hands over to them for detention and then deportation,\" Luis Gutierrez, a Democrat from Illinois, said in a statement. Spending bill watch: House votes Thursday, leaders optimistic The internal GOP backlash to the amount of spending and the process of rushing the measure through just 16 hours after it was released was on full display on the House floor on Thursday. Twenty-five House Republicans broke with their leadership and opposed the usually party line procedural vote bringing up the legislation. But the measure narrowly passed 211-207.

The views expressed in this commentary are hers.  (CNN) The much-anticipated showdown between Silicon Valley and Washington, DC, is center stage this week, as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before House and Senate panels about the mishandling of Facebook data.  Senator John Thune  opened  Tuesday's Senate hearing by urging Zuckerberg to ensure his dream \"doesn't become a privacy nightmare\" for millions of Americans.  I believe Zuckerberg is capable of addressing Thune's concern, and without assistance from the federal government.  Facebook is already taking steps to address concerns over privacy, safety and the sanctity of democracy. Because the social media giant is imposing new standards of transparency and accountability to address the privacy breach, Congress should hold off on imposing regulations.   In other words, Facebook can self-regulate -- and we should give it a chance to put its new policies into practice. While hearings are underway on the Hill, the social media giant has begun the unenviable task of notifying the  87 million users  whose personal data was improperly obtained by political research firm Cambridge Analytica.   And I, for one, am interested in seeing Facebook address this wrong, given my own experience with Cambridge Analytica. While serving as Communications Director on the 2016 Ted Cruz for President campaign, we contracted with Cambridge Analytica. It promised to deliver a data service enhanced by psychological voter profiles that could predict the personality and possible political leanings of those they target. Cambridge Analytica claimed to have the \"secret sauce\" for the optimum voter files.   That turned out not to be the case, and ultimately we used voter files from the Republican National Committee and data modeling firm i360. The foundation for all of our data and analytics was created by the Cruz Director of Analytics, Chris Wilson. Cambridge Analytica simply operated as data scientists on Wilson's team. That  didn't stop  the firm from taking credit for several Cruz primary wins and the Trump victory.  But the actions of Cambridge Analytica are just one piece of the Facebook puzzle that will be taken apart during the congressional hearings.  Senator Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut,  sees  the Zuckerberg testimony as a moment of reckoning, calling it \"high noon for Facebook and the tech industry.\"   However, the question is not what Zuckerberg is going to do to survive the anticipated political grandstanding by members of Congress, but what Facebook is going to do to protect privacy and retain the trust of its 2 billion users.   To address the data breach, Facebook has  taken steps  to safeguard user privacy by putting stronger protections in place -- beginning with updating the site's privacy settings. In addition, they plan to investigate all apps with access to large amounts of information, restrict access to user data and ensure users are aware of who has access to their personal data. As for the issue of political propaganda, Russian government trolls used Facebook to spread misinformation during the 2016 election. They used fake accounts and pages to run ads and \"game the system,\"  according  to Zuckerberg.  Facebook admits that it was slow to pick up on foreign interference in the 2016 US elections. But it's also beginning to take action. Facebook  announced last week  that it will require buyers of political ads to verify their identity and location, and those who are unable to do so will be prohibited from running political ads on the platform. And it  has committed  to increased transparency and accountability across electoral and issue ads and pages. Ideally, the joint hearings will conclude with Facebook having clearly articulated these practical solutions to enhancing privacy safeguards and preventing bad actors from undermining our democracy.  If Facebook succeeds in doing so, it will have shown a good faith effort to identify the cause of recent problems -- and, more importantly, its ability to adequately address them without government assistance.

The event is expected to the biggest yet in a string of rallies and protests nationwide since a gunman  killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida,  last month. The shooting sparked an unprecedented wave of student-led activism calling for more gun control and school safety measures.   Saturday's march, which starts at noon, come a day after Congress passed  a massive spending bill  that included a large measure to increase security at schools, as well as legislation that would better  enforce reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System . The bill also aims to clarify that the Centers for Disease Control  can conduct research on gun violence . Still, a number of other gun-related bills have been introduced and many Democrats, along with some Republicans, are working to keep gun violence a top priority in Congress.   \"There's a long way to go and that's what these students are here for,\" Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said Friday at a news conference with other lawmakers and activists. Nelson worked with Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, also of Florida, to introduce legislation that would  encourage states to adopt \"red flag\" laws , which would give authorities power to seize guns from those who pose a threat to themselves or others. Rubio, who's been highly active in the gun debate since the Florida shooting, said Thursday at a news conference that his role is to legislate, rather than demonstrate. RELATED: 6 things Marco Rubio said at the CNN town hall that made news in the US gun debate \"I am a legislator,\" Rubio said. \"I pass public policy. Instead of marching, I should be acting, I should be passing laws,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean you can't also do a march. I know some legislators will do that. But that's what I've been focused on. That's what I'll continue to focus on. That's why we are here, to announce this, because when we get back this is going to be the one thing that I think we can do next.\" Republicans are largely keeping their distance from the rallies, though some are contributing in other ways. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who's in an extremely competitive district in Florida and who introduced a bill this week to raise the age requirement for rifles and shotguns, announced he's donating $2,500 to help pay for transportation for Parkland students to the march in Washington.   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will also remain in Washington for the event Saturday, as well as dozens of other House Democrats, and several more will take part in events in their districts, according to her office. Pelosi encouraged members to wear orange at the rally \u2014 a color affiliated with gun violence activism \u2014 and change their social media profile photos to show the text #NeverAgain and #EndViolence. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer will be in New Jersey for previously scheduled travel but his office said he plans to attend two sister events for \"March for Our Lives\" on Saturday while he's there. Meanwhile, close to a dozen Senate Democrats say they plan to be at the march in Washington or meet with students around the march. They include Nelson of Florida, Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Sens. Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Sen.

Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a contractor with Pluribus International Corporation in Georgia, is  accused of  \"removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet,\" according to a federal complaint. CNN is told by sources that the document Winner allegedly leaked is the same one used as the basis for the  article published  Monday by The Intercept, detailing a classified National Security Agency memo. The NSA report, dated May 5, provides details of a 2016 Russian military intelligence cyberattack on a US voting software supplier, though there is no evidence that any votes were affected by the hack. A US official confirmed to CNN that The Intercept's document is a genuine, classified NSA document.  US intelligence officials tell CNN that the information has not changed the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, which found: \"Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards. DHS assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying.\"  Prosecutors say when confronted with the allegations, Winner admitted to intentionally leaking the classified document -- and she was arrested June 3 in Augusta, Georgia. An internal audit revealed Winner was one of six people who printed the document, but the only one who had email contact with the news outlet, according to the complaint. It further states that the intelligence agency was subsequently contacted by the news outlet on May 30 regarding an upcoming story, saying it was in possession of what appeared to be a classified document. The Intercept's director of communications Vivian Siu told CNN the document was provided anonymously. \"As we reported in the story, the NSA document was provided to us anonymously. The Intercept has no knowledge of the identity of the source,\" Siu said. \"Releasing classified material without authorization threatens our nation's security and undermines public faith in government. People who are trusted with classified information and pledge to protect it must be held accountable when they violate that obligation,\" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a statement Monday.  Winner faces up to 10 years in prison for leaking classified information. Winner's court-appointed attorney, Titus Nichols, said a detention hearing will take place on Thursday in Augusta, where the judge will determine whether to release her on bond. Winner did not enter a plea in her initial appearance Monday. Last month Attorney General Jeff Sessions slammed leaks in the wake of the Manchester attacks, saying: \"We have already initiated appropriate steps to address these rampant leaks that undermine our national security.\" Winner's mother said that her daughter is \"touch and go\" in an interview with CNN on Monday. \"I think she's trying to be brave for me,\" Billie Winner said. \"I don't think she's seeing a light at the end of the tunnel.\" She also said her daughter wasn't especially political and had not ever praised past leakers like Edward Snowden, to her knowledge. \"She's never ever given me any kind of indication that she was in favor of that at all,\" her mother said. \"I don't know how to explain it.\" Nichols told CNN that Winner spent six years in the military, speaks Farsi and Pashtun, and has been with her current company since 2017. He added that he has not received any evidence from the government about the arrest warrant and case files, and hasn't seen evidence of a relationship between his client and the reporter. \"She's just been caught in the middle of something bigger than her,\" Nichols said. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the former Democratic vice presidential candidate, said on CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" that people who leak classified information should face the full force of the law, but added that Americans need to know much more about alleged Russian attempts to influence the election. \"Somebody who leaks documents against laws has got to suffer the consequences\" Kaine said. \"But the American public is also entitled to know the degree to which Russia invaded the election to take the election away from American voters.\" Kaine noted he knew of no evidence that showed Russia affected machine voting totals and said he was referring to intelligence assessments that Russia had acted to influence the election. In October 2016,  CNN reported  that federal investigators believe Russian hackers were behind cyberattacks on a contractor for Florida's election system that may have exposed the personal data of Florida voters, according to US officials briefed on the probe. The hack of the Florida contractor came on the heels of hacks in Illinois, in which personal data of tens of thousands of voters may have been stolen, and one in Arizona, in which investigators believe the data of voters was likely exposed. The October information appears to be part of what is contained in the new NSA document, but the document contains additional details.    Most significantly, as CNN reported at the time, and The Intercept also reports Monday based on the this document, that there is still no evidence any votes were affected by Russian hacking. In a  tweet Monday , WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange called on the public to support Winner, adding that the young woman is \"accused of courage in trying to help us know.\" CNN's David Shortell and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","articles_date":"6 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/05\/politics\/federal-contractor-leak-prosecution\/index.html","articles_title":"Contractor charged with leaking classified NSA info on Russian hacking","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":54,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Lawyers for former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship say he can withhold personal financial information under a constitutional right to remain silent during sentencing.

(END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: \u00a0I still offer that beer, and in the spirit of spreading the wealth, Mr. President, I'll pay for it -- in celebration. \u00a0Your eight years are over. \u00a0Now, no one in the mainstream media came to my defense after the president made those remarks and a lot more, not that I would ever need or want them to defend me. \u00a0If anything, they were probably cheering him on for what he did, attacking me and FOX News and talk radio and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin. So here is what it all comes down to. \u00a0The media wants to be fair in their coverage of President-elect Trump, then fine. \u00a0But if they're not, well, they can expect plenty more of what the president-elect gave them earlier this week. Joining us now, syndicated columnist, host of the series \"Michelle Malkin Investigates\" on CRTV.com, Michelle Malkin. I watch the double standard. \u00a0Part of me just wants to laugh, but then a part of me realizes for the rest of the country, this is -- journalism's dead. \u00a0We have an informational crisis. \u00a0What's your reaction? MICHELLE MALKIN, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST: \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0And of course, you seem to have occupied rent-free space in President Obama's head for many years now, Sean! (LAUGHTER) MALKIN: \u00a0I love it! HANNITY: \u00a0I think it's, like, 15 times he mentioned me, something like that, yes. MALKIN: \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Well, I think that you deserve a Golden Globe for all of these incredible clip reels that you put together. \u00a0I think it's a public service. These people need to have it in their faces and be reminded of their behavior and their media malpractice over the last eight years! \u00a0Good riddance to eight years of Obama's drool bucket media, these fan girls and fan boys who literally ogled not just President Obama, but when he was a candidate, and as you pointed out in highlighting with Jimmy Fallon, they're fawning over at Michelle Obama! And of course, those of us, you and I, Sean, and so many other stalwart critics and opponents and questioners and dissidents in conservative media were attacked for doing what those people in the mainstream media should have been doing. \u00a0Do your job! \u00a0Subject these political candidates to the same amount of scrutiny that you are now trying to compensate for with the incoming Trump administration! HANNITY: \u00a0But should the... MALKIN: \u00a0Only after -- only after Obama had done so much damage, Sean, do these people finally admit that yes, yes, we should have asked more questions. \u00a0There's a very famous viral clip of Tom Brokaw and Charlie Rose on PBS, which we pay for, in which they cackle that they didn't vet Obama properly enough. \u00a0There are admissions from The New York Times that they allowed the Obama administration to, quote, \"let the Obama administration rubber stamp and oversee the statements that were printed in The New York Times.\" \u00a0It's shameful! There is David Brooks, who admitted that, yes, he knew that Obama was lying to him about the stimulus and he didn't say nothing about it until two years later! \u00a0Now these people realize... HANNITY: \u00a0Well, let me ask a final question... MALKIN: \u00a0... that there should a proper watchdog role for the press? Please! HANNITY: \u00a0Isn't there a lesson here in what we saw happen this week, the hyperventilating, the breathlessness, the, Wow, we got him. \u00a0They thought they had him this week, that the Trump campaign should understand that they don't like him, they'll never like him, and their goal -- and tell me if I'm bordering on paranoia -- they want to destroy him and they're waiting for the moment to jump. \u00a0Whether it's small and insignificant, it doesn't matter. \u00a0They will turn something into something bigger than it really is. MALKIN: \u00a0Yes, it's going to be a long four years, Sean, but I think that over the course of the campaign -- and this goes for all of the people on the right -- you know, whatever they thought about any particular policy position or personnel choice that Trump had made -- and certainly, I have been vocal about when I liked or didn't like certain things he said or certain choices he made -- and the difference, of course, is that over the course of the next four years, Sean, I know that you, just as we did during the Bush administration, will be very vocal when we're happy and we'll be very vocal when we're not. HANNITY: \u00a0I'm already mad at Congress. MALKIN: \u00a0And the same thing could not -- right? \u00a0And the same thing could not be said... (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: \u00a0... $9.7 trillion debt increase over 10 years? \u00a0What -- I thought they were the part of limited government, balanced budgets! MALKIN: \u00a0That's right. \u00a0And they -- you know what? \u00a0The Republican Party and the establishment have squandered the opportunities they've had before, when they had control of two or three branches of government, and we will be on them like white on rice. \u00a0And I'm sure that there are leftist socialists who are going to say that I just committed a micro-aggression right there. HANNITY: \u00a0Yes! MALKIN: \u00a0But we live in a different era now. \u00a0And thank God for that. HANNITY: \u00a0All right, Michelle Malkin, good to see you. \u00a0Congrats on the TV series. And coming up -- one week from today, the long nightmare that is Barack Obama -- it's over. \u00a0It's done. \u00a0Donald Trump will be your president. Up next, we'll speak with Kellyanne Conway. And then later tonight... (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN FALLON, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN: \u00a0Donald Trump is someone who's very insecure in his victory, and I understand why. \u00a0Every day, there are new developments, new shoes dropping, so to speak, that call into question the legitimacy of his win. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: \u00a0Hillary Clinton's campaign spokesperson questioning the legitimacy of Donald Trump's presidency. \u00a0Why are so many Democrats determined to try and undermine the president-elect before he even takes office? \u00a0I'll ask Democratic senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. That and more on this busy Friday news night straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (NEWSBREAK) HANNITY: \u00a0Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" \u00a0So just in one week, one week from today, seven days, President-elect Trump will be sworn in to be the 45th president of the United States. \u00a0And for the first time in 10 years, Republicans will control the House, the Senate and the White House. Joining us now, counselor to the president-elect Kellyanne Conway -- you know, when I go out and meet people, the person they ask about besides President-elect Trump the most is you! \u00a0Everyone wants to know, What's Kellyanne like? \u00a0And I'm, like -- is she as nice as she seems? \u00a0I said nicer. \u00a0So... KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP: \u00a0Thank you. HANNITY: \u00a0People are really happy. \u00a0All right... CONWAY: \u00a0Tell them I love them back, and this is a victory and a future shared by all. \u00a0And we're just getting started. HANNITY: \u00a0The only -- the only thing to me that matters is that the agenda gets fulfilled. \u00a0Walk us through these 100 days, what we call the first 100 days of the president-elect, and tell us what we can expect. CONWAY: \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Sean, that is exactly why Donald Trump ran for president. \u00a0I would submit to you it's why he won the presidency because people know that he will make good on these promises, his plan, because if he doesn't, he's just another typical politician promising to do things they don't intend. So he has these very specific plans on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. A poll out just today showed that 65 percent of Americans want the ACA, ObamaCare, repealed in part or in whole. \u00a0It's a very high number. Folks are really frustrated. \u00a0We know that premiums are rising. \u00a0Their (INAUDIBLE) choices are fewer. \u00a0Their access is less. \u00a0And their frustrations are high. So making good on that repealing and replacing ObamaCare is important. The president-elect and of the vice president-elect had meetings on that this week. \u00a0Their legislative team had meetings on that this very week, this week. \u00a0The Senate already took action toward repealing ObamaCare. Now, he -- the president-elect is committed in so doing that those who have coverage will not be without coverage, that we'll get rid of that draconian penalty, the -- basically, that you're forced to buy government-run health care, pay a tax, pay a penalty. There will be health savings accounts for people, and there will be the ability to buy health insurance across state lines, a more patient-centric free market system. Also, he'll start building that wall with the intention of Mexico paying for it either now or later on as compensation. HANNITY: \u00a0So... CONWAY: \u00a0If the Congress can speed up the process by paying for it, terrific. \u00a0You'll also see energy, unleashing energy. \u00a0He'll start to do infrastructure, and he of course will get more serious about defeating radical Islamic terrorism and get very serious about rebuilding our military. HANNITY: \u00a0So vetting refugees, originalist justices, seven brackets to three, 15 percent corporate tax, repatriating multi-national corporations, ObamaCare gone, replaced with what you said, energy independence, that's going to be done. CONWAY: \u00a0Energy independence. HANNITY: \u00a0Education to the states. CONWAY: \u00a0Which is also part of his -- oh, yes, education, too. \u00a0(INAUDIBLE) Betsy DeVos in as education secretary nominee, Sean. \u00a0She is -- she looks at alternatives to conventional schools, schooling systems where charters and school choice and certainly respecting home schoolers. \u00a0At the same time, respecting our back to basics curriculum and letting parents and local governments have more of a say of where children go to school and what is taught there. You mentioned something very important. \u00a0You talked about the extreme vetting and you talked about energy investments. \u00a0These are also very specific solution-centric plans that President-elect Trump ran on. \u00a0I think the fact that he got specific was very important to voters because that's what businessmen do. \u00a0They're accountable for results and deliverables. They can't fudge the numbers. \u00a0They can't just have a commission and kick the can down the road. \u00a0They actually have to produce in a quarterly, monthly, weekly way. If you can tell me right now -- I'll start the jeopardy clock -- what Hillary Clinton's message was in this election, other than Donald Trump bad and... HANNITY: \u00a0I can't tell you what she did... CONWAY: \u00a0... I'm not Donald Trump... HANNITY: \u00a0... in 40 years! CONWAY: \u00a0His message was specific. HANNITY: \u00a0I can't tell you... (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: \u00a0All right, let me ask this last question. \u00a0What you're saying is he's going to keep all these promises, which I think is the key to political success, but I also think it's the change that the country needs. This is not a simple agenda. \u00a0I do believe there'll be resistance along the way, especially with the Supreme Court and building the wall and vetting refuges and some of these other issues. What will he be able to do in the first hours as president to undo a lot of the damage Obama's done with executive orders? CONWAY: \u00a0So on Monday, January 3rd (sic), President Donald J. Trump can sit down and basically rescind these executive orders, those that Obama put in very late in the game, with respect to the environment, mining -- there are other regulations that we hear from business owners and employers constantly, Sean, that it's really the regulatory system that has a chokehold on them, that they can't retain talent and they can't hire American workers. \u00a0They can't keep their factories here. \u00a0They can't expand here. And you see the Trump effect already now during the transition. \u00a0And the Trump effect happened again today here in Trump Tower, where the CEO of Lockheed Martin came, and you know, then she went and announced that they will, in fact, reduce the price of the F-35. HANNITY: \u00a0I saw that, yes. CONWAY: \u00a0The Trump effect has been to keep jobs here. \u00a0Factories are staying here. \u00a0And that when he sits down, he can actually rescind a number of these executive orders that have really hurt people. I remember Barack Obama as president has been very fond of the executive order. \u00a0And it's just the stroke of a pen, really, that allows President Trump to go more in line with what Americans expect. \u00a0Energy is a key one. We hear from people -- we've heard from these conservative right, left and center, I am for all of the above energy. \u00a0What the heck does that mean? Great sound bite. But people say all the time nothing is made in America anymore. \u00a0And I will tell you that we have energy beneath our feet and off our shores. \u00a0And Americans want us to develop that to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and also to stimulate our local economies, crate jobs here at home. \u00a0He's for coal, clean coal. \u00a0He's for shale. \u00a0He's for safe and effective hydraulic fracking, just a very exciting time for us to rely more on Americans and American energy for our economic stimulation and growth. HANNITY: \u00a0Kellyanne, it's a bold agenda. \u00a0If he follows up on all of these items that he talked about in the campaign and you're talking about now that he's been elected, that to me will shift the trajectory of the country. \u00a0I'm going to love watching it. \u00a0It'll be a fight. \u00a0I'll be here fighting on TV and hopefully see you often, and I'll see you down in Washington next week. CONWAY: \u00a0You will see me often. \u00a0And Sean, it really is up to the Republican Congress, as well. HANNITY: \u00a0That's true. CONWAY: \u00a0They're there. \u00a0There's no more excuse of divided government. HANNITY: \u00a0That's correct. \u00a0That's good point. CONWAY: \u00a0And they can do this (INAUDIBLE) governors, state legislatures. This is really the time to harness that and... HANNITY: \u00a0And by the way, we don't need... CONWAY: \u00a0... act more like a business... HANNITY: \u00a0... their $10 trillion debt limit increase, either. \u00a0Thanks a lot. \u00a0They can keep that. \u00a0All right, Kellyanne, good to see you. \u00a0And we'll see you at the inauguration one week from today. Up next, why are Democrats trying to undermine the president-elect before he even takes office? \u00a0I'll ask Democratic senator Joe Manchin. Republicans are already making moves now today and yesterday to repeal ObamaCare. Later, I'll speak with Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, Congressman Louie Gohmert and Congressman Jim Jordan. \u00a0That and more tonight on \"Hannity.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: \u00a0And welcome back to \"Hannity.\" \u00a0So one week from today, Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. \u00a0But many Democrats -- they're still trying desperately to delegitimize Trump's big win in November. \u00a0Mow, this includes Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon. \u00a0He had this to say earlier today. \u00a0Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN FALLON, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN: \u00a0Donald Trump is someone who's very insecure in his victory, and I understand why. \u00a0Every day, there are new developments, new shoes dropping, so to speak. \u00a0They call into question the legitimacy of his win. \u00a0First it was with respect to Russian interference. \u00a0And now with respect to the FBI, we see that Jim Comey's actions are sufficiently questionable that the internal watchdog at DOJ thinks that they merit an independent review. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: \u00a0All right, Fallon is not the only Democrat trying to make excuses for President-elect Trump's win. \u00a0Now, we have a handful of congressional Democrats -- they're now boycotting the inauguration. \u00a0That includes California Congresswoman Barbara Lee. \u00a0She released a statement that reads in part, \"Donald Trump has proven that his administration will normalize the most extreme fringes of the Republican Party. \u00a0On inauguration day, I will not be celebrating. \u00a0I will be organizing and preparing for resistance.\" Also today, in a pre-recorded interview set to air on \"Meet the Press\" this weekend, Congressman John Lewis of Georgia says he doesn't see Donald Trump as a legitimate president. So why are some Democrats trying so hard to smear the presidency of Donald Trump, hasn't even taken office? \u00a0Joining us now, a Democrat, a senator from the great state of West Virginia, Joe Manchin is with us. \u00a0Senator Manchin, thanks for being with us. \u00a0Let me start with what you have... SEN. JOE MANCHIN, D-WEST VIRGINIA: \u00a0Hey, Sean, always good to be with you. HANNITY: \u00a0You've had conversations with Donald Trump, correct? MANCHIN: \u00a0Yes, I have. HANNITY: \u00a0And how have they gone? MANCHIN: \u00a0They've gone great. \u00a0It's refreshing. \u00a0He's reached out, which is what you would think a president-elect coming in, reaching across the aisle, wanting to get things done, seeing if we can find people that'll work together, move things forward, but the country first, put the campaign behind us, put the election behind us, put the Democrats and Republicans behind us and let's bring America to the forefront. I really believe that's what he's trying to do. \u00a0He has reached out to me, and we've had good conversations. HANNITY: \u00a0We still have 95 million Americans out of the labor force, 43 million Americans on food stamps, 50 million in poverty and the lowest home ownership rate of 51 years. \u00a0Those are real problems. I assume especially because you're from West Virginia, on energy, that you want to see these regulations, executive orders go away. \u00a0You want coal mining, you want fracking I assume, you want drilling, you want energy independence. \u00a0Is that a good guess? MANCHIN: \u00a0Yes, and I spoke to President-elect Trump about that. \u00a0You know, we want a balance between the economy and the environment. \u00a0We don't want dirty water. \u00a0We don't want dirty air. \u00a0He doesn't want dirty water. \u00a0He doesn't want dirty air. What we've looked at -- and I told him I think that the things that West Virginians are upset about is that with the laws that we have to protect our environment, they have doubled down and put extra laws. \u00a0Basically, it's a redundancy, a nuisance type of thing that just basically just breaks the will of people who want to be in business. HANNITY: \u00a0Yes. MANCHIN: \u00a0That's not what an energy policy should be. HANNITY: \u00a0Senator, you're an anomaly. \u00a0I just read what Hillary Clinton spokesperson said. \u00a0I just told you what Barbara Lee is doing. \u00a0I've known John Lewis from my time broadcasting in Atlanta. \u00a0I like him a lot, respect him a lot. \u00a0I think what he's doing is harmful. So my question is, what are the things that you see you agree on? \u00a0Would you agree that the promises, for example, of ObamaCare were never kept -- to keep our doctors, plans, and save money? \u00a0Cost per family's gone up  $5,400 in eight years. MANCHIN: \u00a0Well, there is problems, and I've said that, and I'm willing to repair the problems. \u00a0Sean, where I differ -- I've said I'm willing to work and to sit down and work through in a professional manner, in a grown-up manner to basically find the fixes that we need. \u00a0I'm not voting for repealing it until I see a replacement and we can repair it. \u00a0I think that is a reasonable approach. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0As far as I know up until know you are the only Senate Democrat that will vote to confirm Senator Sessions, a colleague, as the new attorney general. \u00a0I see this every four years and it's my biggest complaint. \u00a0Your party, the Democratic Party, every four years without fail, and I've chronicled it on this program, will played the race card. It was played against Senator Sessions in spite of what I think is a pretty incredible record on his part. \u00a0When you see that happen, how do you feel about your party? \u00a0 MANCHIN: \u00a0When I see politics dives to that degree, and you know, and like you say, whether it's on my side of the aisle, the Democratic side, and Sean, let me make it very clear. \u00a0I'm a West Virginia Democrat. \u00a0We are a little bit different than when you look at the national Democrats. \u00a0And I think maybe our Virginia Republicans are too, don't get caught up in all this hullabaloo. \u00a0 But the bottom line is that Jeff Sessions is someone I've known for six years. \u00a0And we've had many conversations on many things, worked on legislation. \u00a0I have never detected one ounce of racism in Jeff or bigotry. I've never seen that. \u00a0And for that to come out of the woodwork, and I said I can only judge a person on how I know him. \u00a0If you want to say you're against Jeff Sessions because he is extremely conservative or too conservative for you, that's fine. \u00a0But don't make something up that maybe is not there. \u00a0I listened and watched his testimony, and the people that came and testified on his behalf, those against him, but those in favor of him. \u00a0I just don't believe that and I think Jeff is a good man. \u00a0I think he will do a good job. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0All right, senator, always good to have you. \u00a0Thank you for being with us. \u00a0 And coming up next on this busy Friday news night here on \"Hannity.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: \u00a0It will be repeal and replace. \u00a0It will be essentially simultaneously. \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: \u00a0You heard him say it, ObamaCare will be repealed and replaced under the new administration. \u00a0Today, the House took a very important step to make all this happen. \u00a0Up next I will speak with Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, Congressman Louie Gohmert, and from the Freedom Caucus Jim Jordan, straight ahead. \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: \u00a0Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us. \u00a0And they will reimburse us for the cost wall. \u00a0That will happen. \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: \u00a0And president-elect Trump says Mexico will in fact pay for the wall. \u00a0Later on tonight I go one-on-one, that's right, a shoot-out with Geraldo Rivera straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: \u00a0Obamacare is a complete and total disaster. \u00a0It'll be repealed and replaced. \u00a0It will be essentially simultaneously. \u00a0It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week but probably the same day, could be the same hour. \u00a0We are going up health care that is far less expensive and far better. \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: \u00a0That was president-elect Donald Trump promising that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced under his administration. \u00a0This morning the president-elect took to Twitter to reinforce that promise. \u00a0He tweeted out, quote, \"The unaffordable care act will soon be history.\" Also today the U.S. House of representatives, the voted 227 to 198 to pass a budget resolution that is a critical step towards repealing ObamaCare. \u00a0 Here now with reaction, Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert. \u00a0Congresswoman, we will start with you. \u00a0A lot of Americans will say why haven't Republicans rallied around one plan by this point? \u00a0I know there are nine out there. \u00a0I know they are similar, but why hasn't the plan been written yet, and Paul Ryan about a week and half go said, well, we will do it sometime this year. He has since adjusted that. \u00a0 REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN, R-TENNESSEE: \u00a0What we have, Sean, you can go back to 2010 to the Blair House health care summit, and we pretty much laid out our plan then. \u00a0Across state line purchase of health care, which is my legislation. \u00a0And yes indeed there are components, there are many different plans. \u00a0What we want to make sure is we pull everything off we can in reconciliation and then follow it with legislation that is going to open up the health insurance marketplace and is going to simplify delivery of health care and do it in a more cost effective manner. \u00a0And I think once we get Secretary Price at HHS and we are able to begin some of the unravel and then the replacement component parts, we want to do it right. \u00a0We're going to do it in a thoughtful manner. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0With the freedom caucus, Jim Jordan, and I see you are here, Mark Meadows who is now I guess the head of your Freedom Caucus, or the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. \u00a0He actually said this is likely to fail in the Senate. \u00a0You don't think this is going to pass in the Senate? \u00a0 REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: \u00a0The repeal will pass, but some of the replacement mechanisms and policies, they are going to require the 60 vote threshold to get those through. \u00a0So that's a little harder. \u00a0But the most important thing, Sean, is we actually repeal it. \u00a0That is step one. \u00a0The president-elect is exactly right. \u00a0Health care will be better and cost less when we get rid of Obamacare. \u00a0So let's make sure we keep promise to the American people. \u00a0 Today was just step one. \u00a0There's a long process to come. \u00a0Let's do it as quick as we can, but let's do it all. \u00a0Every mandate, every regulation, every single tax has to go. \u00a0Then we'll have a chance to have the market work and that is part of the replacement is simply getting rid of Obamacare with repeal so you can have a market work and bring down costs and provide affordable health care to the families across this country. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0Louie Gohmert, a lot of conservatives are writing and calling my radio show and tweeting out their concern about three things, the $1 trillion infrastructure without a plan to pay for it. \u00a0They are concerned about increasing the debt over the next 10 years, $9.7 trillion. \u00a0And they're concerned that some remarks Paul Ryan made last night promising any illegal immigrant that he wouldn't allow immigration officials to deport her, in other words not following the law. \u00a0That's the current law of the land. \u00a0What is your reaction to that? \u00a0Are you hearing the same thing on your end? REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, R-TEXAS: \u00a0Yes, the number one thing we do first is repeal ObamaCare. \u00a0We can multitask. \u00a0I know there are Democrats who are having trouble with that. \u00a0But we can multitask. \u00a0We can repeal ObamaCare. We can go in and let a wall start being built. \u00a0And I do think that Mexico is ultimately going to realize that once we cut off the flow of drugs back and forth and the people that are paying the drug cartels to come across, then Mexico quits being such a corrupt country with all the drug cartels, and they are going to want to pay us, because they will zoom up to be not 62nd in the number of economics -- HANNITY: \u00a0Let me ask a question. \u00a0Are any of you three concerned about the issues that I have raised that I'm hearing from my listeners? \u00a0A $1 trillion infrastructure without a plan to pay for it. \u00a0Now, repatriation money, energy money, savings, ObamaCare, all of that can add to it. \u00a0But should have a plan to pay for the infrastructure $trillion? \u00a0What about the $9.7 trillion in the debt increase over 10 years, and thirdly, Paul Ryan saying last night this woman is not going to leave even though that is a law of the land. \u00a0I'm hearing a lot of about it. \u00a0Any of you three hearing about this? \u00a0 GOHMERT: \u00a0I've got insurances that look, this is a vehicle, Louie, this $9.7 or however many trillion in this budget, forget about it. \u00a0This is a vehicle. \u00a0They promised me it will not end up beating us. \u00a0No, you already agreed to these numbers. \u00a0Marsha hasn't, Jim hasn't, the Freedom Caucus hasn't. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0Real quick, Marsha. \u00a0 BLACKBURN: \u00a0One of the things when we talk about infrastructure that people are saying is, look, we want you to look at broadband expansion, rural broadband. \u00a0That is the primary infrastructure issue. \u00a0And there are ways for us to address that. \u00a0And I think we will do that. \u00a0And it will not having a negative impact to the debt. \u00a0We have to get the debt and the deficit, the annual deficit and the approved debt dealt with. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0All right, guys. \u00a0Good to see you all. \u00a0I will see you guys when I am in Washington next week and the week after. \u00a0Coming up next tonight right here on \"Hannity.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: \u00a0Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us, and they will reimburse us for the cost of this wall. \u00a0That will happen. \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: \u00a0President-elect Donald Trump keeping his promise that Mexico will pay for the border wall. \u00a0Up next, I go one-on-one with our own Geraldo Rivera straight ahead, tonight, right here on \"Hannity.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: \u00a0Mexico in some form, and there are many forms, will reimburse us, and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. \u00a0That will happen. Whether it's a tax or a whether it's a payment, probably less likely that it's a payment, but it will happen. \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: \u00a0President-elect Trump, he says Mexico will pay for the wall. \u00a0But Mexico's president Enrique Pena Nieto, he said the country will not be paying for it. \u00a0Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: \u00a0(SPANISH) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: \u00a0But he is trying to meet with and have meetings with Donald Trump. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Because they lost Carrier, Fiat Chrysler, and Ford and probably a lot of other companies spending money and the peso is tanking. Joining us now with reaction, former FOX senior advisor, not former, Geraldo Rivera. GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: \u00a0Senior adviser now. HANNITY: \u00a0Because you went to Trump Tower today. \u00a0 RIVERA: \u00a0I just loved him. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0How'd it go? RIVERA: \u00a0He was my former boss on \"Celebrity Apprentice\" who was wonderful. HANNITY: \u00a0You came in second. RIVERA: \u00a0I came in second. \u00a0But we actually joke, imagine if had beat Leeza Gibbons in the current climate. \u00a0It would be sort of like sleeping in the hallway. Now it was great seeing him and Melania was so gracious. \u00a0They were with Senator and Mrs. Blunt over there as they were leaving, and Senator Blunt reminded Donald of something he knew, that even when he was down and out, president-elect Trump, I always said he had it chance, that he had a fighting chance. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0Great admirer of him. \u00a0You always liked him. \u00a0 RIVERA: \u00a0Melania remembered Erica's name. \u00a0It was so sweet. \u00a0They invited us to the White House. \u00a0It was that kind of visit. \u00a0It was really a very friendly. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0So what you say to the all the snowflakes out there on your side of the aisle some times that are freaking out at everything he does? \u00a0 RIVERA: \u00a0Let me just reject the characterization of just what side of the aisle I'm on -- \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0You're a liberal Republican. RIVERA: \u00a0I think that's fair. \u00a0I am a Rockefeller Republican. \u00a0 I think that one of the reasons I wanted very publicly to embrace the president-elect is that he is the 45th president of the United States. \u00a0And he will be everybody's president. \u00a0And we wish him a great presidency for all of our sakes. \u00a0 And it distresses me when I see how low his poll numbers are going into the inauguration next week. \u00a0I mean, come on, ladies and gentlemen, you're not going to have two countries here. \u00a0We have one country. \u00a0You want the president to succeed. \u00a0His success is all of our success. \u00a0Specifically, I did the one -- it wasn't even nearly discordant, the one thing I said, you and I, Mr. President-elect, have differed on the issue of immigration. \u00a0And you saw with the wall, a very divisive issue. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0You don't care about the wall? \u00a0 RIVERA: \u00a0I understand the emotion and the passion that has led to the wall. Here is my bigger fear, Sean. \u00a0I think that you really will understand where I'm coming from. \u00a0He talked about Carrier and General Motors and Ford, all correct. \u00a0He has harnessed or grabbed back businesses that have fled or were attempting to flee the United States. \u00a0But now you are going to build a wall. \u00a0But what happens to all of those Mexicans now that would've worked for Ford or General Motors or Ford, or Carrier. \u00a0We need Mexico to be a successful country if we're going to stem immigration. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0But I always stop here and say there are 43 million Americans on food stamps, 50 million in poverty and 95 million out of the labor force. America first, you can't help others before we fix our own problems. \u00a0 RIVERA: \u00a0I have no problem with that either, except if you are really a capitalist free trader, we have to figure a way, what's best for the goose is best for the gander. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0But you are the guy that lost the job to an illegal immigrant who is going to work for a low amount of money. \u00a0And of the competition, 8 million illegals we know work in this country now. \u00a0Those 8 million jobs would otherwise go to Americans. \u00a0 RIVERA: \u00a0Everything you say is true, everything you say is true. HANNITY: \u00a0Except can you imagine the disorder when all those borders. What's the 30 year old Mexican guy who worked there, was going to work in the General Motors plans, and he's just over the line in Juarez, what is he going to do now? \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0We have our own problems. \u00a0They have theirs. \u00a0There might be some mutually beneficial deals. \u00a0 RIVERA: \u00a0But the idea of the North American Free Trade Agreement was the Mexico, Canada, and the United States are all in the -- yes, because the United States was getting shortchanged. \u00a0And he also, the president-elect was very strong on, I just got the F35. \u00a0They offered me $600 million discount on it. \u00a0I want even more than that. \u00a0 HANNITY: \u00a0We know him well. \u00a0Everything with him is a negotiation. \u00a0 By the way, I would say to him, can we do an interview? \u00a0Can we just do two segments? \u00a0Can I just one do one segment? \u00a0Everything is a negotiation. (LAUGHTER) RIVERA: \u00a0He loves you, too. HANNITY: \u00a0Good to see you, Geraldo. \u00a0 And coming up, a very important \"Question of the Day.\" That's next straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: \u00a0Time for our \"Question of the Day.\" So why do you think the media loves, loves, loves, loves, worships, adores President Obama and is so hostile to President-elect Trump? \u00a0Go to Facebook.com\/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter. \u00a0Quick programming note, starting on Monday, don't miss Martha's brand-new show, \"The First 100 Days.\" That's starts this Monday at 7:00 p.m. here on the FOX News channel. \u00a0All the time we have for tonight. \u00a0Thank you for being with us. \u00a0Have a great weekend. \u00a0We'll see you back here on Monday, and we'll be in D.C. for the rest of the week. \u00a0  Bye-bye, last week, one week from today, new president. \u00a0Thank God. \u00a0See you Monday.

John Cornyn said Sunday he'd worked the phones all weekend trying to win support for the Senate health care bill and was \"optimistic\" the legislation would pass.  \"It's hard,\" he told a small group of reporters when asked how negotiations were going between sessions at the Koch retreat. \"But there's no excuse for failure. ... When people want to get to 'yes' you can have good faith negotiation and get them there.\" \"But it's going to be close,\" Cornyn said. He noted that he had been working directly with Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Dean Heller of Nevada to address their differing concerns about the bill.  When asked whether the Senate could wait until after the Fourth of July recess, he suggested that would weaken the bill's chances. \"We don't have the luxury of waiting around,\" he said. \"It's not going to get any easier.\" The Texas senator described the period around August 1 as the \"drop-deadline.\"  \"We're trying to make sure we keep the rates down, stabilize the system, bring down rates, protect pre-existing condition coverage and do responsible Medicaid reform,\" Cornyn said.   Asked whether President Trump was doing enough to get the bill passed, he said: \"We're trying to hold him back a little bit.\"  Cornyn, who serves as the Senate's whip, made the remarks to reporters while attending the Koch network's donor retreat here in Colorado Springs. Ironically a number of his targets, who are either opposing the bill in its current form or remain uncommitted, were in the audience here. Sen. Ben Sasse, who is uncommitted, joked during a forum that he has a bruise just inside his left collarbone from Cornyn's thumb on his shoulder. As the Senate's number two Republican, it is Cornyn's job to pressure his colleagues to support the bill.   Cruz may offer two amendments this week that could ease the bill's passage, but he would not discuss his strategy during a brief conversation at the retreat. He said leaders were well aware of the policy priorities he has been pushing for the bill for many months.  On Saturday, US Rep. Mark Meadows \u2014 who was intimately involved in the House healthcare negotiations \u2014 said he could envision a scenario in which the Senate passed the bill this week, the House votes Friday and President Trump signs the bill on the Fourth of July.  \"Wow, he is super optimistic,\" Cornyn responded when asked about that scenario. \"That would be fine with me; I'm just trying to get through Thursday night \u2014 the vote-a-rama,\" a reference to a series of votes on proposed amendments to the bill that could go late into the evening.

The decision came down to the definition of one word: sex.  How the case played out Prosecutors in Cabell County alleged that Steward Butler in April 2015 was riding in the car with some friends in Huntington when he saw two men kiss on the sidewalk. Butler allegedly \"voiced homophobic slurs toward\" the men, exited the vehicle and punched both of them, knocking one to the ground.  The next month, a grand jury indicted Butler on two counts of battery and two counts of violating an individual's civil rights.   Butler challenged the civil rights charges and those were dismissed by a circuit court after \"concluding that the word 'sex' in the West Virginia legal code was plain and unambiguous and could not be expanded to include 'sexual orientation.\" Prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeals.  The decision In Tuesday's ruling, the court was asked to mull the meaning of the word \"sex\" and if that includes \"sexual orientation.\" Thirty years ago, the state Legislature defined a civil rights crime as a \"threat, intimidation and\/or injury to another person or another person's property because of specifically enumerated characteristics, including the victim's 'sex,'\" the  decision states .   Citing definitions from three different dictionaries and a nationwide review of hate crime laws, the decision imparts it \"indisputably demonstrates that \"sex\" and \"sexual orientation\" are being treated as distinct categories.\"  In the war of words, the court ruled that what's in the Legislature's code stands: \"Based upon the common and plain meaning of the word 'sex,' as well as the Legislature's clear intent, we are left with the ineluctable conclusion that the word 'sex' does not include 'sexual orientation.'\" Raymond Nolan, attorney for Butler, agreed with the decision. \"It was a legislation function and the Supreme Court applied the law correctly.\" The justices' ruling points out more than two dozen efforts to add \"sexual orientation\" to the statute have failed. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said he understood the rationale. \"The facts of this case are deeply disturbing and heinous, and I remain steadfast in describing the alleged behavior as despicable, but such conduct does not give the judicial system a license to rewrite state law,\" Morrisey's office said in a statement. \"That authority lies with the state Legislature and this decision preserves that balance.\" \"I'm not saying the opinion that the law shouldn't be changed and neither did the court. But at the time that this occurred, the law of West Virginia did not include that class as protected by the law,\" Nolan said.   Others said the ruling was a step in the wrong direction. Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's president and CEO, said: \"At a time when anti-LGBTQ hate violence is on the rise, this ruling reiterates the need to advocate for LGBTQ-inclusive hate-crime laws in all states across the nation.\" The dissent \"The pertinent question is not whether the statute contains the words \"sexual orientation.\" Rather, it is whether the crime was committed because of the victims' sex,\" Justice Margaret L. Workman  wrote in dissent .   While Workman agrees that the statute does not include the \"two magic words\" sexual orientation, she said \"this court adopted an overly narrow focus, metaphorically missing the forest for the trees.\"  \"The majority's answer is overly simplistic and constricted; the absence of the specific reference does not definitively resolve the question presented by this case,\" she wrote. While the civil rights charges cannot go forward, prosecutors can proceed with battery charges against Butler.

Cruz, locked in a now daily, heated fight with his GOP rival, needled Rubio for missing a high-profile vote that morning on the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill. Both Rubio and Cruz opposed the deal, with Rubio at one point this week saying Republicans should try to slow it down, but only Cruz returned to Washington to actually vote \"no.\" Though he spent much of the first day of his southern tour mired in an immigration war that is growing increasingly nasty by the day, Cruz's campaign joined the chorus of Republicans targeting Rubio for his missed Senate votes. At a campaign stop near Richmond, Virginia, only a couple of hours from the Capitol, Cruz hit his fellow senator gently. \"I'm going to let Marco defend his own voting record. I can tell you that I flew back to Washington, D.C. today to vote against this omnibus,\" Cruz told reporters. But the candidate's aides were much more biting, spending much of Friday highlighting Rubio's past attendance, using hashtags like #NoShowMarco and ridiculing his light footprint on the campaign trail. The Texas senator has noted in prior appearances of times he canceled fundraisers to make Washington votes he sees as impactful. \".@marcorubio FOUND! - Missed the spending bill vote today b\/c he had 1 event in a row in Iowa - a record-setting breakneck pace for Marco,\" Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler tweeted. Rubio, who was campaigning in Iowa on Friday before an event in Missouri, defended his missed vote in an interview with CBS, saying: \"In essence, not voting for it is a vote against it.\" Ken Cuccinelli endorses Cruz Cruz's new move came as he looked to continue to rebuke Rubio for his attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2013, a bill that Cruz opposed, in part, over its pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The surging presidential contender, in a new television ad released by his campaign Friday evening, shows Iowa voters a 2013 black-and-white photograph of a laughing Rubio standing alongside two prominent Senate Democrats. But Cruz was unable to totally turn the conversation back to Rubio and away from himself. Cruz authored an amendment during the 2013 battle that Rubio argues shows Cruz's support for legalization, and Cruz spent most of a 20-minute interview with Fox News' Greta Van Susteren testily defending his past record. \"No, it did not say it would have legal status,\" Cruz told a skeptical Van Susteren, who repeatedly charged that Cruz would have done just that. \"Read it as many times as you'd like.\" Looking to toughen his contrast with Rubio, Cruz this week ruled out legalization unequivocally, a position he has been resistant to take for much of the campaign. And on Friday, he spelled out in the most specific terms yet just how far he would go to deport undocumented immigrants, saying he would expel those apprehended by authorities but not quite saying whether he would authorize a new special force to apprehend them. Repeatedly during the confrontational back-and-forth, Cruz tried to shift the scrutiny away from his record and back to Rubio's. And on Friday, his campaign received a fresh surrogate in Ken Cuccinelli, the head of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a Washington pressure group despised by Senate leadership for looking to replace Republican incumbents. The endorsement of Cuccinelli, the former attorney general in Virginia and a GOP candidate for governor, was not unexpected -- his top political aide at SCF, Matt Hoskins,  has already been working for Cruz  behind the scenes. But it gave Cruz a new ally in the immigration wars, with Cuccinelli alleging Friday onstage in Richmond that some are trying to \"muddy the waters\" over Cruz's voting record. The Texas senator has portrayed Rubio's decision to back the 2013 bill as motivated primarily by winning over top Republican moneymen, and on Friday he mocked that Rubio was enamored by the fame as well. \"Back in 2013, the Rubio campaign believed it would benefit them politically if they broke their promises to the Florida voters and pushed amnesty,\" Cruz said. \"Remember, that was back when Senator Rubio was on the cover of Time magazine named 'The Savior.' Well, they're regretting that decision now.\"   ","articles_date":"18 12 2015","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2015\/12\/18\/politics\/ted-cruz-marco-rubio-attendance-record\/index.html","articles_title":"Cruz opens new front of attack against Rubio","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":63,"issue":8,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"The nation's capital has officially become the latest safe haven for illegal immigrants. District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Gray on Wednesday signed an executive order instructing police officers not to question people about their immigration status -- even people who are arrested on other matters -- unless immigration status is directly related to a criminal investigation. \"This executive order ensures public safety by ensuring that our police resources are deployed wisely and our immigrant communities feel safe cooperating with those who are sworn to protect them,\" Gray said in a statement. \"The district is home to thousands of immigrants,\" he added. \"If they are afraid to cooperate with authorities on criminal investigations because they fear it might endanger their presence in the   or the presence of a loved one, then it endangers their public safety and that of our entire city.\" Although district officials say the order only confirms a longstanding policy, critics still blasted the move. \"This is an abomination,\" said Corey Stewart, the Republican chairman-at-large of   County of Virginia, which is about 25 miles south of D.C. Stewart's county has sued the Department of Homeland Security twice, seeking information on 4,000 illegal immigrants that the county has arrested and turned over to Homeland Security for deportation. \"This is the capital of the United States,\" Stewart told FoxNews.com, \"and to have the nation's capital as a sanctuary city where essentially federal law is not going to be enforced sends all the wrong messages -- not just in the United States but around the world.\" The term \"sanctuary city\" is used to describe places where local officials refuse to enforce federal immigration laws and undocumented workers are free to seek jobs, housing or local government services without fear of deportation unless targeted by federal agencies. Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Paul Quander said the order does not mean the district is opting out of a mandatory federal program called Secure Communities, which directs local agencies to share fingerprints collected from people in local jails with the Department of  . The program is expected to be in place nationwide by 2013. But Stewart noted Secure Communities is only relevant once people are arrested and jailed. \"So the fact they they're going to comply with Secure Communities is of little consequence.\" In signing the order, Gray said he wanted to clarify that the local police in district are not in the business of enforcing federal immigration laws.","articles_date":"19 10 2011","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2011\/10\/19\/mayor-orders-dc-police-to-stop-checking-peoples-immigration-papers.html","articles_title":"D.C.

Here are some of the stories we are watching.  \u2022  The former C.E.O. of Massey Energy plans to run for U.S. Senate. \u2022  Where have all the media deals gone? \u2022  Mars invests in Kind, a step toward a more healthful empire. \u2022 One of the biggest German IPOs in years could arrive next year. \u2022  Cineworld holds talks to buy Regal. Want this in your own email inbox each morning?  Here\u2019s the sign-up . Two senators \u2014  Ron Johnson of Wisconsin  and Steve Daines of Montana \u2014 have argued the Republican tax plans give big corporations preferential treatment compared with pass-throughs. The problem with their argument is it\u2019s wrong.  The New York Times\u2019s Patricia Cohen reports : The key point here is that corporations and their investors are taxed twice: Pass-through businesses, meanwhile, are taxed just once: But even in Republican rewrite of the tax code \u2014 in which the corporate rate is lowered to 20 percent \u2014 pass-throughs still come out on top. That again is because corporation are taxed twice. Six months ago, Don Blankenship \u2014 the former C.E.O. of Massey Energy and once one of the most-feared men in the coal industry \u2014 shed his label as federal inmate 12393-088. Now Mr. Blankenship, who was convicted of crimes related to the explosion at the Massey-run Upper Big Branch mine in 2010 that killed 29 men, is pursuing a new career: senator. West Virginia\u2019s WCHS  reported today that Mr. Blankenship had filed federal election papers to run in the Republican primary for United States Senator in West Virginia next year. The winner of Republican primary would face Democratic incumbent Senator Joe Manchin III in the 2018 election. One thing Mr. Blankenship won\u2019t have a problem with is name recognition: He\u2019s one of the best-known figures in West Virginia, both for his decade-long tenure as the C.E.O. of Massey and then for his downfall after the mine explosion. Our colleague David Segal noted the onetime mogul\u2019s corporate achievements in  a 2015 profile : Mr. Blankenship was eventually convicted of having deliberately skirted federal mining safety requirements. It\u2019s a charge he has consistently denied, and he has called himself an \u201cAmerican political prisoner.\u201d But Massey was left low after the Upper Big Branch explosion, the worst American mining disaster in four decades. The company  sold itself to a rival , Alpha Natural Resources, in 2011 for $7.1 billion. Alpha in turn filed for bankruptcy in 2015, battered by a plunge in coal prices. The company\u2019s future remains questionable despite having  emerged from Chapter 11 protection  last year. There\u2019s no guarantee that Mr. Blankenship will square off against Mr. Manchin, who criticized Mr. Blankenship for his role in the explosion. Bloomberg notes that at least two other candidates  plan to run  for the Republican nomination. There has certainly been a lot of talk about media mergers in recent weeks. Disney ,  Verizon  and  Comcast  have all expressed interest in portions of 21st Century Fox. The Meredith Corporation  agreed to purchase  Time Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at nearly $3 billion. And hanging over all that is the antitrust fight over AT&T\u2019s proposed $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner. But all this news may have obscured the fact that media deal making has slowed markedly this year. So far in 2017, the value of announced media deals in 2017 is down 69 percent in the United States from a year ago and 57 percent globally, according to Thomson Reuters. The total volume of these deals is at its lowest level since 2013 in the United States and 2012 worldwide. This slowdown is unlikely to reverse soon. The Trump administration\u2019s  lawsuit to block AT&T\u2019s takeover of Time Warner  has ignited a guessing game about what type of media deals could get done. As Andrew and Michael wrote last week : So until there is a conclusion to the AT&T-Time Warner deal, big media acquisitions are likely on hold. As some consumers move away from sugary sweets like M & Ms and Snickers, Mars is  buying a minority stake  in a maker of snack bars that uses ingredients like quinoa and amaranth. Mars\u2019s investment in Kind gives the smaller company a valuation of more than $4 billion \u2014 five times its value three years ago. Their shared goals: Expand Kind from being a snack maker into a health-food empire, and expand its international sales. \u201cJob No. 1 is taking it global. Job No. 2 is, what other categories either are we already in, or we can easily get into, that meet the Kind promise?\u201d Grant F. Reid, the Mars chief executive, told Andrew in an interview. The numbers:  Kind\u2019s 2017 sales thus far are close to $720 million, according to Euromonitor. It\u2019s the third-biggest snack-bar brand worldwide, behind Nature Valley and Clif Bar. The back story:  Kind\u2019s founder, Daniel Lubetzky, had been considering selling a minority stake \u2014 but was interested primarily in staying private. Mars, one of the biggest privately held American corporations, had long been interested in striking up a partnership. And, given its deal-making history, Mars could end up owning Kind outright down the road. ____________________________ Today\u2019s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. ____________________________ Siemens said on Wednesday that  it plans to list its medical technology solutions business  in Frankfurt in the first half of 2018 in what is expected to be one of the biggest German initial public offerings in years. The Healthineers unit is among Siemens\u2019 most profitable businesses, generating 13.8 billion euros, or about $16 billion, in revenue in the company\u2019s 2017 fiscal year, which ended in September. The Healthineers business supplies technology to the health care industry, including diagnostic imaging and laboratory diagnostics. Siemans did not disclose the size of the listing or the potential price range but is expected to sell a minority stake of up to 25 percent in the business. Some analysts have estimated that the listing could value the unit at up to \u20ac40 billion. Siemens first announced plans to list a minority stake in the business last year. Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are acting as global coordinators on the listing. The British cinema owner Cineworld confirmed on Wednesday that it was in advanced discussions to potentially acquire Regal Entertainment Group for about $3.1 billion. If the deal were to be completed, the two largest movie theater chains in the United States would be owned by overseas companies. AMC Entertainment is owned by the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda. The confirmation came after Regal said on Tuesday night that it was in discussions with Cineworld about an all-cash transaction to acquire Regal for $23 a share. Shares of Regal are up nearly 5 percent to $20.59 in recent trading. Regal\u2019s stock has come under pressure this year because of a poor run for box-office movies but also the threat from Netflix, Amazon and other digital streaming companies. That threat is only going to get bigger.  Breakingviews columnist Liam Proud writes : The Justice Department  has argued  in its lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion Time Warner deal that putting together AT&T, which owns DirecTV and provides broadband internet service, and Time Warner, which owns HBO and Turner channels like TNT and CNN, puts too much power in one corporation. But  AT&T said  in a court filing  that it is battling tech giants with plenty of negotiating leverage. Google\u2019s YouTube, for instance, began life without any Time Warner networks, suggesting \u2014 to AT&T, at least \u2014 that channels like TNT, CNN and TBS were inessential. Another key part of AT&T\u2019s filing To show that it would not abuse any increase in power that buying Time Warner would afford, AT&T said that it had offered rival distributors the same sort of deal that the government allowed in the last big vertical media merger, Comcast\u2019s purchase of NBCUniversal. That includes: \u2022 Letting rival video providers make use of arbitration in any dispute involving Turner\u2019s channels. \u2022 Preventing Turner from shutting down its service, or \u201cgoing dark,\u201d in the case of any dispute. Recode points out that the concession is  a big deal . The AT&T flyaround \u2022 Days before the government\u2019s lawsuit, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, met with the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, to offer one last peace proposal. ( Bloomberg ) \u2022 Mr. Stephenson will speak at the Economic Club of New York today at noon, and his talk will be livestreamed. ( Economic Club of N.Y. ) A tax overhaul proposal emerged from the Senate Budget Committee after two notable Republican dissidents, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Bob Corker of Tennessee, said their concerns were resolved. Mr. Corker, who objected to how much the plan would add to the national deficit, said that details of a provision, that would reverse tax cuts if economic growth fell short of expectations, would be released tomorrow, according to  Politico . But such a provision worries Republican colleagues like John Kennedy of Louisiana, who  told the NYT , \u201cI\u2019m just not too excited about this idea of automatically tying our hands.\u201d The Washington flyaround \u2022 President Trump is fighting with Democratic leaders as the government prepares for a potential shutdown when its funding expires on Dec. 8.

And what kind of border will Northern Ireland have with Ireland, its southern neighbor? Reports of progress pushed up the value of the British pound this morning to about $1.34. The opposition to the F.C.C.\u2019s plans to repeal the Obama-era regulations has included more than 200,000 phone calls placed to Congress and about 500,000 comments on the F.C.C.\u2019s website. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be middle ground on this issue,\u201d John Beahn, a lawyer at Skadden Arps who specializes in regulation, told  the NYT . Ajit Pai criticizes Twitter:  The F.C.C. chairman  attacked the social network  for harshly regulating conservatives\u2019s accounts, apparently referring to its new policy of suspending and de-verifying some white nationalists and far-right users, according to the WaPo. Critics\u2019 corner, F.C.C. edition \u2022 Farhad Manjoo writes, \u201cThe internet doesn\u2019t have to be a corporate playground. That\u2019s just the path we\u2019ve chosen.\u201d ( NYT ) \u2022 Ben Thompson writes, \u201cTo believe that Chairman Pai is right is not to be against net neutrality; rather, it is to believe that the FCC\u2019s 2015 approach was mistaken.\u201d ( Stratechery ) Xavier Rolet is leaving , weeks after TCI Fund Management, a big investor in the stock exchange, warned that he was being forced out. His departure comes months after regulators had blocked the market operator\u2019s plans to merge with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. But TCI is also getting something that it had wanted, sort of: Donald Brydon, the L.S.E. chairman whom the fund wanted replaced, said that he would step down in 2019. But it\u2019s bound to get messier. While a federal judge has denied an emergency request by the agency\u2019s deputy director, Leandra English, to stop Mick Mulvaney from taking over as acting director, her lawsuit is likely to proceed. While Mr. Mulvaney sits in the director\u2019s seat, however, he can do a lot to hobble an agency that he has derided as a \u201csad, sick joke.\u201d He has issued a 30-day freeze on issuing any new rules or regulations. And experts say that he can abandon investigations or shrink the bureau\u2019s budget, according to  the WaPo How else to describe the decision by the judge overseeing the company\u2019s court battle with Alphabet\u2019s self-driving car unit to delay the trial? He did so after discovering that Uber had not produced a letter that he said was potentially relevant evidence. Here\u2019s what Judge William Alsup said, according to Cade Metz of  the NYT : What was in said letter:  Assertions by a former Uber employee to the ride-hailing giant\u2019s deputy general counsel that the company had an internal team that was responsible for efforts \u201cto evade, impede, obstruct, influence several ongoing lawsuits against Uber.\u201d And it used anonymous servers and apps with self-destructing messages to avoid creating paper trails. An Uber spokeswoman said that nothing in the letter affected the merits of the lawsuit.

Joe Manchin is urging federal regulators to ban Bitcoin amid turmoil surrounding the virtual currency.\u00a0 ADVERTISEMENT Manchin, D-W.Va., said in a press release that he has sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and other officials urging them to bar the use of Bitcoin in the U.S., calling it \u201cunstable and disruptive to our economy.\u201d Manchin\u2019s call comes a day after Bitcoin was dealt a major blow when one of its major exchanges, Mt. Gox, went bust after secretly racking up catastrophic losses. The virtual currency, which started in 2009, allows people to make one-to-one transactions, buy goods and services and exchange money across borders without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties. Bitcoins themselves are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. Though Bitcoin is beloved by an eclectic group of die-hard fans, it has also struggled to shake an association with illicit and criminal behavior. One notable example is its role in powering the now-defunct online drug marketplace Silk Road. Manchin says Bitcoin has proven to be dangerous, saying the currency is susceptible to hackers and scam artists and makes it too easy for people to purchase illegal drugs or weapons online. \u201cThe very features that make Bitcoin attractive to some also attract criminals who are able to disguise their actions from law enforcement,\u201d he said. Manchin also says the volatile currency could be detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying American consumers stand to lose if Bitcoin\u2019s value follows current trends. \u201cAs of December 2013, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows 1.3% inflation, while a recent media report indicated Bitcoin CPI has 98% deflation,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cIn other words, spending Bitcoin now will cost you many orders of wealth in the future.

With over 99% of  precincts counted  (and not including votes for any third parties), Democratic turnout did top one million in a midterm primary for the first time since 2002, but it still lagged well behind the over 1.5 million votes cast in the Republican primary. Put another way, 60% of all votes cast in Tuesday night's primary went to Republican candidates. That's 20 points more than the 40% that went to Democratic candidates.  The margin has shrunk significantly from 2010 and 2014, when the margin between votes cast in the Republican and Democratic primaries ran closer to 40 percentage points.  The margin, however, is not any better and is actually slightly worse for them than it was in 2006, another year when Democrats turned out exceptionally well. Republicans cast a little more than 56% of the primary votes to the Democrats' 44%.  That year, Democrats took back both the US House and Senate, but Republicans easily won the major statewide races in Texas, including the governorship and a US Senate election.  That means if primary turnout in other states look like 2006, it might be another sign (along with the  generic congressional ballot  and  special elections ) that 2018 is shaping up to be a big Democratic year nationwide.  But there's also no way one can look at the results and think Democrats are going to win in Texas in 2018, which is not good news for Democratic candidates like Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who is hoping to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz in November.  All of this, of course, depends on how indicative primary turnout is for the general election. Dating back to 1970 , turnout by each party in midterm primaries in Texas has not necessarily been associated with strength in statewide general elections. Democrats had far better turnout in the 1994 primary, for example. Later that year, Republican George W. Bush and Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison  would respectively win  the gubernatorial and US Senate elections in the state easily. No Democrat has won a race for either since.  More recently, there are signs that primary turnout may tell us something. Nate Cohn of the New York Times  has shown  that nationally turnout in primaries since 2004 seems to predict outcomes in the fall.","articles_date":"7 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/07\/politics\/texas-democrats-struggle-in-primary-vote\/index.html","articles_title":"Democratic turnout could signal blue wave in November -- but not in Texas","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":68,"issue":8,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"James C. Moore is a business consultant and principal at Big Bend Strategies, a business development firm. He has authored four books on Texas politics and has written and reported on the state's government and history for four decades. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN) Texas has endured uncountable insults since the arrival of Stephen F. Austin in the 1800s. Few have been more enduring, however, than the now-hackneyed broadside from Union Army Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan, which was delivered at the end of the Civil War. \"If I owned Texas and hell,\" Sheridan said, \"I'd rent out Texas and live in hell.\"  Outlanders can vilify the state and become legends, but native folks have to be careful about backlash, especially those who choose to live as Tex-pats, which is a part of the problem confronting Laura Moser, who had resided in Washington, D.C., until a year ago, according to what  she told a Houston newspaper .  She is one of seven Democratic candidates in the Texas 7th congressional district primary contest, and she bad-mouthed Texas. From afar. While living in D.C. Oh my! Moser wrote in a Washington magazine , \"I'd sooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia\" than live in Paris, Texas. If you've traveled to the other Paris and the Texas version, you'd know they both have Eiffel Towers. The one in Texas is smaller, though, and has a cowboy hat sitting at the top, a flourish that would have never occurred to the French.  Picking on the lesser Paris wasn't the smartest move because Moser was returning home to Texas to run for Congress in the Democratic Primary. Her rhetorical blunder caught the attention of her opponents, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), which runs House races for the party. Moser, a writer and progressive activist, was accused by the party of being an opportunist and Washington insider who moved home just to run for Congress.  Yeah, so what? It happens, and legally. Tradition dictates, though, that party organizations generally stay out of picking candidates in primaries, but Moser's profile has the DCCC worried that it will blow a chance to win a congressional seat from Republican John Culberson. The conservative former state rep has not had a real challenger since voters sent him to Washington in 2000. Moser  has been endorsed  by Bernie Sanders' Our Revolution group, which is an imprimatur that certainly won't help her attract moderate Republicans in a general election. And she would need some of them to win. And that's really what worries the national Democratic leadership.  The organization might be correct. The Sander's progressive stances may give Moser a handicap in a Texas race, but this dustup is about more than a congressional race.  The national Democratic Party sticking its nose into a Texas primary reminds voters of suspicions that the last Democratic presidential campaign may have been rigged in Hillary Clinton's favor. There's no need to suspect the DCCC of anything in this race, however. It's right there  on its website  claiming Moser is a \"Washington insider\" who \"begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for congress.\"  Texas Democrats believe Culberson is vulnerable because Clinton  received more votes  in the district than Donald Trump in the last election, and they worry that meddling by the national party reduces their odds of winning the seat this time. That said, Democrats are also hopeful -- as early voting in Texas shows  a potential upturn  for the party. But their chances might not be as great as they think, though. The state's 7th congressional district has been in Republican hands since its lines were redrawn in 1966 by court order. Former President George H.W. Bush represented the 7th and now makes his home in the Houston district, along with GOP Sen. Ted Cruz and various energy billionaires, who are among the wealthiest people in America. Only the DCCC appears to be making an issue of Moser's Texas bona fides and has unloaded opposition research into the primary that says she still had Washington as her primary address in January. She had, however, stated publicly last May that she had already moved home to Texas.  The party published  her DC 2018 property tax public statement, which requires that it be her primary residence in order to get the homestead exemption that the document appears to show. The exemption is a tax break offered for seniors and individuals who live in and don't rent out their properties for income.  Things get trickier for the Democrats if Moser becomes one of the two candidates to make it to the expected runoff. Do they attack her as being too liberal for an historically conservative district and put their support behind the more centrist candidate in the runoff? Texas Dems are still divided over whether a liberal, progressive has a chance in the 7th district, and no small number of them are telling the national party to mind its own business and let Texans decide.  Moser might win the primary, and that would be even more embarrassing for the Democrats. Would the DCCC not support her campaign with resources? A political move of that nature could turn into a national controversy for the national Democrats at a time they are trying to win back the US House.  And their problems will suddenly be a lot bigger than petty slights to Paris, Texas.

Jones benefited from the unique vulnerabilities of his opponent, Republican Roy Moore, who was a deeply polarizing figure even before he was besieged by allegations that he had pursued relationships with teenage girls, some of them underage, while in his 30s.  But the coalition that Jones mobilized closely resembled the voter alignments that have powered other recent Democratic victories in governors' races in Virginia, North Carolina and Louisiana. Above all, Jones demonstrated that Democrats could simultaneously inspire passionate turnout from their base supporters, led by African-Americans, and make inroads with centrist white-collar white voters -- each of which, for different reasons, is recoiling from Donald Trump's tumultuous presidency. That combination allowed Jones to overcome Moore's lopsided margins among blue-collar, evangelical, older and rural whites -- the four building blocks of the Trump coalition.  Keeping momentum and agreement among those groups won't be easy, but Democrats see it as a possible pathway to majorities in the 2018 midterm elections.  \"It was definitely the most complicated, toughest thing I've ever been through, on the edge of your seat,\" said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic strategist who directed Jones' campaign. \"[But] Trump has created this middle ground where enough moderate and conservative Republicans and Democrats really want leadership about coming together and getting something done. ... I think that is the winning message of 2018.\"  Jones' victory was centered on minorities, millennial voters and college-educated suburban whites, especially women. That's exactly the formula Democrats now depend on in most states. But even with strong African-American support, Southern Democrats until recently come up short, largely because they haven't attracted nearly as many college-educated whites as their party does elsewhere.   Now, with Democratic constituencies energized and suburban swing voters uneasy about Trump, Southern Democrats are suddenly finding it more possibe to assemble the coalition that the party relies on in other regions. And that could create new opportunities for Democrats across the South, most immediately in suburban House districts in 2018, but potentially also in statewide contests such as the 2018 governor's race in Georgia and Senate battle in Tennessee.   \"I am not going to say that any place is going to be noncompetitive next year,\" says Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who has long specialized in Southern races. \"It all depends on the environment and how it shifts over the course of the next year, but it's hard to see it getting a whole lot more favorable for Republicans with Donald Trump as the face of the party.\"  Democrats still face a long road to re-establishing competitiveness across the South. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in all 11 states of the old Confederacy except for Virginia, typically by enormous margins. (Only a year before Jones' win, Trump carried Alabama by nearly 28 percentage points and 590,000 votes.) Even after Jones' win, Democrats still hold just four of the region's 22 Senate seats (including Mark Warner and Tim Kaine in Virginia and Bill Nelson in Florida). And Democrats control just three of the 11 Southern governor's mansions.   Yet Jones' victory continued a modest Southern Democratic revival that includes those three governor wins: one in 2017 (Ralph Northam in Virginia), one in 2016 (Roy Cooper in North Carolina) and the last in 2015 (John Bel Edwards in Louisiana.)    Even as they embraced most traditional Democratic priorities -- such as expanding access to Medicaid, defending the Affordable Care Act and ensuring equal treatment for gays -- each of those four candidates ran primarily as a consensus-builder in an increasingly polarized age.   While defending the ACA, opposing the GOP tax plan and affirming his support for legal abortion, Jones promised to seek common ground where possible with Trump and Republicans -- a message he repeated on CNN's \"State of the Union\" this Sunday. The most memorable television ad of Jones' campaign was a spot called \"Honor\" in which, speaking directly to the camera, he praised \"two brave men\" who fought on the Confederate and Union sides at Gettysburg during the Civil War and declared, \"There is honor in compromise and civility.\"  Trippi said Jones faced criticism from some Democratic activists who wanted a more pugnacious approach to Trump. But, he added, there was no evidence that Jones' call for common ground depressed turnout among the core Democratic groups. \"That message didn't keep the lid on our own energy and excitement,\" Trippi said. \"You get more angst from activist leaders than you do [from] voters. You gain far more than [you lose from] the few loud voices that don't like working with the other side.\"  Indeed, Jones achieved two broad campaign goals that some on the left have viewed as incompatible.  On the one hand, he was buoyed by big turnouts and huge margins among core Democratic constituencies. That was especially true among African-Americans, who made up slightly more of the vote, and voted slightly more heavily Democratic, last week than they did when President Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012, according to exit polls. But Jones also benefited from respectable turnout and a commanding margin among young voters, who gave him fully three-fifths of their votes. (He received a thumb on the scale, too, from the 5% of voters who were neither white nor black, a reflection of the increasing Hispanic, Asian and mixed race presence throughout the Southeast.)  John Anzalone, an Alabama-based Democratic pollster who worked on an independent expenditure effort supporting Jones, says that while Moore won very high percentages in his rural strongholds, they could not match the enhanced turnout in more urbanized Democratic-leaning areas. \"We turned out where we had to turn out our voters, and even though he did really well in his strongholds the turnout wasn't big enough,\" Anzalone said. \"We are getting people who have never come out in a midterm or special election, and they are disproportionately our people.\"  Jones also made deeper inroads among white-collar white voters, such as those in suburbs around Huntsville and Birmingham, than Southern Democrats have usually achieved. In 2016, for instance, exit polls showed that Clinton carried 45% of college-educated whites nationally but only about one-third or less in Florida, Texas and Georgia. In 2014, Democratic Senate candidates didn't win more than one-third of college-educated whites in any Southern state with an exit poll except North Carolina and Virginia. In 2012, the last time an exit poll was conducted in Alabama, Obama won only one-fifth of college-educated whites there.  Last week, though, the exit poll found that Jones won 40% of college-educated whites in Alabama, double Obama's share. That reaffirmed the movement evident in the Virginia race, where Northam reached 51% among college-educated whites, considerably more than Democrats had garnered in any recent statewide race there. Although exit polls weren't available in the June special election for a suburban House seat outside of Atlanta, Democrat Jon Ossoff could not have finished so close to Republican Karen Handel, the narrow winner, without significant gains among those voters too.  The movement toward Southern Democrats this year has been greatest among college-educated white women in both Virginia (where Northam carried 58% of them) and Alabama (where Jones took 45%). But each gained substantially among well-educated men too.   Ayres says the intense distaste for Trump among college-educated white women represents a clear and present danger for any Republican who must court a heavily suburban constituency, even in the South. \"If you put Alabama together with Virginia, it's very clear that college-educated suburban women are rejecting Trump and his style and what he has brought to the country,\" Ayres said. \"[This] is a logical extension of the patterns we saw in the presidential election in 2016. Republicans traded fast growing, large, better-educated counties for slow growing, smaller less well-educated counties. And it was a trade that worked well for Trump, barely, in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, but it's hardly a formula for long-term success.\"  Even amid these gains, the big blinking yellow light for Democrats is the continuing Republican hold on the blue-collar, evangelical and rural voters who play such a large role in many Southern states. Trippi said that while Trump's combative persona helped mobilize African-Americans and young people, and enlarged the opening for Jones with white-collar whites, the President showed a potent capacity to tug his coalition back toward Moore whenever it appeared to waver. \"He has this weird thing where he would help fuel our positive message [on working together] and then he would roll in and create the tribalism that would help them all move back to Moore,\" Trippi said.   Still, Jones -- like Ralph Northam and Roy Cooper before him -- wasn't annihilated among working-class white voters by quite as large a margin as Clinton or Obama or most Southern Democratic Senate candidates in 2014. Trippi said the campaign's research found that Trump's \"divisive negative style ... was starting to wear even on\" those voters, who have been Trump's most loyal.  Democrats still face many obstacles in the South. But Trump's turbulent presidency may be creating more opportunity than almost anyone anticipated for the party to begin overcoming them.","articles_date":"19 12 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/12\/19\/politics\/democrats-southern-strategy\/index.html","articles_title":"Democrats have a new Southern strategy","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":70,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) When former congressman Tom Perriello made his surprise entrance into the Virginia Democratic gubernatorial primary in January, the stage looked set for an intra-party proxy war -- the establishment, in the form of incumbent Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, put to the test by Perriello and the party's growing progressive insurgency. But while the campaign saw its share of sharp elbows, the dividing lines between the candidates were fuzzier than expected. The Clinton-Sanders redux race many expected -- and some hoped for -- never materialized. Instead, the animating questions were both broader, with President Donald Trump's long shadow looming, and narrower, as the candidates jostled over issues unique to the Commonwealth. Northam came out on top,  picking up about  55% of the vote to Perriello's 45%, with 81% of the state reporting. In the end, his initial focus on the White House might have tripped up Perriello, whose profile is less of a state politician than megaphone for the Trump-era angst of the national party. And that could be the ultimate implication of this race for Democrats, who will continue to ask whether making Trump the focus of every contest is a more direct path back to power than zeroing in on local issues. If Northam's victory is any indication -- and that too will be up for debate -- then Democrats might be wise not to bank on \"the resistance\" for too much, at least when they're vying for the support of their own party's rank-and-file.   Perriello drew headlines at the outset of the campaign for his full-throated assault on Trump, an apparent effort to nationalize the race and coalesce the growing opposition to the incoming administration's controversial agenda. Northam initially centered his focus on statewide questions. But as primary day neared, the competing ideas about what issues should drive the race dovetailed. Northam, a doctor, upped his attacks on Trump,  calling the President  a \"'narcissistic maniac\" in an ad last month. Despite their varying approaches, months on the trail have revealed two candidates as more alike than not.   \"Both of these candidates fit into the ideological tradition of (Democrats Terry) McAuliffe, (Tim) Kaine and (Mark) Warner,\" said Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson. \"This primary has been more of a contest of style, approach and focus than substantive policy differences.\" Perriello joined the race as resistance to the Trump agenda began to boom, and promised on the stump to make Virginia a bulwark against it. His bid was boosted soon thereafter by the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders and his political organization, \"Our Revolution,\" along with a laundry list of former aides to President Barack Obama.  Among the Obama veterans to line up behind Perriello were 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe and former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, who more recently served as a top aide on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, wrote  an op-ed  in the Washington Post to offer his blessing. Obama never joined Perriello on the campaign trail, as he did in 2010 when the congressman was fighting an ill-fated battle to keep his seat in the House. Still, Perriello touted his good relations with the popular former president,  using video  from the old re-election rally in a series of ads. One of the spots featured Obama, Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. At first expected to cruise to the nomination without a serious challenge, Northam countered with a broader slate of state-based support. The governor, Terry McAuliffe, backed his deputy. Virginia's Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, along with attorney general Mark Herring endorsed Northam. Both state House and Senate caucuses pledged their support just ahead of Perriello's announcement. As the campaign progressed, both candidates ran into roadblocks in the form of past votes that threatened to undermine their pitches to the party base. Perriello, who backed Obamacare, then defended his decision -- and the law -- when many of his Democratic colleagues backed off, was confronted on the trail for his support of the \"Stupak Amendment,\" a proposed Obamacare tweak that would have denied federal money to insurance plans offering abortion coverage. (Perriello apologized on the trail, repeatedly, and while he currently has a 100% rating from abortion rights group NARAL, Northam won their endorsement.) Northam encountered his own difficulties. He was attacked for taking money from the increasingly controversial Dominion Energy, a regulated monopoly that serves as the state's largest energy supplier. Perriello announced early on that he would not accept donations from the influential company.     Northam was also forced to cope with an admission that he voted -- in 2000 and 2004 -- for candidate and then President George W. Bush. Perriello drilled him on the decision throughout the campaign.  \"I'm the only person in this race that's been a Democrat my whole life,\" Perriello said at a forum in May. \"I voted for Democratic presidential candidates. I devoted my life for three years to trying to defeat George Bush's agenda while Ralph Northam was voting for him twice.\"  At a town hall in Richmond a month earlier, Perriello suggested those votes would hamstring Northam in a general election debate with the likely GOP nominee, Ed Gillespie, who served as the Republican National Committee chair during Bush's re-election campaign before eventually working in his White House for 18 months. For Democrats, the fight to keep hold of the governor's mansion Virginia is only beginning. Northam, Perriello, DNC chair Tom Perez, McAuliffe and others are slated to gather for a unity event on Wednesday.","articles_date":"13 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/13\/politics\/virginia-governor-democratic-primary-perriello-northam\/index.html","articles_title":"Democrats in Virginia made an important choice -- but it's not the one you think","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":71,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Democrats are jumping on Georgia congressional candidate Karen Handel for saying she's against a \"livable wage\" during a debate in the Peach State Tuesday night.

I do not support a livable wage.\" She added that she instead wants \"an economy that is robust with low taxes and regulation.\" Despite her follow-up, Handel's comments almost instantly went viral, and groups like the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee were quick to clip and widely share the moment.  \"Even after 15 years running for office, Karen Handel couldn't resist admitting she's against a livable wage,\" the DCCC said in an email blast Wednesday.

The memo, from the GOP and led by House Intelligence Committee's chairman, Devin Nunes, alleges that then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told the committee that no surveillance warrant would have been sought for a Trump campaign aide without the opposition research dossier on Trump written by ex-British intelligence office Christopher Steele. Democrats -- and a few Republicans -- shared their disapproval of the release of the document, which most of them initially called a \"dangerous\" move. Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, slammed the release of the memo, saying it was \"reckless and demonstrates an astonishing disregard for the truth.\" \"This will make it far more difficult for the Intelligence Committees to conduct meaningful, bipartisan oversight of intelligence activities in the future,\" he said in a statement. \"This action was also taken without regard to the damage it could do to our ability to protect Americans from threats around the globe.\" \"Law enforcement opposes this,\" tweeted Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat. \"The intelligence community opposes this. Even many Republicans oppose this. This is dangerous territory, it disrespects law enforcement, and it's an alarming partisan attack on efforts to investigate hostile foreign interference in our democracy.\" Their colleague, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, also criticized the release of the memo, echoing that it's \"dangerous.\" She tweeted, \".@realDonaldTrump's decision to declassify the partisan memo, made in cooperation w\/ Congressional Republicans, is a dangerous attack on our justice system and the rule of law.\"  Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon called the memo \"cherry-picked classified information\" in a statement.  \"This puts us in extremely dangerous territory,\" he said. \"It upends the relationship between the intelligence community and Congress, threatening the ability for different branches of government to work together to protect the American people's safety.\" And it wasn't just Democratic senators who slammed the decision to release the memo. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said the memo should have been further reviewed because of its \"implications for our national security.\" \"Oversight of the intelligence community, the FISA process, and this investigation are far too important to be tarnished by partisanship,\" she said in a statement. \"When the Senate Intelligence Committee released a controversial report some years ago, we spent months meeting with the intelligence community to redact sensitive information ...   This model of bipartisanship and careful vetting would have been a far better way to proceed.\" The divide in responses House Republicans praised Trump for deciding to release the memo, arguing it revealed problems with US surveillance. House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement he was \"glad\" the memo helps \"provide greater transparency.\" \"Unlike most judicial proceedings, the FISA system depends not on an adversarial process, but instead on the government providing a complete presentation of the facts and circumstances underlying its warrant applications,\" he said in a statement. \"It is clear from this memo that didn't happen in this case, and as a consequence an American's civil liberties may have been violated.\" He also said again  he supports Democrats  releasing their own memo, which charges that the Nunes memo is an attempt to help the White House with the Russia investigation. It argues that proper procedures were followed in obtaining FISA warrants. \"I reiterate my support for the similar release of the minority's memo once it is properly scrubbed of all intelligence sources and methods,\" he said. Rep. Trey Gowdy, who announced his retirement from Congress earlier this week and serves on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said the public should know the the facts behind the creation of the dossier. \"While this memo raises serious concerns with the FISA process, I have been and remain confident in the overwhelming majority of the men and women serving at the FBI and DOJ,\" he said on Twitter. \"As I have said repeatedly, I also remain 100 percent confident in Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The contents of this memo do not -- in any way -- discredit his investigation.\" Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz commended the release of the memo, saying in a statement it should \"cause all American citizens to be outraged, regardless of political affiliation.\" \"I read the memo as soon as it was released to Members of Congress, and my heart sank,\" he continued. \"Not only did it lay bare a systemic pattern of abuse within the FBI and the DOJ, it confirmed my worst fear: America's free and fair elections were being threatened from within.\" Iowa Rep. Steve King said in a statement that the memo proves that under the Obama administration, the FBI and the Department of Justice were \"weaponized\" against political opponents. \"The memo now commands FISA Warrant requests be released to Congress,\" he said in his statement. \"The statement that the FBI & the DOJ were 'weaponized' holds up pretty well.\" Meanwhile, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr declined to comment on the release of the memo. \"Sen. Burr won't have comment on the memo. The Committee's own investigation remains ongoing,\" a spokesman for Burr told CNN. This story has been updated.

The milestone is a boon to Hillary Clinton's chances of carrying the Sunshine State and its 29 electoral votes -- a prize so large that it would help her close off most of Donald Trump's paths to victory. But it's not all good news for Democrats: Their current lead is significantly smaller than the turnout advantage they had over registered Republicans at this point in 2008.  Clinton and her vice presidential running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, were in Florida this weekend. Even though Clinton's rally in Pembroke Pines was  cut short Saturday due to heavy rain , she visited two early voting locations near Miami, and her effort to churn out early voters might be working. More than 5.7 million Floridians have already hit the polls after about two weeks of in-person early voting. So far, 2,268,663 Democrats have cast their ballots and 2,261,383 Republicans have already voted. These are not results -- ballots aren't tallied until Election Day. But the numbers provide clues on who is voting and which party is turning out to vote. And while the numbers track voters' party affiliations, not all Democrats are voting for Clinton, and not all Republicans are supporting Trump. Early voting data in 3 key states show spike in Latino turnout The GOP lead was carried by strong numbers in absentee voting, and their overall edge stood at about 16,500 earlier this week. But Democratic turnout picked up steam, and they're now ahead by a little more than 7,200 votes, according to the latest numbers from the Florida Department of State. Democrats slowly chipped away at the Republican advantage, largely thanks to strong turnout from Hispanic voters. While they are more split in Florida than in other states, Hispanic voters disproportionately favor Democrats. And this year, turnout among Hispanics is up about 103% from where it was at this point in 2008, according to a CNN analysis of early voting data from Catalist. CNN has partnered with Catalist, a data company that works with progressive candidates and advocacy groups, academics and think tanks, to receive detailed early vote return information this year. Catalist's voter list connects returned ballots with demographic and registration information, such as party registration, gender and age, and allows a closer look at who has already cast a vote in the election. The huge growth among Hispanics is notable because they are the fastest growing ethnic group in the Florida electorate right now. Turnout is up across the board, compared to early voting in 2008. But it only increased by about 41% among white voters and only about 13% among black voters. The relatively small growth in African-American turnout helps explain why Democrats are behind their early voting pace from 2008, a year when then-Sen. Barack Obama carried the state by only 3%. Right now, registered Democrats are ahead by about 7,200 votes. That pales in comparison to the roughly 146,000-voter edge they saw at this point in 2008. African-Americans were 16% of the early voting electorate that year, but they're only about 13% of the electorate so far in 2016. An overwhelming majority of black voters in Florida are registered with the Democratic Party. Doing well in the early vote is absolutely critical in Florida, because a majority of voters cast early ballots in the past two presidential elections.

But their national parties are another story.  Jones' campaign has worked hard to convince Democrats to take seriously the former prosecutor's chances of defeating Moore -- the twice-removed former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice whose theocratic campaign message has alienated some moderate and pro-business Republicans.  \"Doug knows Alabama. He knows your heart, and he'll never let you down,\" Biden said Tuesday in Birmingham, echoing Jones' argument that Moore would be likely to embarrass the state.  The tactics are similar to those that carried Democrat John Bel Edwards past Republican Sen. David Vitter, who had been ensnared in a prostitution scandal, in the Louisiana governor's race in 2015.  But one big question for national Democrats is whether donors' desire to keep Moore out of the Senate will translate into huge and sustained fundraising figures that Jones would likely need.   Some donors could shy away from the Alabama race after being burned by this summer's special elections in deep-red House districts -- including the $30 million pumped into Jon Ossoff's  unsuccessful campaign in Georgia .  The Senate Majority PAC, the major Democratic super PAC focused on Senate races, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are still watching to see how the race develops before deciding whether to get involved -- keenly aware that Jones being seen as a candidate backed by the Democratic machine would be fatal in deep-red Alabama.    But Jones has attracted some support from Democrats and progressive activists who are eager to see the party put up a fight in the South, particularly against Moore, whose public persona is built in part on  his opposition to LGBT rights.  RELATED: Alabama senate candidate repeatedly appeared on radio with pastor who preaches penalty for homosexuality is death Jones was shepherded around Washington during a recent Congressional Black Caucus conference by Alabama's lone Democratic congresswoman, Terri Sewell, and consultant Joe Trippi. At a private lunch, Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland urged fellow Democrats to back Jones. His trip included meetings with progressive groups such as DailyKos.com -- the blog that injected rocket fuel into Ossoff's online fundraising efforts, but has not yet endorsed in the Alabama race.  Jones met with Democracy For America electoral director Annie Weinberg, and the group used its fundraising list to boost Jones this week.  \"Doug Jones took on the KKK and won. Roy Moore is a radical extremist who was kicked off the Alabama Supreme Court twice for his hateful views. We have to stop Roy Moore -- and support Doug Jones,\" DFA senior campaign manager Robert Cruickshank said in a fundraising email.  Another left-wing group, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, is railing against Moore -- but is taking the more cautious approach of urging donors to split their contributions among Jones, Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, two pro-LGBT bulwarks.   The Democratic National Committee has also sent fundraising emails on Jones' behalf, highlighting his career as a prosecutor who put two former Klansmen involved in the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing behind bars.  Jones also impressed Democrats -- and some Republicans -- with his first post-Republican primary interview with NBC's Chuck Todd.  But one progressive strategist said Jones is unlikely to come anywhere close to generating the donor interest that Ossoff received because his profile as a moderate Democrat won't excite progressive donors across the country who are looking for anti-Trump firebrands. It's not just Democrats who are tepid about the Alabama Senate race. The Bannon-aligned Great America PAC is asking if Mitch McConnell's super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, which spent more than $10 million backing Strange in the primary, is \"unwilling to spend as much to defeat a Democrat as they were willing to waste smearing a fellow Republican.\"  \"The best way for Mitch McConnell to atone for this mistake is for him and his allies at the Senate Leadership Fund to put their money where their mouth is and provide Judge Moore with the same level of financial support in the general election as they gave to Strange in last week's Republican runoff,\" Great America PAC strategist Ed Rollins said in a statement.  The Senate Leadership Fund declined to comment on the email blast. The super PAC said after Moore's primary victory that it would support him, but has not spent in the race yet, with the December 12 general election is still more than two months away. Moore was in Washington on Wednesday for meetings -- including a visit with Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist who has provided Washington muscle for anti-establishment Senate primaries, and a huddle in the Capitol Hill Club with the state's Republican congressional delegation. Bannon and Moore met for two hours.  Rep. Mo Brooks, the third-place finisher in Alabama's Republican primary behind Moore and Sen. Luther Strange, said afterward he was \"not going to discuss any of our strategies on helping make sure that Doug Jones, liberal Democrat, does not win.\"  But as of lunch time, the state's senior senator, Richard Shelby, still hadn't heard from Moore. The two hadn't spoken, he said, since Moore won the September 26 primary runoff against Sen. Luther Strange for the seat formerly held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  \"If he calls me, I'd be glad to meet with him,\" Shelby said.  \"I'm a Republican. I'm going to support the ticket. Roy Moore is the nominee,\" Shelby said. \"I think there will be other people on the ticket too. Local races. I don't know. I support them all.\" CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.

Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vermont, who joined most of his caucus on December 6 in urging Franken to step aside, said Monday that he wished he had waited until the Senate Ethics Committee moved forward with an investigation before expressing thoughts about Franken's future. \"I have stood for due process throughout my years as a prosecutor and in chairing the Judiciary Committee,\" Leahy said in a statement. \"I regret not doing that this time. The Ethics Committee should have been allowed to investigate and make its recommendation.\" Politico, which first reported that Leahy was privately regretting his earlier decision, reported that two other unnamed senators were wishing they hadn't joined in the calls for Franken's resignation. Also quoted in the story was Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who went on CNN's \"New Day\" later Monday morning to argue that Franken should have remained in the Senate and gone through an ethics review. \"I definitely think he should not resign,\" Manchin said. \"I think he should submit himself, which he has willingly done and offered to do, and go through this complete process of an extensive ethics review.\" Manchin added that Franken should pledge to abide by whatever the committee recommends. But most Senate Democrats weren't ready to jump on board with the idea of Franken reversing his decision. An aide to Franken said the senator is tying up loose ends and working on a smooth and speedy transition.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own.  (CNN) Donald Trump Jr.'s  decision  to take a meeting with a Russian lawyer who had alleged ties to the Kremlin may be the most baffling move by a high-level political operative in recent memory. Second only to his apparent thinking that such a meeting would be a good decision. The emails show -- and, by releasing them, Trump Jr. acknowledges -- that he agreed to meet someone he was told was a \"Russia government attorney,\" and someone who was alleged to have \"very high level and sensitive information\" to incriminate Hillary Clinton.   In short, the emails suggest he was prepared to meet with a potential agent of a hostile foreign government. And because he was joined by key campaign players Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort, we know this was no casual meeting. Why would Trump Jr. make these communications public? It seems that he was trying to beat the New York Times to the punch line, releasing the emails in the name of transparency -- a decision his father later praised.   Regardless, the President's son has shown astonishingly poor judgment. The email chain only makes this whole incident look more troubling. Earlier, Trump Jr. explained that  he had met  with the Russian lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya to discuss adoptions. Then  he claimed  he didn't know who he was meeting, adding that the she didn't offer dirt on Clinton -- as if that somehow made the meeting acceptable. Whether or not this might amount to treason, as Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia,  suggested , or whether it represents collusion, coordination, obstruction or any violation of the law are not the main issues. Instead, what should trouble the American people most is whether this incident will lead investigators to evidence that Trump acquiesced to and accepted help from Russia, based on the Kremlin's interference in the heart of America's democracy, its presidential elections. And if there is something beyond that. One of the most curious aspects of Trump's political campaign and his presidency has been his interest in reversing policy on Russia.  That became strikingly evident just one month after the meeting with Veselnitskaya, when Republican delegates met to draft  the platform  for the party's convention. Republicans had, until then, held strong positions regarding Russia's intervention in Ukraine and its illegal annexation of Crimea. It was Russia's 2014 invasion and seizure of the Crimean Peninsula, and Moscow's subsequent support for Ukrainian separatists fighting against the Ukrainian government, that prompted the United States to impose sanctions.  The Republican platform committee proposed language on the subject that would have been uncontroversial before Trump's success. But then, the Washington Post  reports , Manafort and Trump's delegates pushed back, orchestrating changes that deleted a call to provide arms to Ukraine to help it defend itself from Russian forces fighting on its territory. Other language, including increasing sanctions against Russia and noting that \"the post-Cold War ideal of a 'Europe whole and free' is being severely tested by Russia's military aggression,\"  disappeared , even though they represented the view of the Republican foreign policy establishment. That was one year ago. Now Trump is President and, according to senior officials in the White House, he's looking for ways  to ease  sanctions.  So is this definitive proof that Trump is paying Vladimir Putin back for what US intelligence officials say was a concerted effort by the Kremlin to help Trump win the election? No, it isn't. But it is one more piece of the puzzle in the curious relationship between the two world leaders. Relations with Russia are one area where Trump is pushing hard against both Republicans and Democrats. Just consider the bill  tightening sanctions  approved last month by a nearly unanimous Senate vote -- 98 to 2. The White House is now  pressuring  the House to water it down significantly before it becomes law.  Trump's dealings with Russia are a never-ending stream of controversy. He met in the Oval Office with the Russian foreign minister and the ambassador to the United States, giving them highly  classified information . As President, Trump has the authority to declassify any material he wishes to, but the move -- revealing information provided by an ally without the ally's permission -- was shocking. Critics  called it  \"reckless\" and \"dangerous.\" Trump has gone out on a thin limb,  risking charges  of obstruction of justice to protect Mike Flynn, who lost his White House job after lying about contacts with Russians. Half a dozen campaign aides  failed to disclose  contacts with Russia. And Attorney General Jeff Sessions initially  denied , under oath, meeting with the Russians. He  reversed course  when journalists uncovered evidence of his meeting with the Russian ambassador and then claimed the two had not discussed the campaign.  Trump is eager  to move forward  on cooperation with Russia, as we saw after his meeting with Putin in Hamburg, but the cloud hanging over his administration has so far prevented policy reversals. The fallout right now would be too great.   But if the investigations come to a close, Trump is likely to change policy. We now know that Russia did work to help Trump get elected. US intelligence agencies have \" high confidence \" in that, and the emails suggest it. We can also see that Trump is, in fact, trying to recast US policy in some areas beneficial to Putin. It happened during the Republican platform drafting, and it has continued during his presidency.   What we don't know, and the key to how this will unfold, is whether the latter is a consequence of the former. But if Trump Jr. continues trying to defend himself so ineptly, we may soon get the answers from him.","articles_date":"12 7 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/07\/11\/opinions\/trump-jr-russia-opinion-ghitis\/index.html","articles_title":"Donald Trump Jr. astonishes America","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":78,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Donald Trump's defenders have always argued that the entire notion his campaign colluded with Russia was all smoke and no fire. That may not cut it anymore. The President's son and namesake, in a sensational revelation that significantly escalated the drama over alleged Russian election meddling incessantly battering the White House, may have provided the flames by  releasing an email chain  that detailed his expectations of getting Kremlin dirt on Hillary Clinton in a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer last year. Donald Trump Jr.'s shocking move is more than another lurch in the storyline of alleged election interference that has utterly consumed American politics. The emails appear to add important context to the question at the center of the entire controversy: Was the Trump campaign willing to cooperate with Russia to use and highlight information damaging to the Democratic presidential nominee? What did the President know? What did his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, know? The documents revealed that Trump Jr. agreed to meet a \"Russian government attorney\" last summer after receiving an email offering him \"very high level and sensitive information\" that would \"incriminate\" Clinton. An email from  publicist Rob Goldstone  offered Trump Jr. a sit down that promised the handover of information as \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\" \"If it's what you say, I love it\" Trump Jr. replied. After months of innuendo, leaks and whispers over the Russia intrigue, the sight of inside information laid out in simple, conversational language in the email chain was shocking in itself. And the implications of those emails could rumble on for months. The emails, taken at face value, appear to show a willingness by Trump Jr., a vital member of his father's political and business inner circle, to accept information purportedly from the government of Russia to help his father's presidential campaign. Read the email exchange In an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News on Tuesday, Trump Jr. explained that he wanted to find out what the information was about. \"Maybe this is something,\" Trump Jr. said, adding that he thought, \"I should hear them out. ... This was again just basic information that was going to be possibly there. ... I wanted to hear them out and play it out.\" But he admitted, \"in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.\" The President came to the defense of his son in a tweet on Tuesday evening. \"He is a great person who loves our country!\" Trump wrote, after earlier releasing a statement praising Donald Trump Jr.'s transparency. The President did not however engage in the substance of the controversy. What happened in the meeting? It remains unknown what exactly went on in the meeting, though Trump Jr. has said the lawyer had no \"meaningful information\" to offer. But his intent in heading into the encounter last year is likely to interest congressional investigators and Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, has denied she was a Russian government employee, but the emails appear to reveal that Trump Jr. took the meeting on the assumption that she did at least have government connections. \"When it was suggested that I meet with Donald Trump Jr., I met him in a private situation. It was a private meeting, not related at all to the fact that he was the son of the candidate,\" Veselnitskaya told CNN's Matthew Chance. Arguments are already raging over the potential depth of Trump Jr.'s legal jeopardy. But Tuesday's developments also raise a string of political questions, which will dictate how much the latest disclosures punish the White House's already depleted political capital, and the President himself. Even the most charitable reading of the emails seems to lead to a conclusion that Trump Jr.'s decision to attend the meeting at all, and to get involved in an alleged international election intrigue, showed a staggering level of naivet\u00e9 that reveals the Trump campaign's lack of experience on the political stage. The least charitable interpretation adds up to a much more damaging legal and political nightmare for the White House. Changing story Tuesday's denials were also problematic for the President's son because they were the latest effort to clean up a story that had been evolving for three days, shredding his credibility by the hour. On Saturday, he said that the meeting had primarily focused on a frozen Russian adoption program.  The next day he said that Veselnitskaya had told him that individuals in Russia were supporting the Democratic National Committee and backing Clinton, but that her arguments were \"vague, ambiguous and made no sense.\" Then came Tuesday's email dump, as Trump Jr. apparently tried to get ahead of a story in the works by The New York Times using the same material. Collateral damage?  Trump Jr. is not the only presidential acolyte drawn into the storm by Tuesday's revelations. Both the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort took part in the meeting with the Russian lawyer, according to Trump Jr.'s statement on Sunday. It emerged Tuesday that both were cc:ed on a forwarded email telling them that the meeting would take place at 4 p.m. on June 9 last year in Trump Tower. It is unclear from the email exchange whether Kushner and Manafort also knew that the Russian lawyer was offering incriminating information on Clinton. Then, there is the ultimate question. How much did Trump know and when did he know it? The White House has insisted that he was in the dark. But the Trump team's story has changed so often during this furor that its own credibility has often been called into question. And the Trump campaign was one of the most tight-knit operations in presidential election history -- in which Trump's trusted grown children played outsize roles. Family ties On a personal level, the latest twist in the staggering Russia tale must be making life inside the West Wing for Trump and his family more fraught than ever, with the daily pounding of revelations now hitting the President's inner family circle, the place where he has always invested the greatest loyalty. Tuesday's bombshell also handed the White House an ever expanding political problem -- not just because Democrats seized on it to hammer the White House: Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said Trump Jr. may have committed \"treason\" -- though many legal experts would disagree. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer commented that Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer showed \"intent\" and that he must testify before Congress -- signaling a new Democratic attempt to call the administration to account through congressional committees, in addition to the special counsel probe by Mueller. The standard response from Trump aides throughout the entire span of the Russian intrigue has been that there's simply no there, there. \"No obstruction, no collusion, (fired FBI Chief James Comey's) a leaker,\" Trump said in a press conference in June. White House press secretary Sean Spicer often said the same thing. \"It's been very clearly stated on multiple occasions that there's no collusion that occurred, and yet this narrative continues to be perpetuated,\" said Spicer in May. The emails that were released by Trump Jr. on Tuesday may not totally undermine that line, as they are likely to form one piece of evidence in any cases assembled by congressional investigators or the special counsel.  But they certainly leave the viability of that defense, especially in a political sense, increasingly threadbare.","articles_date":"12 7 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/07\/11\/politics\/trump-jr-russia-politics\/index.html","articles_title":"Donald Trump Jr.'s emails undermine what the White House has been saying ","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":79,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) On Monday night, President Donald Trump endorsed Mitt Romney's Utah Senate candidacy. He did so, of course,  via Twitter : \".@MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah. He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement!\" Romney, who is an overwhelming favorite to fill the seat of retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch,  quickly responded in kind :  \"Thank you Mr. President for the support. I hope that over the course of the campaign I also earn the support and endorsement of the people of Utah.\" Well, isn't that special! Here's the thing: That exchange of tweets is exactly why people hate politics and, I hate to say it, why that hatred is justified. What we know about Donald Trump is that he doesn't like Mitt Romney. What we know about Mitt Romney is that he doesn't like Donald Trump.  Here's a brief walk down memory lane for the two men. Back in February 2016, Romney said on Fox News, \"We have good reason to believe that there's a bombshell in Donald Trump's taxes.\" Trump responded on Twitter : \"Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!\" Romney responded to that tweet with  another tweet : \"Methinks the Donald doth protest too much. Show voters your back taxes, @realDonaldTrump. #WhatIsHeHiding.\" The following month, Romney upped the ante with a speech that functioned as a point-by-point rejection of Trump and Trumpism.  He said , in part: \"Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat.\" Trump, of course, didn't let that attack go unanswered. Of Romney's 2012 presidential bid , Trump said at a campaign rally in Maine : \"He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees.' He would have dropped to his knees.\" So, that happened. Romney voted for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in Utah's presidential primary. In the summer of 2016, he said he wouldn't vote for either Trump or Hillary Clinton in November. \"It's a matter of personal conscience,\"  Romney said at the time . \"I can't vote for either of those two people.\"  Then came the  super-weird float of Romney as a potential secretary of state nominee for Trump . In retrospect, that seems largely like a feint by Trump -- although  it did give the Internet one of its great photos . Ever. And now, this. Trump offering a full-throated endorsement of Romney and Romney accepting it. The \"why\" is obvious -- on both ends. For Trump, he sees that Romney has no serious primary challenge and is about as close to a sure thing to win in the fall as you will find in an open-seat Senate race. Trump, as you may have picked up on, likes winners -- and being associated with winning. Now, when Romney likely wins, Trump can take credit. In endorsing Romney, Trump also plays nice with Hatch and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both of whom urged him to back Romney. For Romney,  like Adam Sandler's goat , his options are pretty much limited here. Reject Trump's endorsement in any sort of public manner and run the risk of Trump savaging you on Twitter and working to find someone to run against you. Ignore the endorsement and watch as you are asked what you think of Trump at every single campaign appearance until you decide you have to answer the question somehow. I get it. But it doesn't make the whole thing any less unsavory. These are two people who don't like each other. Their personalities, their lives, their beliefs are all polar opposites.  As the Boston Globe's Scott Helman told me last week , \"The Romney ethos could hardly diverge more from the Trump ethos, especially in terms of character and temperament.\" Which is totally fine! Not everyone we meet in our lives is destined to be our best friend. Or our friend at all. (In fact, I subscribe to the  Chuck Klosterman theory that we all need a good  villain.) Politicians do best when they act like normal people. They do worst when they pretend as though they are emotionless robots. No person, not one, thinks Romney and Trump can stand one another.

Hillary Clinton's defeat was stunning enough. But the fact that she lost to Donald Trump led Democrats to question whether they had fundamentally misread the American public, and whether their party and its message needed a total overhaul. Then Trump actually became president. Suddenly Democrats' gloom lifted -- even as Trump's poll numbers sagged. And candidates willing to take Trump on began to emerge -- more like pour -- out of the woodwork.  As  Karen Tumulty writes in a piece in the Washington Post today :  \"Presidential buzz seems to be building around an unusually large and varied group of Democrats and famous names from outside of politics -- a parlor game that includes pretty much every current Democratic senator and governor, mayors and House members, barons of the business world and, of course, the occasional wild-card celebrity. The Hill newspaper recently tallied 43 people who might run against Donald Trump.\" 43 people! Now, simply because lots and lots of candidates are considering the race doesn't mean Democrats have solved all of the problems the 2016 campaign exposed. Democrats still have to litigate out whether it's Joe Biden's party or Elizabeth Warren's party going forward. And there are lots and lots voices who want to have a say in that debate. But what Trump's performance in office has done is give Democrats' hope. And, in the immortal words of Andy Dufresne: \" Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies .\" Here's my updated look at where the 2020 field stands today. The candidates are listed alphabetically within their respective tiers. For the purposes of this piece, I am taking people at their word if they say they aren't running. So, you won't find  Mark Zuckerberg  or  John Hickenlooper  or  Kirsten Gillibrand  or  Sheryl Sandberg  on this list. Don't see your favorite candidate? Never fear! There's still (lots of) time! 1st Tier (If they run, they have a real chance to win the nomination) Joe Biden Uncle Joe put any chatter that he's not thinking about running in 2020 to rest over the last few weeks.  Opening a PAC  to sprinkle money around to candidates -- and fund his own travel to key states -- is the leading edge of an effort to ensure Biden is at the front of the line, and has the right of first refusal. He's got that for now. Bernie Sanders \"He hasn't made up his mind,\" former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told Tumulty of the Vermont independent. \"He's open to it.\" Got it. Elizabeth Warren Warren, more so -- to my mind -- than Sanders, is the face of liberals nationally. I don't think that means Sanders would stand down for Warren, but it's hard to see how the top tier could fit both of them. 2nd Tier (Have potential to be a major contender but not there ... yet) Cory Booker In the first kind of, sort of 2020 candidate cattle call last month at the Center for American Progress, the New Jersey Senator was given the closing, keynote spot. ( You can watch his speech here .)  That elevated role speaks to his status as the brightest, youngest star in the current Democratic firmament. And  Booker's latest response to the possibility of a 2020 bid  leaves some wiggle room: \"I always say I'm running from the president, not to the president right now. I don't know what the future holds, but at this time in my life, I want to be a fierce truth teller. Let's not focus on 2020; let's work on the injustices that exist now.\" Andrew Cuomo The New York governor is preparing to run for a third term next November -- New York doesn't have gubernatorial term limits -- but continues to entertain the possibility of a presidential bid in 2020. \"We need to win back the middle class while pushing progressive values,\" said  Cuomo , sounding entirely like a presidential wannabe during a visit to DC in February for a National Governors Association meeting.  Al Franken Buzz around the possibility of a bid by the comedian-turned-senator is growing  -- particularly as he moves around the country promoting his new book. Franken's appeal? He is Trump's equal (at least) as a performer, but also has a solid policy core. Kamala Harris The newly-elected California Senator insists she isn't spending any time thinking about the possibility of a 2020 bid. But she did make time in her calendar to speak at the CAP cattle call last month. In her speech, she focused on criminal justice reform,  noting : \"There's a real opportunity to reach parts of America that feel overlooked and don't realize how much they have in common with people who look very different.\" Tim Kaine It remains to be seen whether Democrats in 2020 want to totally and completely move on from what happened in 2016. If they do, Kaine, who shared the ticket with Clinton, will have a hard time. If not, however, lots of the things that made him attractive as a VP -- governor and senator of a swing state, bilingual, etc. -- would also make him an appealing presidential candidate. Terry McAuliffe McAuliffe is bumping up hard against Virginia's one-term limit. He'll be out of office in early 2018 and is looking for something to do. And, unlike most of the people on this list, the Macker isn't pretending he doesn't want it. \"I'd like to be Tom Brady's backup quarterback, I'd like to be the Pope too in the future,\"  he told ABC in late March . \"You know my personality, go big or go home.\" Chris Murphy The Connecticut Senator won't have room to run if Sanders and\/or Warren do. But, if they don't -- and neither is a sure thing -- he could well slot into the leading liberal role, given his outspokenness on gun control in the wake of Newtown and, more recently, his vocal opposition to the Trump presidency. 3rd Tier (It's not IM-possible) Steve Bullock Bullock was in Washington last month for the CAP cattle call . Which means he wants to be part of the great mentioned. The issue for Bullock? Money. How does he raise enough to compete with already-better-known people in tiers above him? Eric Garcetti The Los Angeles Mayor wants to run for something in the next few years. The governor's race is open in 2018 and there continue to be some whispers that Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) isn't a sure thing to run for reelection next November either.  But it sure seems like Garcetti has his eye on a run for president. Not only did he speak at the CAP conference, but  he also gave a very vague answer to Politico  -- \"I'm not focused on running for president\" -- when asked about 2020. Jay Inslee I've moved the Washington governor down a tier from the last ranking I did because there continues to be no obvious movement -- behind some allies in Washington pushing his name -- that would suggest Inslee is actually interested in the race. I still think Inslee is an interesting profile, however, and  he continues to go after Trump hard . Amy Klobuchar The Minnesota Senator has a Franken problem. Her home-state colleague is buzzier right now. Of course, it's a very long time until anyone votes, and  Klobuchar is already aggressively stumping like a 2020er . Mitch Landrieu Landrieu's speech on the removal of several status of Confederate generals in his hometown of New Orleans  was terrific -- and rightly won him considerable national attention. But, it's still tough to run for  president as a sitting mayor of New Orleans. Seth Moulton Moulton is one of the young up-and-coming Democrats in the House. But, that's probably where he'll stay for now. Martin O'Malley The former Maryland governor isn't giving up the dream of being president just yet.  He's been back to New Hampshire ,  conducted a poll in Iowa  and has been  one of the most high-profile pols supporting Archie Parnell's long-shot bid in South Carolina's 5th district . Those are not the actions of someone who is done with all of this.  Tier-less (Rich businesspeople who've never run for anything before) Mark Cuban The Dallas Mavericks owner is playing it coy, sort of, when it comes to the possibility of running for president. \"None. None,\"  he told the Washington Post  about his interest, before adding: \"But at the same time, sometimes you got to do what you got to do.\" I mean... Howard Schultz The Starbucks founder is clearly interested in doing more in public life. In fact,  he considered running for president in 2016 against Clinton . (I did not know that!) His interest in elected office coupled with a rags-to-riches life story and an estimated net worth in the billions makes Schultz intriguing.","articles_date":"6 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/06\/politics\/2020-democrats-trump\/index.html","articles_title":"Donald Trump is the best 2020 recruiter Democrats could hope for","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":81,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"ADVERTISEMENT : Hi, I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight. Let's get straight to our top story: Donald Trump versus Ted Cruz. Both sides are unleashing vicious broad sides against each other with their attacks escalating over the past few days.  I have never seen anybody that lied as much as Ted Cruz. He is a lying guy -- a really lying guy. Some people misrepresent, this guy is just a plain out liar.  Truth matters. You cannot simply scream \"liar\" when somebody points out the actual position of Donald Trump. So I will continue to focus on substance and truth and let other candidates focus on the insults and attack.  And the Cruz campaign isn't stopping there. Releasing a fresh attack ad, taking aim at Donald Trump. : Between sips of wine and bites of salad, a Planned Parenthood doctor discusses getting money for tissue from aborted fetuses.  Harvesting the organs of aborted fetuses for money. Planned Parenthood treats the unborn like another form of currency. And yet, some politicians still defend them. T  Planned Parenthood serves a good function. We have to look at the positives. : Donald Trump is just plain wrong. And Trump fired back today. This guy, Cruz, comes out. Well I don't think he is going to win. This guy is so strident and so nasty he is going to lose every single state. : Well this battle between Trump and Cruz isn't costing Trump support, at least not yet. A new survey by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic group shows Trump maintaining a strong lead in South Carolina with 35 percent of likely Republican voters backing him. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are tied for second at 18 percent, followed by John Kasich at 10 percent then Jeb Bush and Ben Carson tied at 7 percent. Joining us now with reaction from Columbia, South Carolina Alice Stewart, senior adviser for the Cruz campaign; and from Dallas Trump national spokesperson Katrina Pierson. Now, Katrina and Alice, no two better people sitting right here to debate all recent events between your two candidates. I'm going to start with you Katrina. Donald has said Ted Cruz has repeatedly lied about him and is ready to sue. Is that the case? Will Trump sue Cruz for libel?  Well, he actually might, considering how a lot of these attacks against Mr. Trump are not true. And specifically with this new ad on Planned Parenthood, Donald Trump simply says that cervical cancer screening for poor women is a good thing, even though he opposes abortion and opposes funding for abortion for Planned. The Cruz campaign wants to take it a little bit further. It's obvious that Senator Cruz needs South Carolina to move forward and he is not going to stop at anything, including misrepresenting his positions on pretty much everything at this point -- Eric. Ok. Alice, is Ted Cruz concerned about being sued in the middle of a fight for the GOP nomination? : Well, if Donald Trump wants to sue, bring it on. The fact of the matter is Ted Cruz has done nothing but point out Donald Trump's exact words, exactly as he said them. And he has said that he supports the nation's largest abortion provider. He has said he is pro-choice. He has said that Planned Parenthood does some great things. And so -- I want to ask Katrina, the nation's largest abortion provider, how can he compete in a state like South Carolina when he supports abortion? : Katrina. : Well, first, I would like to ask Alice if she actually believes Mr. Trump supports abortion because the ads that the campaign are running are from 17 years ago. Mr. Trump hasn't been pro-abortion for a very long time. He has been pro-life. He has told stories on the campaign trail about that transition. Senator Cruz props up people like Ronald Reagan who, as governor of California, signed the most liberal piece of abortion legislation in that state, in the country's history, Alice. Mr. Trump is pro-life and the Cruz campaign knows it.  Alice. Well, it was just last week when we were on the debate stage when Donald Trump said that he supports taxpayer funding for the nation's largest abortion provider. We are talking last week not 17 years ago. He has said repeatedly that he is -- Mr. Trump said he supports the good things, the good things like cervical. Do you think poor women shouldn't have cervical cancer screenings?  Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion provider. He supports the nation's largest abortion provider and South Carolina is a pro-life state. The Republican Party is a pro-life party. And you cannot go around saying that you are pro-life when you support funding for Planned Parenthood. In addition to that he has said repeatedly that he thinks they do good things. He has also said he supported Democrat candidates over the years. : He also supported Ted Cruz. He's donated to Ted Cruz.  Hold on guys. We can go back and forth on this. I mean Alice, honestly, there are a lot of candidates who change positions on certain things, for example on immigration. Some would say Ted Cruz has changed his position on immigration over the years as well. Should you be holding Donald Trump to the standard of what he said as Katrina points out -- I'm not sure about that 17 years ago number. If, in fact, it was 17 years ago that he said it, should he be held to that standard now? : He should be held to the standard of what he said on the debate stage just last week, Eric. That's what people are basing their decision on. And when it comes to immigration, no one has fought harder against Marco Rubio and the Gang of Eight and their amnesty program than Ted Cruz in Washington, D.C. Here's the fact. I'm in South Carolina. We have been out on the campaign trail for days here in South Carolina talking to South Carolinians about issues that they are concerned with. Not some Donald Trump just calling his opponents liars and nasty. Ted Cruz this morning gave a phenomenal national security speech here in Charleston where he talked about the importance of funding and building up our military. Barack Obama has spent the past seven years with our national security on the back burner. Ted Cruz will put it on the front burner. This afternoon, we were out on the campaign trail with Texas governor, former governor Rick Perry and Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Myer. Talking about our vets --  Katrina, now -- : Donald Trump is pro-life and has been for a very long time. We too are on the ground in South Carolina listening to the voters who think that a lot of these things that the Cruz campaign are too doing have very sleazy from Iowa all the way to South Carolina with these horrible push polls. I will say this with regard to immigration. Donald Trump is the most solid on immigration as we have seen and the only reason we are having this discussion is because of Donald Trump. On Senator Cruz's own YouTube page, he is praising bringing Syrian refugees to this country because it's the right thing to do for America. He flip-flopped on that after Mr. Trump came out against it. He supported increasing HB1 visas and green cards.  Right. We can't go through the complete platforms of both candidates. What I would like to talk about a little bit and we don't have a ton of time. I'm going to start with you Katrina, in the aftermath of the last debate where Donald Trump had mentioned some things about George W. Bush yet afterwards the poll numbers haven't seem to have budged. Is he concerned -- are you hearing on the ground that that's going to affect anything going forward going into Saturday's primary?  No. Not at all, Eric. The people on the ground in South Carolina and all over the country are tired of the transnational corporations backed people like Senator Ted Cruz who promotes Obama trade. They are tired of it. They want their jobs back. They want to make things in this country again. They want to secure the borders. They want to stop immigration. They want to deport criminal aliens. The people on the ground get it. They are very used to politics and politic politicians alike and that's why we see the poll numbers staying the same. : And what do you say Alice. Is Ted Cruz concerned that the poll numbers in the aftermath of the -- what a lot of people thought this was the one thing that's going to give Donald Trump his numbers to come down after all the other things. This was going to be the one because George W. Bush seems to be beloved, but it hasn't seemed to budge. Is Ted Cruz concerned that maybe he shouldn't have picked this fight? Well, here's the thing. Ted Cruz has done nothing more than point out Donald Trump's own record and his own words. And for -- it's sad that Katrina has to defend someone who basically says anyone that calls out his record is lying. That's a pretty weak defense. And just by saying someone is a liar does not address the issue. So, you know, it's unfortunate.  Here is where the rubber meets the road. You look at the last poll, the poll we just sited Ted Cruz was solidly in second prior to that poll. Now he is tied for second. His numbers have slid a bit. Is this a concern in the Cruz camp?  We are encouraged by the crowds we've seen here on the ground in South Carolina. We are making tens of thousands of phone calls every day and knocking on doors and having tremendous surrogates out here on the trail with us. And keep in mind, the polls have Donald Trump in first in Iowa and we had a resounding victory in Iowa. We are looking forward to Saturday. We're going to have to leave it right there, ladies. Thank you very much. Hot debate.","articles_date":"17 02 2016","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/transcript\/2016\/02\/17\/donald-trump-vs-ted-cruz.html","articles_title":"Donald Trump vs. Ted Cruz","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":82,"issue":8,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump sat for an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. While the interview was quickly eclipsed by Trump's comment that immigrants were coming from \"shithole countries,\" it is still a very interesting read. I went through the  transcript  -- helpfully released by the Journal (kudos!) -- and picked out the 56 most noteworthy lines. They're below. 1. \"We were going down, we were going down a long way.\" This is Trump's description of the end of the Obama presidency. And off we go! 2. \"The cutting of regulation and all of the many things that we've done, including being a cheerleader for the country -- and perhaps that's part of the reason I'm going to Davos also -- but being a cheerleader for the country.\" An interesting comment by Trump -- and telling. He quite clearly puts considerable stock in the idea that the president must be a cheerleader. It reminds me of a  story from The New York Times  that suggested Donald Trump Jr. approached Ohio Gov. John Kasich with an offer to be vice president -- and a wide-ranging portfolio of responsibilities. What would the elder Trump be in charge of, Kasich asked? \"Making America Great Again\" was Don Jr.'s response. 3. \"You people actually wrote one of the best stories that I've ever seen on regulation; you said more than any president in history. That was the full pager, that wasn't...\" Your regular reminder that Trump is a VERY active consumer of the very same mainstream media he decries. Also , this is the \"full pager\"  (I think) that Trump refers to. 4. \"I mean I actually read it because I've never seen a full page\u2014it's actually a full page article.\" So, he read it  because  it was a full-page article? 5. \"One of the promises that you know is being very seriously negotiated right now is the wall and the wall will happen.\" Well, if you say so.... 6. \"If we don't make a fair deal for this country, a Trump deal, then we're not going to have\u2014then we're going to have a\u2014I will terminate.\" A \"Trump deal\"! Epic! 7. \"They've done more for me than they ever have for any American president.\"  This is Trump on China and Trump on massive hyperbole. Everything must be historic or record-setting or the best or the first. 8. \"He's \u2014 China has done far more for us than they ever have for any American president.\" This is not a duplicate. He just said virtually the same thing again a sentence or two later. 9. \"This should not have been a problem left on my desk, but it is, and I get things solved. And one way or the other, that problem is going to be solved.\" This Trump assertion on North Korea is, um, muscular? \"That problem is going to be solved\" is pretty definitive. 10. \"But the difference is I'm president; other people aren't.\" Fact Check: True! 11. \"And I know more about wedges than any human being that's ever lived, but I'll let you know.\" OK, so the context here is that the Journal reporters are asking whether North Korea is trying to drive a wedge between South Korea and the United States. is Trump talking about that kind of wedge or a pitching wedge in golf? I genuinely have no idea, but I can tell you that either way he knows more about it than \"any human being that's ever lived.\" 12. \"I have a great relationship with him, as you know I have a great relationship with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.\" One of these things is not like the other... 13. \"I don't want to comment on it\u2014I don't want to comment, I'm not saying I have or I haven't.\" Trump on whether he has spoken to Kim Jong Un. (HINT:  He hasn't .) 14. \"Sure, you see that a lot with me and then all of a sudden somebody's my best friend. I could give you 20 examples. You give me 30. I'm a very flexible person.\" He's right about this. Ted Cruz. Rand Paul. Bob Corker. Lindsey Graham. Trump has SAVAGED all of these people and yet has somehow managed to build relationships with them after the clash. 15. \"Unless it's somebody that didn't love our country, and the Democrats love our country. We have different views but the Democrats love our country.\" Trump is talking specifically about the visa lottery system and chain migration here.  And it speaks volumes that he says that if you don't agree with his view on these two topics, you must not love America. 16. \"I've also said Mexico's got to pay for it\u2014sometimes you know on occasion, I'd add who's going to pay for it? Mexico. Well they will pay for it, OK?\" Go on... 17. \"You know, we make a good deal on NAFTA, say I'm going to take a small percentage of that money and it's going to go toward the wall. Guess what? Mexico's paying.\" OK, so to follow Trump's logic: The US re-negotiates NAFTA. In that renegotiation, the US saves money in the deal. That money, which comes from Mexico(?), pays for the wall? 18. \"There is no deal that I can make on NAFTA that's as good as if I terminate NAFTA and make a new  deal.\" And yet, Trump repeatedly says in this interview he is open to re-negotiating NAFTA. 19. \"We have mountains that are far better than a wall, we have violent rivers that nobody goes near.\" The most violent rivers, believe me. 20. \"I saw on television, Donald Trump is going to make the wall smaller; no, the wall's identical.\" \"Believe it or not, even when I'm in Washington or New York, I do not watch much television\/ People that don't know me, they like to say I watch television -- people with fake sources. You know, fake reporters, fake sources.\" --  Donald Trump, November 11, 2017 21. \"You go 32 feet up and you don't know who's over here. You're here, you've got the wall and there's some other people here.\" [nodding] 22. \"If I'm standing here, I want to be able to see 200 yards out. I want to be able to see, I don't want to have a piece of concrete that I can't see.\" [keeps nodding] 23. \"We have to have vision through the wall.\" Wall vision is key. 24. \"I'd like to be able to see three or four hundred yards instead of we're at a wall we have no idea who's on the other side. Does this make sense or am I just wasting my time?\" [nods vigorously] 25. \"I have Foxconn coming to Wisconsin; that's my deal. You know the head of Foxconn, you know he's a friend of mine. He's still only moving there because of me.\" Paging Scott Walker. Governor Walker, please pick up the nearest white phone. 26. \"The wall is the wall and it's the same wall that we're always talking about.\" Look. All in all, we're just another brick in the wall. 27. \"We don't need it where you have mountains; you don't need it where you have rivers and -- you know, vicious rivers.\" Wait, wait. I thought the rivers were \"violent?\" 28. \"Yeah, be really clear, I'd like to -- because I love the 'Wall Street Journal'. I hope that you guys are clear. OK.\" Same. 29. \"The man with the three hour interview, he spent three hours -- the man who said he spent three hours in the Oval Office who I never met once in the White House.\" \"The man with the three hour interview\" is kind of a catchy nickname for Michael Wolff. 30. \"I think that when somebody makes false statements and libelous statements, whether it's in a book or a newspaper or anything else. When they have phony sources, when the sources don't exist, yeah I think they should have a liability.\" Cough. Throat clear. Cough. Ahem. 31. \"I was always the best at what I did, I was the -- I was, you know, I went to the -- I went to the Wharton School of Finance, did well.\" This is, by the way, Trump's explanation for why the media doesn't like him. Also, he went to Wharton. That's at the University of Pennsylvania. Ivy League and whatnot. 32. \"I created maybe the greatest brand.\" \"Maybe\" the greatest brand??? Sad! 33. \"Just -- and so -- so I was successful, successful, successful.\" That's three \"successfuls,\" which, by anyone's reckoning, is a lot of success. 34. \"I was always the best athlete, people don't know that.\" No words. 35. \"And then people say oh, is he a smart person? I'm smarter than all of them put together, but they can't admit it.\" Best brand? CHECK Best brain? CHECK Best athlete? ALSO CHECK 36. \"I have many people that work for me who were far more important than Steve, right there.\" This is a very debatable claim. Bannon was the chief architect of Trump's policy vision and, by all accounts, the one voice urging him to stay in the race after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape. 37. \"And Steve, in the end I fired Steve.\" He did!  38. \"I don't know what the word permanent means, OK?\" He does! What Trump means here is that he never severs any relationship permanently. People can always come back into the Trump fold -- and often do. 39. \"We'll see what happens, but Steve had nothing to do with my win. Well, certainly very little.\" Provably false. 40. \"Steve's greatest asset is he was able to convince a corrupt media that he was responsible for my win.\" Oh so  that  was Bannon's greatest gift. 41. \"I talked to Steve very little; I didn't know Steve well, believe it or not.\" I don't believe it because it's not true. Bannon and Trump had known one another since 2011. 42. \"My son had a brief meeting based on the fact that he thought whatever he thought.\" We know that Don Jr. met with Russians at Trump Tower because he had been promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. 43. \"It's probably illegal, what he's doing.\" Trump accuses California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of breaking the law for leaking (I think?). 44. \"Because they realize there's no collusion whatsoever. There's no collusion.\" No. Collusion. 46. \"I won an election that should never be won, because the Electoral College is far harder to win than the popular vote. The popular vote, for me, would have been much easier.\" The 2016 election ended 429 days ago. 47. \"This is the FBI we're talking about. I think that is -- that is treason. See, that's treason right there.\" Trump's argument -- in case you are missing it -- is that  the FBI officials texting negative things about him during the 2016 campaign was treason . 48. \"By the way, that's a treasonous act. What he tweeted to his lover is a treasonous act.\" Yes, you just said that. 49. \"There has never been, in the history -- in the history of an administration anybody that was more open than we were.\" Uh... 50. \"Everybody hated Comey.\" I smell a sitcom.... 51. \"I've been, you know, pretty successful in the courts over the years, I've been a very successful person, you can check -- USA Today said, 'he does great in the courts' OK?\" Best brand? CHECK Best brain? CHECK Best athlete? ALSO CHECK Best in court? WHAT DO YOU THINK? CHECK. 52. \"When he announced the Hillary Clinton fiasco where she was guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty and then where they did the interview with no tape recorder, with no swearing in, with no this, with no that -- you know the story.\" Four \"guiltys\"!  That's bigger than three \"successfuls.\" Trust me. I know math. 53. \"I do enjoy this, actually.\" Trump is talking about being interviewed. And of course he enjoys it. He loves the media no natter what he says publicly. 54. \"I've knocked out ISIS and Syria and Iraq and all but -- and we're doing well in Afghanistan for the first time ever.\" \"I've knocked out.\" 55. \"Our air-traffic control is from a different planet.\" Tell me more.... 56. \"You know what? I like him. I like him. I like them all.\" I like him too. I like them all -- whoever them all is.","articles_date":"12 1 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/01\/12\/politics\/trump-wsj-interview\/index.html","articles_title":"Donald Trump's 56 most unforgettable lines from his Wall Street Journal interview","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":83,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Donald Trump's tweet Thursday attacking MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski is just the latest in a long line of disparaging jabs he has hurled at prominent women. The President referred to Brzezinski as \"low I.Q. Crazy Mika\" and said she was \"bleeding badly from a face-lift\" when she came to visit him around New Year's Eve. His tweet, which drew swift and  widespread  condemnation, fits into a larger pattern for Trump, who has a history of viciously going after women's appearances and mental health. During the campaign, he called then-Fox anchor Megyn Kelly \"crazy\" and described her during the first GOP presidential debate as having \"blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\"He also tweeted out an unflattering photo of Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, and threatened to \"spill the beans\" about her without explaining what that meant. But his pattern of behavior was put on its most public display years before he campaigned for president.  During his long-running feud with comedian Rosie O'Donnell in the mid-2000s, Trump repeatedly ridiculed O'Donnell for her weight and once even attacked her for her struggle with depression.  \"She announced last week that she suffers from depression,\" Trump told  an  audience at the Learning Annex in 2007. \"They called me for a comment, and rather than saying 'I have no comment' or 'isn't that too bad oh, that's so bad,' I said, 'I think I can cure her depression,' \u2014 most of you heard this. 'If she stopped looking in the mirror, I think she'd stop being so depressed.'\"  In the same speech, Trump  said  it was \"politically correct bullshit\" that people would not call O'Donnell fat. \"This slob, now I'm not allowed to use the word fat. They say, 'he used the fat word.' I know much worse words,\" he said.  \"It's funny, I called her a degenerate, I called her the worst things, nobody cared.\" He added, \"But I go on the Today Show and Meredith Vieira, 'Donald is it true?' -- this is like two weeks ago I was supposed to talking about The Apprentice. She said, 'Is it true that you called Rosie crude?' I said, 'no, I called her a degenerate. I didn't call her crude, it's not strong enough.' She goes, 'But did you call her fat?' I said, 'Let me ask you a question Meredith. Is she fat?' 'I'd rather not comment.' Can you believe this bullshit? This is politically correct bullshit, OK?\" O'Donnell  would  go on to describe Trump's attacks on her as \"the most bullying I ever experienced in my life,\" telling People magazine in 2014: \"It was national, and it was sanctioned societally. Whether I deserved it is up to your own interpretation.\" Over the years, Trump would make some of his most disparaging comments about women on  \"The Howard Stern Show.\"  Discussing actress Nicollette Sheridan in 2005, Trump said, \"A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10.\" He also attacked model-turned-reality TV star Anna Nicole Smith's lips days in a 2007 episode after her death, saying, \"It is the most disgusting thing to look at these big fat pumped up tires.\"  On Twitter, Trump has lashed out at media executive Arianna Huffington,  tweeting  in 2012, \".@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.\" In 2015, he hit her again,  tweeting , \"How much money is the extremely unattractive (both inside and out) Arianna Huffington paying her poor ex-hubby for the use of his name?\" In 2012, also on Twitter, Trump  went after singer Cher,  writing , \".@cher--I don't wear a 'rug'\u2014it's mine. And I promise not to talk about your massive plastic surgeries that didn't work.\" Trump also  said  it was a double standard that actress Bette Midler could talk about his hair, but he couldn't attack her \"ugly face or body.\"  \".@BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't. Is this a double standard?\" he asked on Twitter in 2012. \"While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct,\" he  added  in another tweet. And when he was live-tweeting the Oscars in 2014, Trump  said  of Kim Novak, \"I'm having a real hard time watching the Academy Awards (so far). The last song was terrible! Kim should sue her plastic surgeon! #Oscars\" Novak said the tweet devastated her.  Trump later expressed regret for the comment, and tweeted: \"I was always a big fan of Kim Novak and still am\u2014a wonderful actress.\"","articles_date":"29 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/29\/politics\/kfile-trump-long-history-disparaging-comments\/index.html","articles_title":"Donald Trump's long history of disparaging women's appearances ","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":84,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Want the latest climate news in your inbox?

CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 The Environmental Protection Agency convened a public hearing on Tuesday on its plan to roll back the signature climate change rule of the Obama administration. More than 270 people signed up to speak. The regulation, known as  Clean Power Plan , would require states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, particularly those that burn coal. The plan, finalized in 2015, would have accelerated a shift already underway from coal-generated power to natural gas and renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. The proposal sparked a bitter fight from coal interests and from many conservative state officials. The former Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, was one of the officials in 29 states who filed a lawsuit to fight the plan. President Trump named Mr. Pruitt head of the E.P.A., where he has made it a top priority to reverse what he has called the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt, like many other administration officials, question the overwhelming scientific evidence that climate change is mainly caused by human activity \u2014 a conclusion repeated this month  by the government\u2019s own scientists  in 13 federal agencies. As part of a broad effort to uproot the environmental policies of the Obama administration, Mr. Pruitt announced in October that he would kill the Clean Power Plan, which he said did not follow regulatory norms and imposed undue burdens on states and energy producers. Tuesday\u2019s public hearing was a required part of undoing the regulation. Mr. Pruitt did not attend. Holding the hearing in West Virginia \u201cis like holding the only hearing on financial deregulation at the Wall Street Hilton \u2014 it does not denote a keen interest in alternative views,\u201d  Michael B. Gerrard , the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said in an interview last week. So many people  requested time to speak  that they were spread out over three meeting rooms in the state capitol during the two days set aside for the hearing. During the morning hearing,  Patrick Morrisey , the attorney general of West Virginia, led off the speakers, saying that the power plan \u201cis not only unlawful, but it\u2019s bad policy as well.\u201d He led the coalition of states that sued to stop the power plan. The  Supreme Court in February delayed  enforcement of the regulation. (In similar fashion, a number of Democratic state attorneys general, including  Maura Healey  of Massachusetts and  Eric T. Schneiderman  of New York, have pledged to fight the repeal in court.) Robert E. Murray , founder and president of Murray Energy, a major coal producer, exulted, \u201cIn President Trump, we finally have a president who has vowed to preserve coal jobs.\u201d The Obama administration\u2019s rule, which he called the \u201cso-called and illegal Clean Power Plan, better known as the no-power plan,\u201d would impose \u201cmassive costs on the power sector and American consumers\u201d while eliminating even more coal jobs. Before the hearing began, Mr. Murray warmly greeted dozens of miners whom his company brought in by bus for the event. \u201cYou all know you have to work the afternoon shift now,\u201d he joked. Several groups are also holding an alternate hearing across the Kanawha River, at the University of Charleston, to discuss the environmental, health and climate benefits of reducing coal consumption. \u201cThe Clean Power Plan has a lot of support,\u201d said Bill Price, a local organizer for the Sierra Club who grew up in the area and whose father worked in the coal mines. Since the shift to power sources like solar and wind create jobs and clean the environment, he said, the Clean Power Plan is \u201cpro-worker, pro-economy and it\u2019s pro-environment.\u201d Some of the speakers marveled at the turnaround on environmental regulation that a change in administrations had wrought. Speaking in favor of repeal,  Bill Raney , president of the West Virginia Coal Association said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we have ever testified in favor of anything the E.P.A. has ever done.\u201d Opponents of repeal attending the hearing offered rebuttal.  Jim Probst , West Virginia coordinator for Citizens Climate Lobby, said that he was speaking with future generations in mind, and said that it was wrong to blame regulations for coal\u2019s woes. \u201cThe reality is that  the coal industry has been in decline for many years .\u201d Liz Perera , climate policy director of the Sierra Club, testified that the Trump administration had \u201cinappropriately  cooked the books \u201d on the costs and benefits of the plan. \u201cThis is about the kind of world we will leave for our children,\u201d she said. Stanley Sturgill , a retired Kentucky coal miner who has become an activist, started out at 3 a.m. to get to the hearing. Now 71 and afflicted with black lung and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, he called repealing the plan \u201cimmoral and indefensible.\u201d He repeated a comment he gave in support of the plan in 2014: \u201cWe\u2019re dying, literally dying, for you to help us.\u201d Coal-fired power plants are a major source of greenhouse gases: they produce  about one-third  of the nation\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions. This is the sole hearing scheduled on repealing the plan; the Obama administration held four such hearings in creating it. A spokesman for the E.P.A. said, \u201cWe continue to assess the needs for additional hearings, and in the meantime encourage all stakeholders to submit their comments to the public docket, which will be open until January 16, 2018.\u201d","articles_date":"28 11 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/11\/28\/climate\/epa-repeal-obama-climate-rule.html","articles_title":"E.P.A.

Bush during the waning days of his presidency; and today, the prohibitive favorite to serve as the Republican nominee for Governor of Virginia. \"From immigrant janitor to West Wing of the White House in two generations' time,\"  Gillespie tells the camera  in a slickly produced video introducing his blue-collar roots. \"It's an incredible country.\" But what he has been loathe to emphasize -- in a reflection of this anti-establishment, anti-moneyed moment -- is his ties to a Republican super PAC that, for all its riches, presents a political predicament to candidates running for high office in the first year of Donald Trump's presidency. Slowly and quietly, Gillespie has shed his high-powered connections to the group that he helped found, American Crossroads, ignoring some of its elite donors and forging a new political identity as he stares down a Republican challenge eager to highlight Gillespie's role unleashing the modern campaign-finance system that Trump says he deplores. While campaign aides push back on his role in the formation of Crossroads, describing him as an adviser -- not a founder -- his work ushering in this period of American politics is difficult to ignore. It's led to an unusual dynamic: A super PAC founder running in one of this year's marquee races who is largely not taking advantage of the big-money system that he helped pioneer. Candidates have long sought to publicly play down their connections to wealthy donors in favor of a cracker-barrel profile that endears them to regular voters. But the politics are perhaps never so obvious as they are at this moment, led by a president who has often bellowed to the country that today's donors are corrupting and unseemly. \"All political money these days is a liability,\" said Ed Rogers, a Republican lobbyist close to Gillespie who nevertheless advises him to cash all the checks he can get. \"Net-net, take the money.\" One senior Crossroads fundraiser predicted that GIllespie would soon capitalize on his rich friends -- pointing to a Gillespie finance  event hosted by Bush this month in Dallas  where traditional Crossroads donors cut him a check. And Gillespie aides say that the candidate has never shied away from those funders. Aides argue that during his  run for Senate in 2014 , few believed he had what it took to topple the popular Sen. Mark Warner. At that time, Gillespie was virtually unknown in Virginia and Warner had won statewide by handsome margins on two different occasions. Despite his gravitas with donors, he struggled to collect money. Even when the polls tightened late in that race, Gillespie fundraisers pitched donors for an injection of cash that never came. He and his outside groups ended up being outspent by more than three-to-one -- but he lost the race by less than a percentage point. Gillespie's candidacy is much different this time around, though he has once again not been able to take full advantage of his connections to a network of rich donors. One of his opponents in the GOP primary, though, believes it is only a matter of time. \"Ed Gillespie is a 30-year revolving door lobbyist,\" said Corey Stewart, the  former chair of Trump's campaign  in the state and who is running in his mold, \"desperate to hide the fact he made millions peddling influence as a Washington insider using government to enrich himself.\" The chair of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, Stewart has relentlessly attacked Gillespie's deep ties to Washington, tagging him with the moniker \"Establishment Ed.\" But so far there is little evidence that Stewart's attacks have been effective: The most recent poll, conducted by Christopher Newport University, shows Gillespie with a healthy lead among the three candidates on the ballot. Super PACs, though, are broadly unpopular in today's political climate: Gillespie never mentions Crossroads on the stump, and his official biography makes no mention of it.  And after all, Gillespie is not wanting for funds. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a former business partner of Gillespie's and once a Crossroads fundraiser himself, predicts that in a general election -- with Democrats eager to nationalize the race into a referendum on Trump's presidency -- the donor network he helped cultivate will eventually come home.  Yet a survey of a dozen recent Crossroads donors this week revealed numerous major givers who say they have surprisingly not heard from Gillespie, even though some would gladly cut him a check should he call. \"He's been a friend for a long time,\" said Mel Sembler, a major Republican fundraiser. But Sembler hasn't given -- he \"absolutely\" would if asked, though. \"Who is he again?\" asked media mogul Stan Hubbard, a Crossroads giver who said he deals mostly with former Bush aide Karl Rove, not Gillespie. Gillespie may be discovering that just because Republican donors have funded Crossroads, it does not mean that they will fund him personally. \"Ed's relationship is with more the staff, princples and leadership with Crossroads -- and not neccssarily with the rank-and-file-donors,\" said one person close to the group, granted anonymity to candidly assess the relationship. Gillespie's intimates and multiple people close to Crossroads concede that his ties to the organization have long withered, Immediately after the Citizens United decision upended politics in 2010, Gillespie worked hand-in-glove with Rove to launch a batter of Republican fundraising operations that could allow the GOP to capitalize on the erasure of contribution limits. Since then, however, Gillespie's role has drastically diminished at Crossroads, according to multiple people familiar with the inner workings. Much of the Rove's political operation at Crossroads has been subsumed by that of Mitch McConnell, who has blessed the Crossroads network and launched a new partner organization, Senate Leadership Fund, that gobbled up much of the establishment Republican money in the 2016 race. After McConnell's team held the Senate against tough odds, some predict Rove's role could weaken even more. Nevertheless the donor network that Gillespie built at Crossroads is largely absent from his current run, according to an analysis of Virginia campaign finance disclosures. Donors to Crossroads -- such as Home Depot founder Bernie Marcus or new Trump Cabinet members Linda McMahon and Betsy DeVos -- are responsible for just over $350,000 to Gillespie's gubernatorial political operation, $100,000 of which came solely from the DeVos family. One longtime Crossroads donor, St. Louis billionaire Rex Sinquefeld, met with Gillespie twice since he announced his run for governor, according to Sinquefeld aide Travis Brown, and Sinquefeld admired his commitment to cutting taxes. But Gillespie failed to draw a check out of him, according to campaign finance records. Yet several senior Republicans close to Gillespie and Crossroads predict that the network's donors will eventually come around, arguing that prominent conservative givers won't tolerate a loss in the high-profile off-year election. And for now, sources concede, it's better politics to focus on Virginia givers -- not high-wattage GOP billionaires, who are almost all from out of state. \"After talking to a number of Crossroads donors,\" said the senior group fundraiser, \"I'm confident many are in his corner.\"","articles_date":"10 4 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/08\/politics\/ed-gillespie-trump-big-money\/index.html","articles_title":"Ed Gillespie retreats from big-money past in Trump era","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":86,"issue":6,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Virginia Republican gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie, who is criticizing his Democratic opponent for standing \"with illegal immigrants,\" wrote an editorial in 2006 calling anti-immigration rhetoric a \"political siren song\" and warning the Republican party against becoming an anti-immigration party. Gillespie's argument, published in a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled  \"Populists Beware!\"  in April 2006, appears to contradict his current campaign strategy, which seeks to paint Democrat Ralph Northam as weak on illegal immigration. Gillespie's campaign has a run a  series  of ads attacking Northam for voting \"in favor of sanctuary cities that let dangerous illegal immigrants back on the street\" and linking his vote to the rise of the violent gang MS-13. Mailers from Gillespie's campaign have also attacked Northam for supporting in-state tuition, driver's licenses, and rights for undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes. In his 2006 op-ed, published six months after the Republican nominee in Virginia lost the governor's race and amid nationwide immigrant rights protests, Gillespie argued his long-held position that a comprehensive approach to immigration was needed that would address border security, toughen enforcement of existing immigration laws, and would allow \"illegal immigrants to earn legal status by working, learning English, paying taxes and living crime-free.\" Gillespie, whose firm the Wall Street Journal noted at the time \"represents clients who support a temporary guest worker program,\" then argued that the path offered by populists would doom the Republican Party and pointed to last minute anti-illegal immigration  ads  run by former Republican gubernatorial nominee Jerry Kilgore in 2005, which Gillespie wrote might have cost Kilgore votes. Gillespie's current attacks on Northam echo those ads run by Kilgore in 2005, which hit Democrat Tim Kaine for supporting \"taxpayer-funded job centers\" and \"in-state tuition discounts for illegals.\" \"Populists offer a different immigration plan: Build a bigger wall,\" Gillespie wrote. \"I understand why this message resonates, but it will prove shortsighted. The California GOP struggles today because of what Hispanics saw as an assault on them more than a decade ago by then-Gov. Pete Wilson. In Virginia, Republican gubernatorial candidate Jerry Kilgore ran last-minute anti-immigration ads that didn't move his numbers with swing voters and probably cost him important votes in the Hispanic enclaves of Northern Virginia.\" Gillespie added, \"Anti-immigration rhetoric is a political siren song, and Republicans must resist its lure by lashing ourselves to our party's twin masts of freedom and growth--or our majority will crash on the shoals.\" Asked about the discrepancy between 2006 op-ed and his current campaign, Gillespie campaign spokesman David Abrams told CNN, \"What Ed has been responding to on the campaign trail, and in these ads, is public safety and the threat violent gangs like MS-13 pose to Virginia's communities.\" Abrams pointed to a series of articles about recent violent crimes in Virginia committed by MS-13 gang members. \"This is a serious issue in the Commonwealth, and a gubernatorial candidate should absolutely be talking about it, and putting forward solutions to address it and make our communities safer,\" he added. Northam has  dismissed  Gillespie's attacks on him as \"baseless\" and \"despicable\" and has pointed to his own record as a doctor who treated victims of violence and as a state senator who voted for tougher prison sentences for gang members. In the 2006 op-ed, Gillespie also argued that the Republican majority would be threatened if the party did not increase its support with Hispanic voters. \"The Republican Party cannot become an anti-immigration party,\" he wrote. \"Our majority already rests too heavily on white voters, given that current demographic voting percentages will not allow us to hold our majority in the future. Between 2000 and 2004, President Bush increased his support in the Hispanic community by nine percentage points. Had he not, John Kerry would be president today.\"","articles_date":"10 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/10\/politics\/kfile-gillespie-immigration-oped\/index.html","articles_title":"Ed Gillespie, now running ads against illegal immigration, once called anti-immigrant rhetoric a 'political siren song'","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":87,"issue":5,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump  consoled America's children over a rash of horrific school shootings on Thursday but he made it clear that he's not breaking from his party or political base to shake Washington from polarized positions that fail to stop such tragedies happen again and again. Trump gave an effective and moving first televised response to the tragedy at a Florida high school from the White House, looking into the camera and telling kids: \"I want you to know that you are never alone and you never will be. You have people who care about you, who love you and who will do anything at all to protect you.\" But in an earlier tweet, Trump appeared to blame the people of the Florida community scarred by the murders of 17 students and staff for not doing more to point out how the shooter had become alienated from society. The President seemed to be pre-emptively deflecting the calls for reform of firearms laws that inevitably follow every such outrage. \"So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior,\" Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. \"Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\" Trump's own history of no-holds-barred rhetoric and political method of using social division as a tool of governing threatened, as they have before, to undermine the effectiveness of his love-beats-hate appeal on Thursday and attempt to bring the nation together at a moment of common grief. The juxtaposition between the scripted Trump and the apparently more authentic one on display on Twitter and in his spontaneous remarks poses another leadership test for the President as he prepares to console the surviving victims of the attack in a coming visit to Florida and to shoulder the trauma and mitigate the disagreements of a nation that is split on how to go forward. And even though officials had promised a \"plan that works\" in response to Wednesday's horror, Trump spoke without specifics about the need to improve school safety and the need to improve mental health care. There was, for instance, no talk of whether allowing a 19-year-old -- who could not legally buy an alcoholic drink -- to get a high-powered weapon after passing background checks that could kill multiple people in seconds was a wise choice by society. \"It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make that difference,\" Trump said. But there was no immediate sign that Trump has any inclination to play a leadership role that would have the capacity to redraw the entrenched political stands that both parties are already adopting on gun control after Wednesday's attack. 'Time and place' By initially confining his response to Twitter -- choosing not to appear on camera on Wednesday and canceling the White House daily press briefing -- Trump raised the question of whether the administration is avoiding the inevitable conundrum that arises after such tragedies: Why do they happen here more often than in any other nation? Such a position would be consistent with the White House's line following the Las Vegas massacre in October that killed 58 people. In the aftermath, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders rebuked reporters saying that there was a \"time and a place for a political debate\" but not right after an attack. Trump told reporters after Las Vegas that \"we'll be talking about gun laws as time goes on.\" In retrospect, the comment appeared more an attempt to deflect political pressure than a serious promise to take action as efforts at rudimentary reform in Congress soon fizzled. An official told CNN's Kevin Liptak on Thursday that there was debate in the White House on Wednesday about the merits of a presidential statement. But it was decided it was best to wait until more facts were known about the massacre -- though Trump has never hesitated to rush to judgment during past terror attacks, even as they unfolded. There was also some concern that the President, more at ease with the acerbic rhetoric of divided Washington politics than with words of consolation, would not immediately strike the right tone. \"He can be a warm guy but doesn't always say the right thing,\" the official said.  Trump's absence from the television screens contrasted with the harrowing appearance in the White House briefing room by President Barack Obama, who wiped a tear from his eye after eulogizing the \"beautiful little kids\" cut down in Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Obama also called on Americans in that appearance to launch a political initiative to take \"meaningful action\" to stop mass shootings occurring, an effort that eventually failed and caused him to castigate members of Congress. Partisan breakdown This time, as after the Las Vegas and Texas church massacres last year, and the Orlando shooting in 2016 and the Charleston killings in 2015, there will be calls for action, more gun control, better background checks, bans on assault rifles and high-powered magazines and better mental health care as well as debates about whether violent video games are partly to blame. \"The reaction of the Democrats to any tragedy is to try to politicize it  ... calling we have to take away Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. That is not the right answer,\" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said on \"Fox and Friends.\" Other Republicans suggested that such shootings are simply unexplained acts of evil. Others gave unspecific promises to do something. \"We are going to figure this out,\" said Florida's Republican Gov. Rick Scott on Fox News. House Speaker Paul Ryan bemoaned the awful tragedy, called on his colleagues to think less about \"taking sides and fighting each other politically\" and said his chamber had already done much to stop mentally ill people from getting guns. But earlier, on an Indiana radio show, Ryan made clear that gun control would not be part of the conversations. \"I don't think that means you then roll that conversation into taking away citizens' rights - taking away a law-abiding citizen's rights,\" he said, in an interview with Tom Katz on Indiana radio station WIBC. Some Democrats said that change would only come when voters decide it must. \"If we can break the glacier of complicity in Congress, we can get measures done,\" said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"I think Republicans will act if faced with the prospect of mass losses ... What can be done? In a word, elections.\" Public opinion Usually, after mass shootings, there is a spike in the number of Americans who favor new gun control efforts. But it usually fades when mourning fades from news coverage, giving politicians coverage to give reform a pass. One reason politicians don't pay a price is that there is no national consensus on the gun control issue, which exemplifies a cultural gulf between rural and urban Americans, and liberals and conservatives. Many Republicans sincerely believe their stance on the guns is fundamental to the character of America itself. The National Rifle Association maintains a dominant role in Republican politics, and can also threaten Senate Democrats facing re-election in red states in this year's midterm elections. Republicans, such as Ted Cruz, also immediately equate any modest efforts at gun control or attempts to ban the sale of the most powerful weapons to a bid to crush the constitutional right to bear arms and there's no political incentive for Republicans on Capitol Hill or the White House to take a risky move away from the GOP base on guns. But many liberals from cities and urban areas have never touched a gun or gone hunting and despair at the government's inability to ban assault rifles, limit magazines and improve background checks. They have more in common with people in other Western nations who view America's gun laws as baffling than their conservative compatriots. Gun control advocates also often note that for conservatives, guns are an existential issue and can motivate them to go to the polls. It's not always the case for liberal gun control advocates. Historically, tumultuous societal change -- that modifications to gun laws might represent -- has required incremental steps over decades, as in the fight for civil rights or equality for same-sex couples. There is evidence to show that in the case of guns momentum has been the other way: The assault weapons ban introduced in the 1990s was allowed to expire in 2004. The Florida massacre is unlikely to shift the political terrain. \"I gave absolutely no faith in our Congress or elected officials to do anything,\" former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday.

Joe Manchin -- his daughter runs the company at the center of the scandal.\u00a0 ADVERTISEMENT Colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, are now slamming Mylan and demanding investigations into why prices were jacked so high on the lifesaving allergy treatment drug. The uproar over the increase has become a public relations nightmare for Mylan, CEO Heather Bresch and Manchin, who finally broke his silence on the subject Thursday. \u201cI am aware of the questions my colleagues and many parents are asking and frankly I share their concerns about the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs,\u201d Manchin said in a written statement. \u201cToday I heard Mylan\u2019s initial response, and I am sure Mylan will have a more comprehensive and formal response to those questions.\u201d Manchin, a former West Virginia governor who has served in the U.S. Senate since 2010, said he would work with his \u201ccolleagues and all interested parties to lower the price of prescription drugs and to continue to improve our health care system.\u201d But his comments come days after his colleagues called out his daughter\u2019s company. Several senators \u2013 including Amy Klobuchar, whose daughter uses an EpiPen \u2013 have pressed the Food and Drug Administration for answers and asked if alternatives to the EpiPen are in the works. Klobuchar also wants the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing to investigate the enormous increase in the price of EpiPens. The Minnesota senator sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission to look into whether Mylan violated antitrust laws.\u00a0 For its part, the company said Thursday it is voluntarily reducing the patient cost of EpiPen through savings cards which will cover up to $300 for a two-pack of EpiPen, but some say it\u2019s not enough. Admittedly, Manchin is in a tight spot. In the past, he has taken the lead in going after pharmaceutical companies. He played a big role in pushing to get controversial painkiller Zohydro ER permanently shelved despite the FDA approving the powerful opiate. Manchin, whose home state leads the nation in prescription overdoses and abuse, worked with both Republicans and Democratic lawmakers to overturn the approval. At the time, some questioned his motives, since his campaign to kill Zohydro could benefit his daughter\u2019s company. Though the Mylan epi-scandal hits close to home, Klobuchar believes the senior senator\u2019s connections in Congress won\u2019t deter his colleagues from pursuing answers. \u201cI think we have an obligation to the American people to do our job regardless of who is related to who at a company,\u201d she told reporters Wednesday. \u201cAnd I have never seen Senator Manchin intervene himself in any of these cases involving this company. I\u2019ve never seen that happen. I know him very well.\u201d On Monday, Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Mark Warner, D-Va., also sent a letter to Bresch demanding an explanation.\u00a0 Bresch tried to defend the company's pricing in an interview with CNBC. She seemed to struggle to justify the jump in price but said lowering the price wasn\u2019t an option. \u201cHad we reduced the list price, I couldn\u2019t ensure that everyone who needs an EpiPen gets one,\u201d she said. She argued that much of the $608 price for a two-pack goes to other middle men in the health care consumer chain.\u00a0 But Grassley said in a statement that the price is still what Medicare and insurers have to pay, regardless of the pledge to offset the cost for some patients.\u00a0 Another fact not lost on angry customers is that as the price for EpiPens grew, so did Bresch\u2019s own compensation, which spiked more than 671 percent to $18.9 million last year. The price hike debate has also made it to the campaign trail. Clinton called the company\u2019s pricing strategy \u201coutrageous\u201d and a \u201ctroubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers.\u201d","articles_date":"26 08 2016","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2016\/08\/26\/epipen-price-hike-puts-bipartisan-heat-on-democratic-senators-daughter.html","articles_title":"EpiPen price hike puts bipartisan heat on Democratic senator's daughter","candidate_fk":4,"first_name":"Joe","id":89,"issue":2,"last_name":"Manchin","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Alice Stewart is a CNN political commentator and former communications director for Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign. The views expressed in this commentary are hers.  (CNN) What some view as chaos in the White House is actually a streamlining and synchronization of President Donald Trump's senior team. Much like the drama of a season finale of \"The Apprentice,\" Trump is taking bold steps to shape a staff with strong adherence to his policies and stronger allegiance to him.  At his first cabinet meeting in October of last year, Trump said he had the \"finest group of people ever assembled in a cabinet.\" Five months and nearly two dozen high-level staff departures later, the President  said  he's \"getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want.\"  The bottom line is that no one in the White House is indispensable. Everyone works at the pleasure of the President -- and is there to further his agenda. It's often said that personnel is policy.  And Trump is clearly selecting people whom he believes will achieve his objectives rather than undermine them. Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson due to differing views on North Korea, the Iran deal and diplomatic relations. The President chose the like-minded, hawkish, director of the Central Intelligence Agency Director, Mike Pompeo, as Tillerson's replacement. National Economic Advisor Gary Cohn resigned after a disagreement with Trump on steel tariffs. Trump is  now bringing  on longtime loyalist, former CNBC Economic Analyst Larry Kudlow. While Kudlow shares Cohn's views on trade and has been critical of Trump's steel tariffs, he's a better fit due to his loyalty to Trump.  That said, the rough and tumble nature of the restructuring seems to overshadow the need for it. And whether I was working for a presidential campaign or in an administration, I've noticed that, traditionally, the person at the top would surround himself with like-minded senior staffers -- but also ones who would hold his feet to the fire when needed. The President says he likes to hear opposing views, but I'm not convinced he does -- or that his new cabinet members will feel empowered to be a voice of dissent. When I worked as Communications Director on Governor Mike Huckabee's 2008 presidential campaign, he would always tell us: \"I don't know what I don't know.\" Meaning, if any team member had information vital to the task at hand, they were encouraged to share it with the governor. He wanted a clear line of unfiltered communication.  When it came to major decisions, he would take input from top advisors, discuss solutions and make the best decision regardless of the potential backlash. Senator Rick Santorum built his Senate staff and presidential campaign team with people who shared his world view, but that didn't mean he wanted \"yes men.\" While working on his 2012 presidential campaign, he encouraged us to challenge him on issues because ultimately our argument had to stand up to the opposition. In the end, his decisions were personal, and he would do what he felt was right, regardless of the consequences. On the 2016 presidential campaign, Senator Ted Cruz was always better versed on the issues than others.  However, when it came time for important decisions, he would gather top advisers, hear us out, ask probing questions and make a decision. He valued diverse counsel.  Jen Psaki, who served as President Obama's communications director,  tells me her boss had a \"good BS barometer.\"  She said if everyone at the table was in agreement on an issue, he would ask a junior member his or her opinion just to get a dissenting viewpoint. Former President Bill Clinton Adviser Paul Begala shared with me that Clinton couldn't stand a \"yes man,\" and if someone sucked up to him all the time, he would exclude them. Clinton wanted to know what he didn't know and encouraged a spirited debate on major decisions, often saying, \"I never learned anything from a vigorous agreement.\"   Former adviser to Presidents Nixon, Ford, Regan and Clinton, David Gergen  writes  about former President George W. Bush as a top-down, no-nonsense president who engaged in \"360-degree leadership.\"  Facing big decisions, President Bush would listen to views of everyone in the full circle of public dialogue and make a decision.  President Trump is free to build his staff with a Band of Brothers or a Team of Rivals.  The problem is that the method and mayhem of his team-building doesn't rise to the decorum and dignity of the office. But we knew that when he ran for the job. Past is prologue. For this moment, every job is safe in the White House --until it's not.

But hundreds of thousands of activists across the US also are marking the anniversary of last January's Women's March, and the movement it sparked in 2017. The organizers of the movement hope to keep up the momentum from last year with a weekend of events and rallies across the country. Here's what you need to know about Women's March and related events this weekend. Events across the US to keep an eye on Los Angeles Los Angeles is expected to draw one of the largest crowds. And of course, the march Saturday -- which will take place in Downtown Los Angeles --  will have a lot of star power. Celebrities expected to attend include Scarlett Johansson, Laverne Cox, Sophia Bush, Adam Scott, Olivia Wilde, Alfre Woodard and Megan Mullally. Also attending: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis, Planned Parenthood Los Angeles President & CEO Sue Dunlap, Black Lives Matter's Melina Abdullah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California's executive director, Hector Villagra.  Idina Menzel, Maxwell, Melissa Etheridge and the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles are scheduled to perform. Las Vegas  The Las Vegas event, which will take place at Sam Boyd Stadium on Sunday, will serve as a national voter registration and mobilization tour, which the Women's March organizers have dubbed \"#PowerToThePolls.\"  \"It was very relevant for us to go to Washington, DC, last year to send a message we were all united,\" Linda Sarsour, a Women's March co-organizer,  told CNN . \"When 2018 came around, we had to be really strategic about what message we want to come out of this gathering. And in order for us to put forth a strong message that women are going to lead the victories in 2018 electorally, we had to go to a state that was relevant. We chose Nevada.\" Some of the speakers include:  Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America US Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat US Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat Alicia Garza, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat Maria Teresa Kumar, president & CEO of VotoLatino Mar\u00eda Urbina, national political director at Indivisible Women's March co-chairs Tamika Mallory, Linda Sarsour, Carmen Perez and Bob Bland Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who was announced as an honorary co-chair of the Women's March with Lewis, will not be in attendance. However, she will be featured in a video message that will be played during the event. There will also be live performances by Faith Evans and Ledisi.   New York From New York, there's the 2018 Women's March on NYC hosted by the Women's March Alliance, according to the event's  Facebook page .  The Saturday rally and march will begin at 11 a.m. at Central Park West, between 62nd and 82nd streets, the Facebook page says.  Additionally, the Women's March website lists a  meet-up  on Saturday ahead of Sunday's event in Las Vegas.  Washington, DC In the city that was home to the original Women's March on Washington, there'll be a rally and march on Saturday at the National Mall --  even with a government shutdown , according to  its website.  The event's  Facebook page  says it's being held by March Forward Virginia, the Women's March on Washington 2018. As of Friday night, about 10,000 people had RSVP'd yes on the event's  Facebook page.  Some notable speakers include:  Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia Nuchhi Currier, the president of Woman's National Democratic Club Muthoni Wambu Kraal, EMILY's List vice president for outreach and training  Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee The DC rally will begin at 11 a.m. at the reflecting pool facing the Lincoln Memorial, according to its website.  Sundance Film Festival Last year, thousands marched at the Park City, Utah, event, led by comedian Chelsea Handler. This time around, there will be a Respect Rally on Main Street, according to  The Hollywood Reporter . Jane Fonda, Gloria Allred, Common and Nick Offerman are scheduled to attend. The rally corresponds with another march led by Handler. Both will take place on Saturday at Park City's City Park. Not in one of those cities?  The Women's March  has its own guide to various events  happening around the world this weekend. And some additional events are listed by  March On , which formed as a spinoff organization following the Women's March last year. \"People who wanted to focus on electoral stuff came on board with March On,\" Vanessa Wruble, March On's executive director, said of the Women's March. \"Those who are more focused on immigration and racial justice probably gravitated more toward Women's March Inc.\" The goals remain the same, however: To get people to vote in 2018. March On has a similar initiative to the Women's March called \"March On The Polls.\" How to follow along CNN will air special programming all day surrounding Trump's one-year anniversary.

A federal jury convicted Blankenship on Dec. 3 of a misdemeanor conspiracy to violate mine safety standards at Upper Big Branch. Blankenship spoke briefly during the sentencing hearing and said he wanted to reassure the families of the fallen miners that they were \"great guys, great\u00a0coal\u00a0miners.\" The main point he wanted to express, he said, was \"sorrow to the families and everyone about what happened.\" In his next breath, he denied culpability. \"It is important to everyone that you know that I'm not guilty of a crime,\" Blankenship said. Blankenship's attorneys contended he should receive probation and a fine, at most. The judge denied their motion for Blankenship to remain free as he appeals. It's not clear when he must report to prison. As Blankenship left the courthouse, a few family members of miners who were killed started yelling at him while he and his attorneys spoke with reporters. \"We buried our kid because of you,\" said Robert Atkins, whose son Jason died in the explosion. \"That's all I got is a goddamn tombstone.\" Asked by a reporter what he had to say to the shouting family members, Blankenship said: \"Well, just that the\u00a0coal\u00a0miners didn't cause the accident.\" Then about a half-dozen law enforcement officers surrounded Blankenship and his team and ushered them into an awaiting van. Four investigations found worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited accumulations of\u00a0coal\u00a0dust and methane gas. Broken and clogged water sprayers then allowed what should have been a minor flare-up to become an inferno. Blankenship disputes those reports. He believes natural gas in the mine, and not methane gas and excess\u00a0coal\u00a0dust, was at the root of the explosion. The sentence drew praise from U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin and the United Mine Workers of America, and capped a wide-spanning investigation into Massey following the explosion. Four other workers in the corporate chain were convicted of crimes including faking a foreman's license, lying to federal investigators and conspiring in an illegal scheme to warn miners and other subsidiaries of surprise safety inspections. Their sentences ranged from less than a year to more than three years in prison. The judge described Blankenship's rise from a meager, single-mother Appalachian household to one of the wealthiest, most influential figures in the region and in the\u00a0coal\u00a0industry. \"Instead of being to be able to tout you as a success story, we are here as a result of your part in a dangerous conspiracy,\" she said. During the trial, prosecutors called Blankenship a bullish micromanager who meddled in the smallest details of Upper Big Branch. They said Massey's safety programs were just a facade \u2014 never backed by more money to hire additional miners or take more time on safety tasks. Blankenship was acquitted of felonies that could have stretched his sentence to 30 years. On Wednesday, lead defense attorney William Taylor said the former U.S. attorney was \"using this case as part of the reason to vote for him.\" Booth Goodwin left the office shortly after Blankenship's conviction to run for governor. \"Well, when all else fails, attack the prosecutor,\" Goodwin said after the sentencing. In 2011, Alpha Natural Resources, which bought Massey after the explosion, agreed to pay $210 million to compensate grieving families, bankroll cutting-edge safety improvements and pay for years of violations by Massey Energy. Under the deal with federal prosecutors, Alpha wasn't criminally charged. The judge already ruled that Blankenship won't have to pay $28 million in restitution to Alpha Natural Resources, helping him avoid a serious blow to his personal fortune. Berger also ruled that Blankenship would not have to pay restitution to about 100 people, including former miners and family members.","articles_date":"06 04 2016","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2016\/04\/06\/ex-coal-ceo-gets-1-year-in-prison-for-deadliest-mine-blast-in-decades.html","articles_title":"Ex-coal CEO gets 1 year in prison for deadliest mine blast in decades","candidate_fk":1,"first_name":"Don","id":93,"issue":6,"last_name":"Blankenship","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Former coal executive Don Blankenship is scheduled to be sentenced for a conviction connected to the deadliest U.S. mine explosion in four decades.

Clinton, in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria as part of her ongoing book tour, said she was \"sick\" and \"shocked\" when she found out about the sexual assault allegations, first revealed in a bombshell report  by The New York Times  and then further reported in a detailed  report by The New Yorker . \"I was appalled. It was something that was just intolerable in every way,\" she said. \"And, you know, like so many people who've come forward and spoken out, this was a different side of a person who I and many others had known in the past.\" On her donations, Clinton added that it wasn't possible to give the money back but that she would donate it to charity. Later Thursday, a Clinton aide said the former secretary of state will donate roughly $13,000 to a women's organization that has not yet been named. The donation will cover Weinstein's contributions to her 2000 Senate primary race, the 2006 Senate primary and general election, the 2007 presidential primary and the 2015 and 2016 presidential primary and general election, the aide said. \"What other people are saying, what my former colleagues are saying, is they're going to donate it to charity, and of course I will do that,\" she said. \"I give 10% of my income to charity every year, this will be part of that. There's no -- there's no doubt about it.\" Clinton said she had no idea that Weinstein acted that way in private, despite some in Hollywood saying that people close to him had known. \"I certainly didn't, and I don't know who did,\" she said. \"But I can only speak for myself, and I think speak for many others who knew him primarily through politics.\" The full interview with Clinton will air Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Eastern. Weinstein has long been a top Democratic donor and during the 2016 campaign he served as a key bridge between the Clinton campaign and the wealthy world of Hollywood stars. Throughout Clinton's political career, Weinstein helped raise around $1.5 million for Democrats and associated groups by bundling donations, according to data from the campaign finance-tracking Center for Responsive Politics. Clinton also headlined multiple fundraisers hosted by Weinstein. The two were also personally close: In 2015, the Clintons rented a home next to Weinstein in the Hamptons. Clinton said Wednesday that she would have considered the Hollywood producer a friend. \"People in Democratic politics for a couple of decades appreciated his help and support. And I think these stories coming to light now,\" She said. \"And people who never spoke out before having the courage to speak out, just clearly demonstrates that this behavior that he engaged in, cannot be tolerated and cannot be overlooked.\" Clinton's initial silence -- it took her days to release a statement -- was perplexing to some Democrats, with even some longtime advisers privately questioning the decision not to quickly weigh in. \"I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein,\" Clinton said in a statement five days after the allegations broke, through her spokesman Nick Merrill. \"The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.\" Pressure grew on Clinton after her former running mate and Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine told CNN on Tuesday that \"any leader should condemn\" Weinstein. In the interview, Clinton also heralded the women who have spoken out against Weinstein. \"The courage of these women coming forward now is really important because it can't just end with one person's disgraceful behavior and the consequences that he is now facing,\" she said. \"This has to be a wake-up call and shine a bright spotlight on anything like this behavior anywhere, at any time.\" CNN's Sophie Tatum contributed to this report.

Reps. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican, and Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat and whip for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have been quietly working for weeks to develop their legislation, which the two sophomore lawmakers are releasing as a discussion draft as talks heat up on DACA ahead of a government funding deadline January 19 being used as leverage in Congress. The hope is, they say, that putting out a bipartisan proposal could speed up talks about resolving the issue. The plan aims to be \"as narrow as possible,\" Hurd told CNN in an exclusive joint interview with Aguilar on Sunday night about the proposal. The legislation draws heavily from other proposed legislation, a conscious decision by the two congressmen to lean on language that has already been vetted by committees and lawmakers, they say.  At the core of the deal would be a legislative way to enact DACA, an Obama administration program that protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation that Trump has decided to end.  The bill would offer qualifying individuals the ability to get in line for a green card and eventual citizenship after years of conditional residency, provided they meet certain requirements, including a background check and work, education or military service requirements. The bill doesn't make explicit reference to sponsoring relatives, but the bill summary notes that existing law would prohibit parents of these individuals who came to the US illegally to apply for a visa to come back without returning to their home country for at least 10 years before applying and the bill does nothing to erase that requirement. That addresses \"chain migration,\" or family-based migration, that Trump says he wants to cut. Other provisions include increasing the number of immigration judges and attorneys, as the Justice Department has sought, to reduce the lengthy backlog of cases in immigration courts that cause people to stay in the US in limbo for years. The bill also coordinates efforts to improve conditions in Central America, to address factors that send undocumented immigrants to the US. For the border, the bill draws heavily from Hurd's \"smart wall\" bill that would direct the Department of Homeland Security to gain \"operational control\" of the border by the end of 2020 through \"technology, physical barriers, levees, tools and other devices,\" according to a bill summary shared with CNN.  Both lawmakers said they hope the deal can provide a basis for Congress to resolve the DACA issue, which Trump has said he wants replaced but only if paired with his border wall and some other immigration fixes.  Leadership has not officially blessed Hurd and Aguilar's work, but party leaders on both sides, including the White House, have been looped in on its development, the lawmakers said.  \"This is a DACA and border security fix,\" Hurd said. \"And if there's other elements that have to be included in a broader deal to get signed into law, this is a foundation for that conversation.\" Aguilar said he has been whipping \"in the weeds\" on the issue, and Hurd has been working on his side of the aisle. Neither gave numbers of supporters, though Hurd estimated \"dozens of Republicans\" could back it.  \"This is the building block that would have bipartisan support if it was on the floor tomorrow,\" Aguilar added. \"I feel confident about that. I feel the same as Will, if there are other pieces that have to come to get a signature, we'll take a look.\" Unlikely allies Both lawmakers were elected in 2014, both defeating incumbent congressmen of the opposite party, and both defended their seats in rematch challenges in 2016.  The partnership evolved out of Congressional Hispanic Caucus efforts to engage Republicans and see what they could support, Aguilar said. He even checked with his colleague Democrat Beto O'Rourke, whose district neighbors Hurd's and who did a 24-hour livestreamed road trip with him to DC. O'Rourke affirmed that Hurd could be trusted, Aguilar said.  Both noted that they were not in Congress for previous immigration reform battles, unlike some of their counterparts in the Senate and broader House negotiations, something they see as an advantage. \"I think it grew out of two folks that, we don't have all the wounds from all the other in-fights over these topics,\" Hurd said.  \"We're having really substantive discussions in a way that some of our colleagues can't because they're trying to fight the battles from 10 and 15 and 20 years ago, or because this isn't something that they work with or see a lot,\" Aguilar added.  Aguilar represents the whip operation of the Hispanic caucus, which has been one of the leading voices on the left and closely listened to by Democratic leadership in negotiating a deal. Hurd's district in Texas contains the most border of any lawmaker in Congress, from the outer ring of El Paso on the western edge of Texas to the region due south of San Antonio in the middle of the state. It includes more than 800 miles of border with Mexico, which is more than one-third of the entire US-Mexico border. It's also a district Hillary Clinton won in the last election and has a heavy Hispanic population. That combination of knowledge, the duo says, was key.  \"From my perspective, he has the most knowledge of issues that are going on in a border district than any member I've worked with or talked to, period, irrespective of party affiliation,\" Aguilar said. \"This is about solving the problem, and the only way you solve the problem is to do it with people that have the respect of their colleagues and knowledge of the problem, and that is Pete Aguilar,\" Hurd said.","articles_date":"8 1 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/01\/08\/politics\/bipartisan-daca-compromise-plan-unveiled\/index.html","articles_title":"Exclusive: Pair of lawmakers unveil bipartisan DACA plan  ","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":97,"issue":5,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Douglas Heye is a CNN political commentator and former deputy chief of staff to then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.  (CNN) \"I try very hard not to swear at home,\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, told  The Hill  in 2014.  Three years and a Donald Trump presidential campaign later, the senator is less constrained about dropping so-called \" f-bombs \" in private or in public. Speaking to the Personal Democracy Forum last week, Gillibrand used the word twice. Last month in a  New York Magazine  interview, the senator dropped three f-bombs.     She's not alone. Earlier this year, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, in a speech in which children were not just present but actually on stage,  attacked President Trump  as someone who \"doesn't give a  s*** about healthcare,\" while also saying \"your g**damn right,\" Trump is a liar.  Beto O'Rourke , the Texas Democratic Congressman challenging Sen. Ted Cruz accused Cruz of \"sure as s***  not serving\" his constituents. And  Kamala Harris , the California Democratic senator, reportedly also used the f-word at a public event in San Francisco. If this language is something of a new normal among Democratic politicians, their reactions represent a new normal, as well. In the past, politicians typically apologized for such language.  In part, that may be because past instances were mistakes, where a politician said the wrong thing while speaking passionately on an issue or opponent. In today's Trump-changed political environment, this language is no mistake; it is intentional, calculated \"spontaneity\" designed to draw headlines and demonstrate outrage to similarly minded activists and donors -- using some of Trump's methodology to show their strong resistance to him. After the titillating \"sugar rush\" these Democrats get from the sensationalism of using naughty words, there does not appear to be any substance behind it aside from projecting some sort of \"authenticity\" for speaking in the same way voters angry at Washington do. Democratic politicians using this language not only run the risk of distracting from their anti-Trump message, but may wind up looking like they're trying too hard, a phoniness voters can spot a mile away. Meanwhile, not only are apologies few and far between, but Democrats defend and promote the language. Gillibrand  tweeted  out a video of her remarks, while joking about contributing to a swear jar. The Democratic National Committee has not only doubled-down on Perez's blue remarks, but seeks to profit off them by  selling  \"Democrats give a  s*** about people\" t-shirt. (Yes, the Obama campaign similarly sold Obamacare as a \"BFD,\" but Vice President Joe Biden's remark was as much of a gaffe as it was a rarity). Just eight months ago, one of Hillary Clinton's most prominent  closing ads warned  that \"Our children are listening,\" as the ad played a greatest hits of Trump's off-color comments, while former first lady Michelle Obama repeated time and again on the campaign trail, \"When they go low, we go high.\"  These were key messages Democrats used to ingrain into voters' minds that Trump was too callous and profane to serve as president. Now? More and more Democrats appear to be in a non-stop limbo contest of words, knowing the lower they go, the more headlines and clicks they can get. To be sure, Democrats will continue to decry Trump's politics and personality -- and will continue using one of the tactics Trump employed during the campaign -- using  four-letter words  to evoke outrage from supporters and gain media coverage.  If anything, the number of Democrats following the example of their party leaders and potential 2020 candidates using this, and possibly other Trump tactics, will only increase. That Trump's campaign and presidency has forever altered the Republican Party is seen as a given. Less discussed is how the Trump-era has already affected how Democrats campaign and how they are trying to use Trump's own tactics against him.","articles_date":"12 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/12\/opinions\/democrats-f-bomb-opinion-heye\/index.html","articles_title":"F-bombs could backfire on Democrats","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":98,"issue":6,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Last month, a friend of the wealthy conservative donor Rebekah Mercer arrived at Facebook\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters. His task: Find out what \u2014 if anything \u2014 could repair relations between Facebook, the world\u2019s biggest social media company, and Cambridge Analytica, the voter-profiling firm co-founded by her father and used by the Trump campaign. The revelation last month that Cambridge Analytica improperly  acquired the private Facebook data of millions of users  has set off government inquiries in Washington and London, plunging Facebook into crisis. But it has also battered the nascent political network overseen by Ms. Mercer, 44, and financed by her father, Robert Mercer, 71, a hard-line conservative billionaire. Ms. Mercer\u2019s standing in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle had already declined following the departure last year of Stephen K. Bannon, her family\u2019s former adviser and President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, according to Republicans with close ties to the president\u2019s political operation. A pro-Trump advocacy group controlled by Ms. Mercer has gone silent following strategic disputes between her and other top donors. Plans to  wage a civil war against the Republican establishment  in the 2018 midterms have been derailed. And last month, after reports on Cambridge in The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian, Facebook banned the company from its platform, a major blow to any political or commercial targeting firm. Not a single American candidate or \u201csuper PAC\u201d committee has reported payments to the company since the 2016 campaign, according to federal records. Several Republicans in Ms. Mercer\u2019s orbit or with knowledge of Cambridge\u2019s business said that fallout from the Facebook scandal \u2014 combined with widespread doubts about the accuracy of Cambridge\u2019s psychological profiles of voters \u2014 had effectively crippled the firm\u2019s election work in the United States. \u201cThey\u2019re selling magic in a bottle,\u201d said Matt Braynard, who worked alongside Cambridge on the Trump campaign, for which he served as the director of data and strategy, and now runs Look Ahead America, a group seeking to turn out disaffected rural and blue-collar voters. \u201cAnd they\u2019re becoming toxic.\u201d The Mercers have made no public statements about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s troubles. Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Mercer declined to answer questions about her role in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle or the Facebook meeting about Cambridge Analytica. But the effort by Ms. Mercer\u2019s friend to help mend fences with Facebook hints at both Cambridge\u2019s importance to her family\u2019s political ambitions and the perils posed by Facebook\u2019s ban. Although a Cambridge spokesman last month downplayed Ms. Mercer\u2019s role at the company \u2014 saying she had a \u201cbroad business oversight\u201d role and no involvement in its daily operations \u2014 she serves on the company\u2019s board and in the past has worked to drum up campaign business for Cambridge, according to Republicans who have worked with or competed against the firm. Former Cambridge employees said she was close to Alexander Nix, the company\u2019s chief executive, who was suspended last month after reports on Cambridge\u2019s harvesting of Facebook data. Ms. Mercer\u2019s intermediary with Facebook was Matthew Michelsen, a tech entrepreneur and investor based in San Diego, who lists his employer as GothamAlpha, a consulting firm.  According to his LinkedIn profile , he has also advised major Silicon Valley companies, including Facebook and Palantir, a data-mining firm and intelligence contractor. Mr. Michelsen\u2019s meeting came on March 20, the day after  Facebook announced that Cambridge  had agreed to let it audit the firm\u2019s computer servers. Mr. Michelsen met informally with a Facebook acquaintance who was accompanied by a Facebook lawyer, according to a person briefed on the meeting, and both Cambridge Analytica and the Mercers were discussed. The person discussed the meeting on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about it publicly. No immediate actions were taken as a result of Mr. Michelsen\u2019s outreach. Mr. Michelsen acknowledged in an interview on Thursday that he visited the company but he would not discuss the purpose of the trip, citing nondisclosure agreements Facebook required him to sign. Ms. Mercer declined to say whether she and Mr. Michelsen had discussed the purpose of the meeting or whether he had briefed her on it afterward. Cambridge also mounted a more formal effort to assuage Facebook, the person said, sending its own lawyers to meet with Facebook on the same day Mr. Michelsen was there. The Cambridge lawyers asked Facebook officials whether the firm could be reinstated on the platform. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive,  acknowledged that meeting  in an interview with The Times last month, saying that his company had not decided whether to lift the ban. A Cambridge spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. In  a lengthy public statement  on Monday, the company stated that \u201cthe vast majority of our business is commercial rather than political, contrary to the way some of the media has portrayed us.\u201d In recent years, the Mercers have become among the most prominent and highly scrutinized political donors in the United States. In the early years of the Obama administration, they began doling out tens of millions of dollars to an eclectic array of conservative groups \u2014 many of them outside Washington\u2019s mainline Republican establishment. Mr. Mercer invested $10 million in Breitbart News, the nationalist website, bringing on Mr. Bannon as chairman, while Ms. Mercer joined the boards of leading conservative think tanks. The Mercers were critical of the Republican Party\u2019s existing data apparatus, which was controlled by the party officials and consultants they hoped to disempower. Mr. Mercer bankrolled Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and Ms. Mercer encouraged candidates and PACs that took the family\u2019s money to also hire the family\u2019s data firm. Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, the Mercers backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, putting millions of dollars \u2014 and Cambridge Analytica \u2014 behind him. But after Mr. Trump prevailed in the primaries, the Mercers switched candidates. In summer 2016, Ms. Mercer helped orchestrate a shake-up that put Mr. Bannon at the head of the Trump campaign. After Mr. Trump won the presidential election, he attended a costume ball at the Mercer estate on Long Island. Ms. Mercer secured a slot on his transition team and prime seats at his inauguration. As Mr. Trump took office, she sought to take a leading role in America First Policies, a nonprofit formed to back the president\u2019s agenda. Last spring, Ms. Mercer and her father  attended the Time 100 black-tie gala , where she was feted as  one of the country\u2019s most influential people . But her insistence on using Cambridge to provide the Trump group with voter data, and other clashes over strategy, alienated other donors and Trump allies, according to other Republicans. Ms. Mercer formed her own group, Making America Great, and hired Emily Cornell, a Cambridge executive, to run it. Yet after an initial splash of spending in 2017 to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on environmental deregulation and other issues, Making America Great appears to have gone quiet. Ms. Cornell said she was no longer affiliated with Making America Great and could not comment on the group. In November, Mr. Mercer  stepped down  from the helm of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world\u2019s most successful hedge funds, as some investors began expressing dismay over his alliance with Mr. Trump. The family is likely to retain significant influence in broader conservative circles thanks to its vast fortune, which finances donations that many political organizations and candidates are eager to accept. The family foundation handed out about $20 million to more than two dozen conservative think tanks, charter school groups, watchdog outfits and other nonprofit organizations in 2016, according to its most recent tax return. Ms. Mercer remains a trustee of the Heritage Foundation, a prominent Washington think tank that has  provided the Trump administration with grist  for a range of initiatives. The foreign policy hawk John R. Bolton, whose super PAC the Mercers lavished with cash and whom Ms. Mercer once lobbied the White House to make secretary of state, was recently tapped to become Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser. The family has also donated $4.5 million to Republican candidates and super PACs during the 2018 election cycle, putting the Mercers among the top 20 donors in the country. And the father-daughter duo still inspire fear: Virtually no Republicans were willing to speak on the record about the family\u2019s troubles. \u201cI would not confuse silence with them being out,\u201d said Dan K. Eberhart, a Colorado drilling-services executive who is active in America First Policies, now the lead pro-Trump political advocacy group. \u201cI think they\u2019re very strategic, and I think they\u2019re quiet folks.\u201d Any contributions the family gives directly to candidates and super PACs will be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission. But their contributions to ideological nonprofit groups like the Heartland Institute, which disputes the scientific consensus on climate change, may become less visible in the future. In 2016, when the Mercers\u2019 backing of Mr. Trump subjected the family to intense public scrutiny, the Mercer foundation\u2019s largest contribution was to DonorsTrust,  an advisory group  for conservative givers. That grant, the Mercer foundation\u2019s first recorded contribution to DonorsTrust, could herald a shift in the family\u2019s philanthropic strategy. DonorsTrust helps wealthy conservatives obtain charitable tax benefits while \u2014 if so desired \u2014 shielding their giving from public view. The donor records a contribution to DonorsTrust and recommends potential recipients, while grantees receive a donation from DonorsTrust charitable vehicles. In 2016, DonorsTrust disbursed more than $66 million worth of such grants. \u201cDonor-advised funds offer you any level of privacy you\u2019d like from the receiving organization,\u201d states a promotional pamphlet available from  the DonorsTrust  web site . \u201cA donor can ask the fund provider to share their full name with one favored grantee and keep their identity private from other.\u201d Such privacy can be useful to donors who \u201cmay be supporting a sensitive or personal cause that could endanger familial or professional harmony,\u201d according to the pamphlet. Such mechanisms, which are legal, are used by many donors on the right and the left. Ms. Mercer declined to answer questions about whether she intended to shift more of her family\u2019s future political philanthropy into intermediaries like DonorsTrust. A 2017 tax return for the Mercer foundation is not yet publicly available. \u201cMs. Mercer is a private person,\u201d her spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cAnd she does not intend to discuss with the media either the conversations she has with her close friends or her philanthropic and charitable giving.\u201d Lawson Bader, the president of DonorsTrust, referred questions to the Mercers. \u201cI do not discuss DonorsTrust accounts real or imagined,\u201d he said in an email. The Facebook scandal has hit just as the Mercers appear to be expanding their business in the world of big data. Public records show that Ms. Mercer, her sister Jennifer and Mr. Nix  serve as directors of Emerdata , a British data company formed in August by top executives at Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate, SCL Group, according to British corporate records. Incorporation documents state that Emerdata specializes in \u201cdata processing, hosting and related activities.\u201d An SCL official  told Channel 4, a British television station , that Emerdata was established last year to combine SCL and Cambridge under one corporate entity. Exactly what ambitions the Mercers, who joined the Emerdata board last month, have for the company is unclear. Another Emerdata director, Johnson Ko Chun Shun, is a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince \u2014 the brother of the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and founder of the private security firm formerly known as Blackwater. Mr. Ko, who declined to comment, is a substantial shareholder and deputy chairman in Mr. Prince\u2019s Africa-focused logistics company, Frontier Services Group. Mr. Ko and Mr. Prince have links to the Chinese government: Another major Frontier investor is Citic, a state-owned Chinese financial conglomerate that for decades has employed the sons and daughters of the Communist Party\u2019s elite families. Emerdata has a second Hong Kong-based director, Peng Cheng. Little public information about Ms. Peng, a British citizen, is available. But a woman with the same name is the chief executive of a publishing and online game company located in the same Hong Kong office tower as Frontier Services. In 2016, Mr. Ko\u2019s brokerage company said it would buy a stake in Ms. Peng\u2019s company, Culturecom. While in Hong Kong in September to speak at a conference, Mr. Nix  told Bloomberg  that Cambridge Analytica was looking into China for commercial ventures. \u201cWe\u2019ve been scoping this market for about a year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see huge opportunity to bring some of these technologies to advertising and marketing space brands.\u201d","articles_date":"10 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/10\/us\/politics\/mercer-family-cambridge-analytica.html","articles_title":"Facebook Fallout Deals Blow to Mercers\u2019 Political Clout","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":99,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"More than 1,400 samples collected inside West Virginia's Upper Big Branch mine show excessive amounts of coal dust were present before an explosion killed 29 miners in April, a federal official said Friday. A majority of the samples came from areas affected by the explosion, but show only that coal dust played a role in the blast, Mine Safety and Health Administration official Kevin Stricklin said during a conference call with reporters. \"It's going to be fair to say that coal dust played a role,\" Stricklin said. \"We just aren't in a position to say how big of a role.\" The findings bolster MSHA's preliminary findings issued 10 days after the explosion that a mix of methane and coal dust were responsible for the blast. Federal law requires coal mines to coat coal dust with pulverized stone or other inert material to prevent and contain explosions. The explosion was the deadliest at a U.S. coal mine since 1970 and is now the subject of civil and criminal investigations. Mine owner Massey Energy Co. criticized MSHA for releasing the test results. \"This is not the first time MSHA has attempted to use unproven or faulty coal dust claims in their investigation efforts,\" the Richmond, Va.-based company said in a statement. A federal administrative law judge rejected citations MSHA issued for rock dust violations after a deadly explosion at an Alabama coal mine in 2001. Massey General Counsel Shane Harvey said \"it's pretty important\" to note that MSHA issued citations for similar alleged rock dust violations after that accident. \"That was flatly rejected,\" Harvey said. MSHA contends that samples taken after an explosion contain less coal dust than they would have before a blast. \"The explosion has had the opportunity to eat up or use up, burn up some of the combustible materials,\" Stricklin said. Inspection logs filled out by Massey employees before the blast showed problems with coal dust as well. The Associated Press reported Sunday that those handwritten logs showed eight of the mine's conveyer belts had excessive amounts of coal dust 32 minutes before the explosion at 3:02 p.m. on April 5. Harvey said the company believed the mine was properly rock dusted at the time of the explosion. The logs, which Massey turned over to investigators, also show the mine routinely had to deal with excessive coal dust along the belts. MSHA has collected 1,803 dust samples so far and 79 percent contained too little inert material to comply with the law, Stricklin said. Most of the samples came from parts of the mine affected by the explosion, with a minority taken just past the spot where seven of the victims were found. Investigators still need samples from two areas that had been flooded in the 12-mile underground complex, Stricklin said. One of those areas is now drained, which will allow investigators to enter it and begin mapping, sampling and searching for clues. Stricklin expects pumping will begin shortly in the second area. MSHA also is still searching for a methane detector that should have been at the mine's main working face and a remote control for the longwall mining machine used in that area. The agency also plans to recreate the mine's ventilation scheme as it would have been at the time of the blast. \"The majority of the underground work has been complete.\" On the surface, investigators have conducted 235 interviews and plan about 20 more, Stricklin said. The agency is still considering whether it needs to interview Massey Chief Executive Don Blankenship. Following the investigation, MSHA may cite Massey for violations that investigators determine contributed to the explosion and deaths. The agency also could fine the company. The criminal investigation is being handled separately by the U.S. Department of Justice. MSHA's latest update came a day after Massey warned investors to brace for another quarterly loss, complaining that tougher enforcement was hurting productivity. MSHA director Joe Main reacted quickly, saying mine operators are responsible for finding and fixing hazards instead of relying on government inspectors. \"When the industry comes to grips with this issue and figures out a way to beef up their health and safety programs, there's going to be less enforcement action for MSHA to take,\" Main said.","articles_date":"17 09 2010","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2010\/09\/17\/federal-official-tests-excessive-coal-dust-wva-deadly-april-blast.html","articles_title":"Federal official: tests show excessive coal dust found in W.Va. mine before deadly April blast","candidate_fk":1,"first_name":"Don","id":100,"issue":6,"last_name":"Blankenship","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"The former CEO who oversaw the West Virginia mine that exploded in 2010, killing 29 people, was indicted Thursday on federal charges related to a mine safety investigation that followed the blast. ADVERTISEMENT U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said a federal grand jury indicted former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship on charges that include conspiracy to violate mandatory federal mine safety and health standards, conspiracy to impede federal mine safety officials, making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission and securities fraud. Blankenship could face up to 31 years in prison if convicted. The indictment alleges Blankenship conspired to violate mine safety and health standards at the Upper Big Branch Mine from January 2008 until April 2010, when an explosion at the mine killed 29 coal miners. Specifically, the indictment said Blankenship was part of a conspiracy to provide advance warning of federal mine safety inspections, allowing mine bosses to conceal and cover up safety violations. After the explosion, Blankenship made false statements and representations to the SEC concerning Massey Energy's safety practices prior to the explosion. He made similar statements in connection with the purchase and sale of Massey Energy stock, the indictment said. Alpha Natural Resources bought Massey for $7.1 billion in June 2012. Blankenship, who retired ahead of the merger, has denied any wrongdoing Four investigations into the Upper Big Branch explosion found that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited accumulations of coal dust and methane gas. Broken and clogged water sprayers allowed what should have been a minor flare-up to become an inferno. The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said the root cause was Massey's \"systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts\" to conceal life-threatening problems. MSHA said managers even maintained two sets of pre-shift inspection books \u2014 an accurate one for themselves, and a sanitized one for regulators.","articles_date":"13 11 2014","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2014\/11\/13\/feds-ex-ceo-who-oversaw-wva-mine-that-exploded-killing-2-indicted-on-federal.html","articles_title":"Feds: Ex-CEO who oversaw W.Va. mine that exploded, killing 29, indicted on federal charges","candidate_fk":1,"first_name":"Don","id":101,"issue":6,"last_name":"Blankenship","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Senators were stunned Tuesday when their colleague Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican and occasional target of President Donald Trump's ire, walked onto the Senate floor,  delivered a blistering speech on the state of the country's politics  and announced he would no longer seek re-election for the Senate in 2018.  \"It's a very sad day. He was a very good man and a very good senator,\" Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters. As Flake delivered his remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday, a handful of Republican and Democratic lawmakers sat, listening intently. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell turned to watch Flake on the floor. And, as Flake's speech concluded, some including Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee gave Flake a standing ovation. \"It's been one of the great honors of my life to have the opportunity to serve with a man of integrity and honor and decency and commitment to not only Arizona, but the United States of America,\" McCain said on the Senate floor. \"I have seen Jeff Flake stand up for what he believes in knowing full well that there would be a political price to pay.\" But Flake's surprising announcement also caught his Democratic colleagues off guard. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virgnia Democrat, came off the Senate floor after Flake's announcement, with tears in his eyes. \"When someone as good and decent a person as Jeff Flake does not think he can continue in the body, it's a very tragic day for the institution,\" Kaine told reporters. Flake's announcement capped off a busy day on Capitol Hill.  Yet another public spat between  President Donald Trump and Corker, the Senate foreign relations committee chairman, dominated the morning. Trump tweeted that Corker couldn't even get elected dog catcher.  But Corker said that he and Flake hadn't coordinated their Tuesday criticisms of Trump. Instead, Corker said he had only learned of Flake's decision not to seek re-election shortly after members had lunch with Trump on Capitol Hill. \"He is kind of quiet but he stands for all the things that have made our nation great and is willing to continue to say that even though we have demagogues and others who end up trying to take us in other directions,\" Corker said. Asked if Corker would consider a bid for the White House in 2020 with Flake, Corker quipped: \"Oh the dog catcher theory! You know, I do like dogs.\" Still, Flake's decision not to seek re-election casts questions about the future of the GOP Senate majority. Flake was only one of many GOP senators who publicly tangled with Trump over the last year. And Flake was just one of many senators who Trump ally Steve Bannon had threatened to unseat in the midterms. If Flake was out, what did it mean for the party? \"Every senator speaks for themselves,\" said Sen. John Barrasso, who is up in 2018 and has been threatened with a primary challenger. \"I continue to be very privileged to represent the people of Wyoming and hope to continue to do that in the future as long as they'll have me.\" CNN's Ted Barrett and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","articles_date":"24 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/24\/politics\/senate-reaction-jeff-flake\/index.html","articles_title":"Fellow lawmakers surprised Flake won't run again","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":102,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2014  The financial assets available to Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz that might allow him to hire a private lawyer will be examined at a court hearing.

Jeff Flake announced Wednesday he's backing a bill to increase the minimum age to buy a semi-automatic rifle, lending bipartisan support to legislation that was introduced last week by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein in the wake of the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.  \"A kid too young buy a handgun should be too young to buy an #AR15,\" Flake, of Arizona,  said in a tweet . \"Working with @SenFeinstein on a bipartisan bill that will raise the minimum purchase age for non-military buyers from 18 to 21 - the same age you currently have to be to purchase a handgun.\" The idea has emerged as potential compromise among GOP and Democratic lawmakers -- who are sharply divided and therefore gridlocked on gun control issues -- as they search for a response to killings by 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, a former student at the school. Cruz used an AR-15 style weapon, which he purchased legally,  to kill 17 people.  They are also considering a bipartisan bill to improve reporting compliance by states and federal agencies to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.  \"Under current law, licensed gun dealers cannot sell a handgun to anyone under 21, but they are allowed to sell assault rifles like the AR-15 to anyone over 18. This policy is dangerous and makes absolutely not sense,\" Feinstein of California said when introducing her bill last week. \"If you can't buy a handgun or a bottle of beer, you shouldn't be able to buy an AR-15.\" Flake announced last fall  he would not seek re-election  for his Senate seat.  At a White House forum Wednesday on school shootings with parents, teachers and student survivors of recent tragedies, President Donald Trump was urged to consider raising the age at which such weapons could be purchased, something he appeared to embrace. \"In addition to what we're going to do about background checks, we're going to go very strong into age, age of purchase, and we're also going to go very strong into the mental health aspect,\" Trump said. But the measure ran into powerful headwinds Wednesday evening, when the National Rifle Association announced it rejects lifting the age for purchasing rifles. \"Federal Law prohibits adults under the age of 21 from purchasing a handgun from a licensed firearm dealer. Legislative proposals that prevent law-abiding adults aged 18-20 years old from acquiring rifles and shotguns effectively prohibits them for purchasing any firearm, thus depriving them of their constitutional right to self-protection,\" said Jennifer Baker, the NRA public affairs director. Baker added: \"We need serious proposals to prevent violent criminals and the dangerously mentally ill from acquiring firearms. Passing a law that makes it illegal for a 20-year-old to purchase a shotgun for hunting or an adult single mother from purchasing the most effective self-defense rifle on the market punishes law-abiding citizens for the evil acts of criminals.\" CNN's Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","articles_date":"21 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/21\/politics\/jeff-flake-ar-15-age-bill\/index.html","articles_title":"Flake backs bill to raise age to buy AR-15 style weapons","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":104,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will not run for re-election, he said Tuesday in a blistering speech on the Senate floor that bemoaned the \"coarsening\" tenor of politics in the United States. Flake denounced the \"complicity\" of his own party in what he called an \"alarming and dangerous state of affairs\" under Trump, blaming the President for setting the tone. In his speech, Flake assailed a \"flagrant disregard for truth or decency\" and attacked a \"regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms.\" \"When such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is something else: It is dangerous to a democracy,\" Flake said. Flake said he did not enjoy sparring with Trump. \"If I have been critical, it's not because I relish criticizing the behavior of the President of the United States,\" Flake said. \"If I have been critical, it is because I believe that it is my obligation to do so, as a matter of duty and conscience.\" Flake went on to say that history would judge those who did not speak up. \"The notion that one should stay silent as the norms and values that keep America strong are undermined and as the alliances and agreements that ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters -- the notion that one should say and do nothing in the face of such mercurial behavior is ahistoric and, I believe, profoundly misguided.\" Flake's decision not to seek re-election means Flake joins retiring Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker as an outspoken critic of Trump with nothing to lose in the year before 2018's midterm elections.  The White House suggested it was time for Flake to retire. \"Based on the lack of support he has from the people of Arizona, it's probably a good move,\" press secretary Sarah Sanders said during the daily press briefing. In his first interview after speaking on the Senate floor, Flake refused to comment on Sanders' remarks but outlined his issues with the President to CNN's Jake Tapper. \"It's difficult to move forward in a Republican primary if you have been critical of any of the behavior that's gone on,\" Flake said on CNN's \"The Lead.\" \"We Republicans certainly can't countenance that kind of behavior. We ought to stand up and say 'This is not right. This is not us. This is not conservative.'\" Flake's political fortunes suffered as a result of his long-running feud with Trump -- which included an anti-Trump book published by Flake in the summer. Private polls conducted by Republican and Democratic groups in Arizona, sources with those groups said, showed him on track to lose badly in next August's Republican primary  to challenger Kelli Ward.  His retirement is a double-edged sword for Trump's White House: It opens the door for Flake to be replaced with a more supportive Republican. But it also provides an opportunity for Democrats to pick it up. And it turns Arizona -- once a Republican stronghold but increasingly competitive in recent elections -- into perhaps the most important state in the 2018 midterms, with Flake's seat now open and questions looming about Sen. John McCain's long-term prognosis as he is treated for brain cancer. McCain and Corker were both in attendance of Flake's Senate floor speech Tuesday and gave him a standing ovation at conclusion of his remarks -- as did Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso. \"One of the greatest people I've served with,\" Corker said after the speech, describing Flake and adding later, \"He's what I would call a real conservative.\" Corker said Flake told him about his decision after the lunch among Republican senators earlier Tuesday. When asked what it said about the Senate that Flake said he couldn't fit into the current Republican party, Barrasso said that is up to every senator to decide. \"Every senator speaks for themselves. I continue to be very privileged to represent the people of Wyoming and hope to continue to do that in the future,\" Barrasso said. Sen. John Cornyn, the second ranking Republican in the chamber, said it is \"a very sad day\" and GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who recently decided to skip a run for governor and stay in the chamber, said she was \"incredibly disappointed\" by Flake's decision. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia left the floor in tears following Flake's speech, calling it \"depressing.\" \"When someone as good and decent a person as Jeff Flake does not think he can continue in the body, it's a very tragic day for the institution,\" Kaine said.  The fight with Trump Flake's congressional career came full circle. He began in the House in 2001 as an outsider raging against earmarks. By the time he launched his Senate campaign in 2012, he was a favorite of conservative groups like the Club for Growth, which had grown in power and influence on Capitol Hill. Now, Flake is again on the outs, with Trump's populist policies taking hold with Republican voters.  In politics and personality, Trump and Flake have little in common.   Flake, a Mormon from the tiny town of Snowflake, Arizona, is polite and introspective. He journals regularly and, while in the House, regularly emailed his thoughts on travel and policy to a small, private list of family and friends.  He's long expressed major policy differences with Trump -- particularly on trade. In August he called Trump's decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership \"a big mistake which will haunt us for a long time.\" He has also defended the North American Free Trade Agreement, warning that its cancellation would badly damage the economies of border states like Arizona.  Flake refused to endorse Trump in the general election, and then three months ago published a book sharply critical of Trump titled \"Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle.\"  RELATED: In Arizona, it's Flake vs. Trump in a test of the GOP's allegiances In the book, Flake worries about \"the strange specter of an American president's seeming affection for strongmen and authoritarians.\" He also called now \"one of the more reckless periods of politics in our history.\" And he questioned whether Republicans having won the House, Senate and White House in 2016 was worth the cost of putting \"at risk our institutions and our values.\"  \"We shouldn't hesitate to speak out if the President 'plays to the base' in ways that damage the Republican Party's ability to grow and speak to a larger audience,\" Flake wrote.  Trump, meanwhile, had long plotted to oust Flake.  He told supportive Republicans in Arizona prior to the 2016 election that he would spend $10 million of his own money to see that Flake is unseated in the primary.  His White House has been in regular contact with State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, former state party chairman Robert Graham and other Republicans about the race. Former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon backed Ward even while working in the White House, and Robert Mercer, the GOP mega-donor and close Bannon ally, has given $300,000 to a pro-Ward super PAC. At an August campaign rally in Phoenix, Trump huddled backstage with DeWit, Graham and Rep. Trent Franks. Two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN it was focused on ousting Flake -- who Trump calls \"the flake.\" The fight in Arizona Flake's decision opens the door for Ward, a conservative former state senator who many Arizona Republicans see as a controversial and problematic general election candidate. But now that the seat is open, Republicans will try to recruit another candidate into the race. As Republicans look for another candidate to enter the primary, all eyes are now on DeWit, who was the Trump campaign's chief operating officer, one Arizona Republican operative said.  \"The deal is, DeWit has two days to grab the ring. It's his if he wants it, but he's got to move quick. If he wants it, everyone steps out the way. If he doesn't, chaos ensues,\" the operative, who asked for anonymity to frankly discuss the state of play, said. DeWit \"definitely has the President's support\" whereas others would have to earn it, the operative said. If DeWit doesn't run, the operative said, potential candidates include Reps. Paul Gosar and David Schweikert, as well as Christine Jones, a 2016 congressional candidate and former GoDaddy executive. Republicans have also eyed Rep. Martha McSally, and Rep. Trent Franks has been involved in conversations about ousting Flake. The winner is likely to face Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.

But while the noise about the \"amnesty\" for \"wall\" trade was the loudest, it obscured what actually would be a much more difficult fight: the President's proposed sweeping changes to the immigration system.  The Trump administration briefed reporters and supporters on its  proposal Thursday : offering a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children and asking for $25 billion for border security including infrastructure.  If that were all that was on the table, a deal might already be at hand. In fact, Democrats were mostly prepared to agree to such a proposal, which could have lined up some moderate Republicans as well.  But the deal also included two other \"pillars,\" as the White House has called them: family-based migration and the diversity visa lottery. In addition, the administration proposal included a number of \"legal loopholes\" it wants to close in the border security pillar beyond physical security -- a repackaged effort to expand federal immigration authorities.  Taken together, those efforts would amount to a dramatic reshaping of the legal immigration system -- one that will be far more complicated to negotiate on Capitol Hill.  Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas agreed Thursday before the White House announcement that the elements of the deal beyond pure border security were arguably more complicated.  \"I think they probably are,\" he said, adding that with more understanding he thought they could be negotiable. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is part of a bipartisan Senate group working to find common ground on the issue, had said earlier Thursday that while a full border wall is not acceptable, a major investment in border security is.  \"I trust big investment. I've voted for that already,\" Kaine said. \"When you can patrol a border better with drones and sensors, the wall may not be the best way. But that we would make a big investment in it? The Dems are there already.\" GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said the issue of family migration comes up if the undocumented population covered by the bill is granted citizenship -- and that leads down a difficult road.  \"if you do that, you have to address the issue of chain migration, and that's where it becomes a lot more complicated. So we've got our work cut out for us,\" Rounds said upon leaving the morning bipartisan meeting.  Thorny proposals The White House proposal would limit family sponsorship to spouses and minor children, eliminating a number of existing categories including adult children, both married and unmarried; parents of adult US citizens; and siblings of adult US citizens. Experts have estimated that cutting these categories would reduce the roughly 1 million green cards given out yearly by 25% to 50%.  At first, the Trump proposal would use the green cards from the eliminated categories -- plus the 50,000 from the eliminated diversity visa lottery -- to work through a backlog of millions of people waiting in a line upward of 30 years long for their green cards. The bill does extend an olive branch to the left in not making the cuts retroactive -- meaning anyone already in line would still be eligible. Groups on the right are outraged that the plan would mean potentially 10 to 20 years before cuts to immigration begin.  But Democrats are unlikely to accept such a sweeping cut in legal immigration at all. And cutting the diversity visa lottery is not as straightforward as some believe -- especially to members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other affinity caucuses, who are  vocal about the importance of immigration from lesser represented countries .  And the framework includes vague references to closing \"legal loopholes,\" as a White House official put it on a briefing call, as part of the border security pillar -- perhaps one of the biggest poison pills of the deal.  The White House released only a top-line overview of what it was seeking -- what it characterized as \"closing the loopholes\" to more easily detain and deport immigrants. But a document obtained by CNN that goes into more detail, which the Department of Homeland Security has been providing to lawmakers in meetings, and the descriptions released by the White House suggest it will pursue aggressive changes. In addressing \"catch-and-release,\" as the White House put it, the framework could allow detaining individuals indefinitely as they await deportation for months and years -- something that has been curtailed as the result of constitutional concerns from courts. The proposals could also vastly expand the definitions of criminal offenses that could subject an individual to deportation.  All the efforts to more aggressively deport and reject undocumented immigrants could be anathema to Democrats and some moderate Republicans.  \"I am a lot less interested in things that have the effect of distorting family relationships or splitting up families, and border security is less likely to do that,\" said Democrat Michael Bennet of Colorado, who has long pursued an immigration compromise.  \"It's crazy,\" said Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. \"This is not an easy negotiation, but we should move on the things we all agree on.\" Support for a simpler deal The realities of trying to sort through the complicated issues the White House is looking to attach to a deal on the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program are leading lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to suggest paring down the negotiations to just two pillars: DACA and physical border security.  \"We all need to understand that there are two things that are critical,\" Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, said as she was leaving the bipartisan group. \"Dealing with the Dreamers, because we're up against (a) March deadline, and dealing with border security. We all agree we need border security. We need more definitional work done on border security.\" Kaine agreed, saying there's a need to be realistic.  \"There's all kinds of issues I want to fix, I just think it's probably going to be easier to start with the two pillars,\" he said.  Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, one of the leading forces in the bipartisan group, was also vocal about a narrow approach.  \"We don't have to solve the entire problem of legal immigration in this bill,\" Alexander told CNN. \"All we really have to do is focus on the young people who were brought here illegally through no fault of their own, and border security. Sometimes taking small steps in the right direction is a good way to get where you want to go.\"","articles_date":"26 1 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/01\/26\/politics\/immigration-border-wall-daca-trump-congress\/index.html","articles_title":"Forget the wall, Trump's plan would reshape US legal immigration dramatically","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":106,"issue":5,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Former CIA Director John Brennan blasted President Donald Trump on Saturday after he tweeted about the firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, calling the President \"a disgraced demagogue.\"  \"When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will  not destroy America ... America will triumph over you,\" Brennan, who was  CIA head  under President Barack Obama, tweeted.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe on Friday, just days before he was set to receive his pension after rising through the ranks and eventually becoming the No. 2 at the bureau.  Trump tweeted in the wee hours Saturday morning about the firing, saying the axing made it \"a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.\"  \"Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\" he wrote.  The President's tweet was followed Saturday morning by his personal lawyer John Dowd's  comments  that special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian election meddling should be brought to a close. Following Dowd's remarks, Sen. Patrick Leahy again demanded Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley hold a hearing on what he called the politicization of the Justice Department. \"In the last few hours the President's personal attorney has called for the Justice Department, without even an arguably legitimate basis, to prematurely shut down the special counsel's Russia investigation,\" the Vermont Democrat said in a statement. \"And the attorney general, in a clear violation of his promised recusal under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee, fired a career civil servant days before he could retire, following months of the President's relentless and outrageous prodding.\" Leahy later added: \"I believe the Judiciary Committee will fail to fulfill its core oversight responsibility if it does nothing in this moment.\" Leahy sent a letter to Grassley in late January asking the Iowa senator to hold a hearing on the attacks on FBI and its leaders, writing: \"Never before have I been more concerned for the institutions we rely on to maintain our government's integrity than I am today.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer responded to Dowd's remarks with a statement Saturday. \"Mr. Dowd's comments are yet another indication that the first instinct of the President and his legal team is not to cooperate with special counsel Mueller, but to undermine him at every turn,\" the New York Democrat said in the statement. \"The President, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel's investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans.\" Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also responded to the news with a tweet. \"Every member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, needs to speak up in defense of the Special Counsel. Now,\"  the Virginia Democrat posted. Warner's Virginia colleague, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, also  tweeted  a warning about Dowd's remarks. \"Robert Mueller must be allowed to see this investigation through to its conclusion. Period. Full stop,\" Kaine wrote. \"We in Congress will not stand idle if he is fired, and threats like this need to stop.\" Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe reacted to Trump with a series of tweets Saturday afternoon in which he also called on Congress to protect Mueller's Russia probe. \"Delusional Donald at it again,\" McAuliffe wrote. \"With all of the chaos at the WH someone forgot to put the safety lock on the play pen when they left for the weekend.\" \"PS-Some advice: change the channel from Fox News to basketball and stop putting yourself in even more legal jeopardy,\" he tweeted.","articles_date":"17 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/17\/politics\/john-brennan-donald-trump-mccabe-firing\/index.html","articles_title":"Former CIA chief to Trump on McCabe firing: 'America will triumph over you'","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":107,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Senate Republicans have   the White House, urging President Obama to repeal his recently announced power plant rule that cajoles states into imposing cap-and-trade schemes on carbon dioxide emissions. ADVERTISEMENT Republicans say that Obama\u2019s rule is \u201call pain, no gain\u201d and would result in higher energy prices and huge job losses as coal-fired power plants and coal mines are shut down to comply with federal emissions reduction mandates. \u201cMostly, I\u2019m concerned about the American families and businesses who are going to have to deal with the severe financial effects of the President\u2019s rule. It\u2019s all pain, no gain,\u201d Louisiana Sen. David Vitter said in a statement. \u201cClearly, this Administration prioritizes pushing a far-left environmental agenda over providing affordable, reliable electricity across the country.\u201d The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s new regulation requires existing power plants reduce carbon dioxide emissions 30 percent by 2030. Different states would have to meet different emissions reductions targets, which means that coal-reliant states could be hit hardest. \u201cThis is cap-and-trade all over again, without consent by the American people, in an attempt to payoff President Obama\u2019s friends and political allies,\u201d Vitter said. Bloomberg   that Texas alone will make up one-quarter of total U.S. emissions reductions, having to cut emissions 39 percent over the next 15 years, according to the EPA\u2019s proposed rule. All this, while other coal-reliant states, Kentucky and West Virginia, will only have to reduce emissions by half as much. Kentucky and West Virginia have been some of the most vocal opponents of EPA carbon dioxide limits for new and existing power plants, which the agency   will result in 19 percent of the U.S. coal power plant capacity shutting down and coal production falling by 28 percent. \u201cThis Obama administration national energy tax would ship middle class jobs overseas, shatter our manufacturing base, and drive up energy costs for families, and especially families in Kentucky,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said in a statement. McConnell is currently locked in a tough race with Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, who has slammed McConnell for not doing enough to help coal country. Grimes has also come out against the new EPA rules. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s new EPA rule is more proof that Washington isn\u2019t working for Kentucky. Coal keeps the lights on in the Commonwealth, providing a way for thousands of Kentuckians to put food on their tables,\u201d Grimes said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in the U.S. Senate, I will fiercely oppose the President\u2019s attack on Kentucky\u2019s coal industry because protecting our jobs will be my number one priority.\u201d In West Virginia, Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall faces a tough reelection battle this year against Republican candidate Evan Jenkins who has repeatedly attacked Rahall for not fighting back against EPA rules. \u201cNick Rahall talks tough now, but for years he\u2019s backed the president\u2019s War on Coal and voted to give EPA the power and money to develop reckless regulations like these that destroy West Virginia jobs and send electricity rates skyrocketing,\u201d   Jenkins. The EPA also predicted that electricity prices will increase 6 or 7 percent by 2020 and then increase 3 percent by 2030, causing worry in some states. \u201cThese rules will effectively double the cost of electricity nationally,\u201d Eric Skrmetta, chairman of Louisiana\u2019s public service commission,   Bloomberg \u201cI have a real problem with them pretending it\u2019s not going to have an effect on electric rates,\u201d echoed Chuck Eaton, Republican chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission. \u201cThey make the rules and I\u2019m the one having to hand Georgians the bill.\u201d","articles_date":"05 06 2014","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2014\/06\/04\/forty-one-senators-push-for-repeal-obamas-cap-and-trade-rule.html","articles_title":"Forty-one senators push for repeal of Obama\u2019s cap-and-trade rule","candidate_fk":3,"first_name":"Evan","id":108,"issue":1,"last_name":"Jenkins","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"State and federal authorities are frustrated with the lack of specific details from the Department of Homeland Security about the release of immigration detainees in preparation for today\u2019s sequester.\u00a0 ADVERTISEMENT Less than a week into the new policy, ICE's response following the announcement illegal immigrants would be freed from detention centers to save money is only that \"hundreds have been released across the country.\" Lawmakers and local officials in border states want to know how many are being released, what detention centers are involved and what the cost savings goal is. A\u00a0frustrated Rep. Mike McCaul, who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, demanded answers from ICE Director John Morton by March 6. \"I am also concerned that these releases were undertaken without notification to the appropriate Congressional oversight committees,\" McCaul wrote Morton.\u00a0 Pinal County, Ariz., Sheriff Paul Babeu, Pina fired off a terse letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano Thursday demanding answers. \u201cProtocol and logic should have required your staff to formally notify me, as the top law enforcement official in the county where this occurred, about this mass release of hundreds of foreign criminals into my county and elsewhere, yet regrettably this never happened,\u201d Babeu said in the letter. While Babeu was inexplicably kept out of the loop, his colleagues in El Paso and San Diego, both highly active border regions, were informed by ICE officials ahead of the releases. El Paso Sheriff Richard Wiles said his agency was informed by ICE of their plans, but still did not know how many detainees have been released this week.\u00a0 \u201cThe release of detained undocumented immigrants to a supervised release type situation does not impact the Sheriff\u2019s Office, as we do not enforce Federal Immigration Law,\u201d Wiles said. San Diego County Sheriff William Gore was also made aware of ICE\u2019s plans in his region and like Wiles, expressed no concerns over the move. \u201cWe have a good working relationship with ICE in this area and don\u2019t see any cause for concern over the recent decision to release detainees,\u201d said Jan Caldwell, spokeswoman, Sam Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department. A forewarning of the current release policy emerged from a letter Napolitano sent to Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D- Md., chairwoman of the Committee on Appropriations, on Jan. 31, which still leaves many unanswered questions.    Napolitano told Mikulski that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would not be able to sustain current detention and removal operations or maintain the 34,000 detention beds mandated by\u00a0Congress. This would significantly roll back progress that resulted in record-high removals.    There is also concern about the prospect of cutbacks in Border Patrol agents along the border which could affect whatever progress has been made in recent years. \"U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) would not be able to maintain current staffing  levels of Border Patrol Agents and CBP Officers as mandated by Congress,\" Napolitano told\u00a0Mikulski. \"Funding and staffing reductions will increase wait times at airports, affect security between land ports of\u00a0entry, affect CBP's ability to collect revenue owed to the Federal Government, and slow\u00a0screening and entry programs for those traveling into the United States.\"  \u00a0  A freshman Congressman who knows the U.S.-Mexico border firsthand says the recent decision by the Department of Homeland Security to release low-risk detainees may actually be a solution to a festering problem. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) of El Paso, Texas, who sits on the House Committee on Homeland Security with McCaul, told  \u00a0there is bi-partisan agreement that there are too many people being detained in ICE facilities that don't belong there and that the decision this week by Napolitano to release low-risk detainees as a cost-saving measure may actually be a harbinger for where the federal immigration policy should be heading. \"The detention centers are a horribly broken element of our immigration policy,\" O'Rourke said. \"These people being released are not serious criminals and do not pose a threat to the United States.\"","articles_date":"01 03 2013","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2013\/03\/01\/frustration-confusion-mount-in-wakeice-illegal-immigrant-releases.html","articles_title":"Frustration, confusion mount in wake\u00a0ICE illegal immigrant releases","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":109,"issue":5,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) One of President Donald Trump's nominees is drawing condemnation and mockery from a Republican senator over his past statements pushing conspiracy theories and unfounded political attacks on Trump's opponents.\u00a0 CNN's KFile reported on Monday that Leandro Rizzuto Jr., Trump's nominee to be the US Ambassador to Barbados and several other Caribbean countries, frequently retweeted conspiracy theories and rumors about Sen.

Jeff Flake, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, delivered a series of verbal blows against the President while making a stop in the early primary state of New Hampshire as he continues to mull a possible GOP challenge in 2020. \"I hope that someone does run the Republican primary, somebody to challenge the President,\" he said Friday after a man in the audience asked if he'd make a White House run. \"I think the odds that I will are long, but I've not ruled it out.\" Flake's message targeted the \"Never Trump\" movement, as he sought to paint himself as a conservative alternative to the President.  \"I stand before you today, the rarest of species, the American conservative.  Americanus, Never Trumpus.  Subgenus: RINO,\" he quipped. \"There's a scurrilous rumor afoot that we're not only rare but endangered. I don't believe it.\" The senator from Arizona, who was facing a tough re-election bid and  decided not to run for a second term , spoke at the Politics & Eggs series, a must-do stop for potential presidential contenders hosted by the New England Council and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.  In the year leading up to the 2016 New Hampshire primary, 18 candidates or potential candidates spoke at the event, including Trump, who would go on to win the state's GOP primary by a landslide. Trump is set to return here Monday for an event focused on the opioid epidemic.  At the event, candidates traditionally sign wooden eggs handed out to the audience. On Friday, the eggs were already emblazoned with \"Presidential Primary NH 2020.\" Flake argued that Trump's rhetoric and style will eventually wear on the electorate and a return for civility will be in demand.  \"People I think are increasingly repulsed when the President belittles or ridicules those on the other side, refers to them as losers or clowns or makes fun of their intelligence,\" he told reporters after his speech. \"That's not a politics that plays well in New Hampshire. I hope it never does.\"  Trump, however, dominated in New Hampshire in the 2016 Republican primary, defeating a slate of other Republican candidates who were also preaching a message of civility.  But Flake is counting on the pendulum swinging away from Trump's brand in 2020. He pointed to the special election in Pennsylvania this week in which  a Democrat is poised to win a US House seat in a Republican district  that Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016, as well as other recent elections that have signaled a Democratic wave in the upcoming midterm elections.  \"We are not appealing to a broader electorate. You can drill down hard on the base, you can have a great rally and have a lot of people excited, but that doesn't translate into electoral success these days,\" he said. \"You can only drill down so hard on the base.\" In his speech, which resembled remarks he gave at the National Press Club on Thursday in Washington,  Flake described Trump as a \"chaotic\" President  who has \"no strategic brilliance\" and has damaged the country's institutions. \"It's well past time for us to put country before party. We've tried the other way for too long. We've done our worst, now it's time to do our best.\"  Flake's anti-Trump crusade this past year has marked a stunning rebuke of a president from a senator of the same party, and while some Republicans have criticized the President, none have matched the degree to which Flake has scorched Trump. His biggest complaints involve the President's attacks on the media, his track record of telling falsehoods and what Flake describes as \"dysfunctional\" leadership from the White House.   Trump has returned the fire. He told a small group of Republicans he was prepared to spend $10 million on defeating Flake in the primary, and he publicly offered support on Twitter for one of the senator's GOP challengers last year when it appeared Flake would run for re-election. He's also referred to the senator and former US congressman as \"Flake(y)\" and \"unelectable\" on Twitter. While the Democratic bench is filling up with, by some estimates, close to two dozen potential candidates, the list of possible Republican challengers is much shorter, with Flake, Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas most frequently mentioned, among others, by pundits. Of the group, Flake has been the most directly outspoken against the President. He delivered a major speech on the Senate floor targeting Trump and wrote an entire book blasting his own party for enabling Trump's success. \"Never has a party abandoned, fled its principles and deeply held beliefs so quickly as my party did in the face of the nativist juggernaut,\" he said Thursday at the National Press Club. \"We have become strangers to ourselves. Even as we pretend everything is fine.\" The last major primary challenge against a sitting president was in 1992, when former Nixon adviser Pat Buchanan unsuccessfully ran against George H.W. Bush. Any candidate who challenges Trump faces long odds. According to a poll by the University of New Hampshire, 60% of Republican primary voters say they plan to vote for Trump in the  2020 GOP primary, as of last month. Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire state GOP chairman, noted that many incumbent presidents who have drawn serious primary challenges have failed to win re-election in the end: President Lyndon Johnson in 1968, President Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Bush in 1992. \"One question is whether the purpose of the (2020) challenge will be to win or to serve as a vehicle for principled members of the party to signal disgust,\" said Cullen, who identifies as a \"proud\" Never Trumper.   Flake acknowledged that a primary bid will be a difficult fight due to the President's heavy support among the base.  \"Right now I can say this is the President's party, Republican primary voters in Arizona and elsewhere are firmly with the president by large majorities, but I do think that will change,\" he told reporters. \"As that changes, we'll see.\" CNN's Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report.

Rand Paul said Wednesday that he intends to oppose President Donald Trump's nominations of Mike Pompeo as secretary of state and Gina Haspel as the next CIA director, complicating their confirmation process in the Senate where Republicans have a very slim majority.  \"I'm perplexed by the nominations of people who loved the Iraq War so much they advocate for war with Iran,\" Paul told reporters on Capitol Hill in explaining his opposition to the nominees.  The announcement doesn't necessarily block the pair's paths to confirmation. Paul sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where Republicans hold a one-seat advantage, so if Paul carries out his threat to vote \"no\" on Pompeo -- and all Democrats vote against him -- Senate Republican leaders would need to decide if they would move the nominations to the floor without committee approval. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said that nominees can be reported out of committee for a floor vote with or without a recommendation -- and even with a negative recommendation.  \"But let us play it out,\" he said. \"I don't like to prognosticate.\" Republicans hold a narrow 51-49 advantage in the Senate, so Paul's opposition -- and possible opposition to Haspel from Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain -- means Republicans might need to rely on some support from Democrats.  Democratic aides said it was too early in the process to know if any Democrats will back either nomination. Two senators who previously voted to approve Pompeo for CIA director voiced concerns Wednesday over his nomination to the new position.  About Pompeo and Haspel, Paul said at his news conference their support for the Iraq War and Haspel's \"joyful glee\" of waterboarding prompted his move. \"To really appoint the head cheerleader for waterboarding to be head of CIA, I mean, how could you trust somebody who did that to be in charge of the CIA,\" he said. \"To read of her glee during the waterboarding is just absolutely appalling.\"  Paul's comments are a reference to Haspel  being a CIA veteran who was intricately involved in the execution of George W. Bush-era CIA interrogation programs , including those carried out at a \"black site\" prison she reportedly ran. Haspel oversaw the torture of a terror suspect   and her name was on a cable giving instructions to destroy video evidence documenting their interrogations, according to The New York Times. Paul said he has not spoken to the President about his opposition to Pompeo and Haspel, and that while he does support the President and his policies, \"Most of the people being appointed are still in favor of Iraq War,\" Paul said. \"These are the crazy neo conservatives.\" Paul noted that McCain has also voiced some misgivings, but wouldn't say if he believes the ailing senators would join him in voting against the nominees. However, \"If he were to say no, it might be enough\" to kill the nomination. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming accused Paul of \"sympathizing with terrorists\" over his opposition. \"Gina Haspel has spent her career defending the American people and homeland. @RandPaul is defending and sympathizing with terrorists,\"  she tweeted . Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, a member of the committee, predicted both Haspel and Pompeo will be confirmed and added that shoring up stability at the top of the State Department needs to happen quickly.  \"It's a very important position.\" Rubio said about the secretary of state role. \"I don't think the country is at the stage now where it can afford to go for months without stability there. That is a vacancy that needs to be filled. My sense is that irrespective of the vote in committee, it will be brought to the floor for the whole body to weigh in.\" Where key committee Democrats stand Democrats also highlighted their issues with Pompeo on Wednesday. New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, one of two Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that voted last year to confirm Pompeo to be CIA director, told CNN she now has \"concerns.\" \"What does he propose for a solution in Syria?\" she asked. \"How is he going to support our diplomatic efforts and negotiations on North Korea? What's he going to do about State Department budget and personnel? Is he going to lift the hiring freeze? I think there are a whole list of things that I am very worried about.\" \"I'm going to wait and give Mike Pompeo the opportunity to answer those kinds of questions and see what he has to say,\" she added.  Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the other Democrat on the committee who voted a year ago for Pompeo, told CNN on Wednesday he has \"a lot of concerns\" about elevating him to be secretary of state.  \"I have very serious concerns because chief diplomat is a very different position than being head of the intel agency,\" Kaine said in an interview in the Capitol. \"His statements about a number of things make me really worried about whether he will bring the right philosophy to the job.\" While GOP leaders could still move the nomination to the full Senate for a vote -- where Pompeo might be able to get at least 51 votes to be confirmed -- failing to be approved by the committee could politically damage him, especially when an influential Democrat like Kaine who once backed him turns negative.  \"Opposition to the Iran deal is one thing. That wouldn't slow me down,\" Kaine said. \"But his notion, 'oh you know, a couple of thousand sorties, we could wipe them out with all our coalition allies.' I don't think we need more fire and fury in the secretary of state's office.\" Kaine was referring to a 2014 comment Pompeo made to a roundtable of reporters as the Obama administration and allies were in the final days of talks over curbing Iran's nuclear program.  Pompeo said that it would take \"under 2,000 sorties to destroy the Iranian nuclear capacity. This is not an insurmountable task for the coalition forces.\" Kaine said he has not made a final decision about how he will vote.  \"I want to listen to the hearings.  But I have a lot of concerns,\" he said. UPDATE: This story has been updated after the New York Times issued a  correction  stating that Haspel did not oversee the torture of Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah who was waterboarded 83 times in one month.

Bush will attend a fundraiser this weekend in support of a Republican candidate for governor of Virginia, Ed Gillespie. The fundraiser will take place in Dallas, where the former president lives, and is expected to draw many big-money donors. Gillespie served as a top aide to Bush during his time in the White House and was chairman of the Republican National Committee. The former president has largely stayed away from politics since leaving office. He has rarely campaigned or raised money for any candidates aside from his brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. \"Ed will travel to Dallas this week to raise money for his campaign. He's proud to have the support of President Bush and conservative leaders from across the commonwealth and the country,\" said Abbi Sigler, a Gillespie spokeswoman. \"This is a crucial campaign for Virginia Republicans, and Ed will work tirelessly to ensure we have the resources necessary to defeat Ralph Northam or Tom Perriello in November, and bring conservative leadership back to Richmond.\" The fundraiser comes at a time when Gillespie has pulled away from the pack in a field of Republicans hoping to secure the GOP nomination. A  new poll  from Christopher Newport University shows Gillespie with a sizable lead in the primary over Corey Stewart, the chair of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors and State Senator Frank Wagner. However, more than a third of Republicans -- 38% -- remain undecided. The Roanoke Times  first reported the news of the fundraiser. Stewart once served as the chair of Donald Trump's presidential campaign in Virginia before being fired. His Trump-style campaign which includes tagging Gillespie with the moniker \"Establishment Ed\" because of his lengthy career in Washington has not yet caught on. Democrats have a fierce primary battle of their own in Virginia. Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, who enjoys the support of all of Virginia's top elected democratic officials, is locked in a tight battle with former Congressman Tom Perriello. That same CNU poll shows the Democratic race is a tie. While Northam has the support of the Virginia Democratic infrastructure behind him, led by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Perriello has pitched himself as the more authentic progressive -- highlighted by the revelation in The  New York Times  that before Northam became a candidate he voted for George W. Bush twice. ","articles_date":"28 3 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/03\/28\/politics\/george-w-bush-ed-gillespie-fundraiser\/index.html","articles_title":"George W.

On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam is on track to win the nomination for Virginia governor, CNN has projected. Gillespie's tight victory over Prince William County Board of Supervisors chair Corey Stewart came as a major surprise. Observers initially expected it to be an easy win for Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. Frank Wagner, a senator in the commonwealth's legislature, trailed in third place. Meanwhile, Northam's win capped off fierce competition on the Democratic side, where he faced off against former congressman Tom Perriello. And turnout in the Democratic primary far outpaced the Republican side. In a statement congratulating Northam, outgoing Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe linked the Republican field to President Donald Trump. Tuesday's elections marked the first time both parties held contests on the same day in the commonwealth's history. A fierce fight Stewart's surprise performance came after a campaign during which he engendered significant controversy. Last October, he  appeared on a show  hosted by Mike Cernovich, a member of the pro-Trump, far-right media who has dismissed the existence of date rape. Two months ago, Stewart  participated  in an \"ask me anything\" session on Reddit's largest pro-Trump forum, where, among other things, he called Gillespie a \"cuckservative.\" He had previously served as the Trump campaign chair for Virginia before  being fired  from the unpaid position. Gillespie, a former George W. Bush aide, campaigned off the goodwill he established with Republicans after his narrow loss to Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in 2014. Gillespie worked to tiptoe around the presence of Trump, embracing policies that are popular with Republicans without directly tying his campaign to the President. Gillespie basically ignored his competition, including the flame-throwing Stewart, and the strategy seemed to work. Most polls showed Gillespie with a double-digit lead before Election Day.  A third candidate, Wagner, struggled to gain traction, despite winning the endorsement of The Washington Post's editorial board. For Democrats, the race had been framed as a  reboot  of the Bernie Sanders-Hillary Clinton contest.  Some viewed the  close battle as a pitting  of the Sanders wing of the party, as channeled by Perriello, against the Clinton wing of the party, represented by Northam. But the comparison was never a perfect fit. Northam had pushed his campaign further to the left and has described Trump as a narcissistic maniac -- while Perriello instead attempted to reach out to Trump voters by selling a message of economic populism framed through a progressive perspective. Both the Democratic and Republican contests featured  established  candidates with lengthy political careers facing off against insurgent, populist candidates hoping to upset the power bases of their respective parties.

Even if they did, they'd still need another nine Democrats to reach the magic number of 60. Here's a breakdown of the Republican \"no\" votes and where Democrats stand.

It leaves unfunded Community Health Centers that thousands of Delawareans rely on for basic health needs.

Gary Peters (Michigan) --  \"I am encouraged that members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have expressed a willingness to negotiate bipartisan solutions to these pressing issues.

Ron Wyden (Oregon) --  \"There is a bipartisan solution on DACA and many other important issues before Congress including funding for Secure Rural Schools, deadly wildfires and other natural disasters.

Tina Smith (Minnesota) --  \"Our great country cannot be run a month at a time.

It leaves unfunded Community Health Centers that thousands of Delawareans rely on for basic health needs.

Gary Peters (Michigan) --  \"I am encouraged that members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have expressed a willingness to negotiate bipartisan solutions to these pressing issues.

Chris Van Hollen (Maryland) --  \"We could avoid a government shutdown by sitting down and coming to an agreement that would get the support of a majority of both sides.

Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs Peter Kadzik, who essentially serves as the Justice Department's lobbyist to Congress, sent the email in question to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta from a private Gmail account on May 19 last year with the subject line, \"Heads up.\" \"There is a (House Judiciary Committee) oversight hearing today where the head of our Civil Division will testify,\" he wrote. \"Likely to get questions on State Department emails.\" \"Another filing in the (Freedom of Information Act) case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails,\" he added. Tim Kaine: James Comey's actions are 'making our folks mad' The exchange is one of tens of thousands of emails stolen from Podesta's Gmail account and published by WikiLeaks in recent weeks. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of any of the emails, and the Clinton campaign has so far declined to verify individual emails. The Department of Justice declined to respond to questions regarding the email, and Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri, who was among the officials to whom Podesta forwarded the email in 2015, also declined to comment when asked by a reporter aboard Clinton's campaign plane. The email plays into Republican candidate Donald Trump's long-running narrative that Clinton and her entourage belong to a corrupt political elite seeking to exert influence at the Justice Department. Over the summer, days before the FBI announced it had completed its investigation into the private server, Bill Clinton met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch aboard her government plane, sparking accusations of a conflict of interest. Trump was quick to raise the Kadzik email during a campaign rally in Florida Wednesday afternoon, calling Kadzik \"a close associate of John Podesta.\" \"These are the people that want to run our country, folks,\" Trump said to a chorus of boos. \"The spread of political agendas into Justice Department -- there's never been a thing like this that has happened in our country's history -- is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country.\" The legal filing referenced in the second part of Kadzik's email had been submitted to the court a day before Kadzik sent it, and had already been reported on in the media. But Kadzik's phrasing, and his decision to write from his personal email account, gives the impression he was passing the information along as an informal tip, not knowing whether it had been filed. Read more: Turmoil in the FBI Information about the congressional hearing was also publicly available. Podesta later forwarded Kadzik's note to Clinton's other senior campaign staff with the comment, \"Additional chances for mischief,\" though it wasn't clear to whom or what he was referring. The conversation suggests Kadzik may have felt inclined to keep Podesta informed about developments at the Department of Justice that related to the fledgling campaign. The FOIA case in question involved the State Department, not the campaign, and Podesta was not directly involved in the legal proceedings. Kadzik previously worked for Podesta as a lawyer, and additional emails released by WikiLeaks suggest the two men were friends. For example, in January, Kadzik and his wife emailed to wish Podesta a happy birthday and invite him to dinner next time he was in town. Kadzik's wife, Amy Weiss, worked in the White House in the late 1990s when Podesta was then-President Bill Clinton's chief of staff. It's unclear how Kadzik learned of the FOIA filing, which was submitted by Department of Justice attorneys representing the State Department in ongoing lawsuits. Despite Trump's assertions to the contrary, Kadzik was not directly involved in the FBI's investigation into Clinton's private email server, nor is he involved in its current review of emails found on a computer belonging to the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The stolen email is one of several published by WikiLeaks in recent weeks that raise questions about the coziness between the Clinton campaign and government officials. Last month, the group  published  an email in which Brian Fallon -- a former spokesman for the Department of Justice now working for the Clinton campaign -- indicated he has spoken with \"DOJ folks\" about pending FOIA litigation. And on Wednesday, an email emerged showing communication between a State Department spokeswoman and top Clinton aides about how the State Department would respond to reports about the former Secretary's emails. This particular exchange was from March 1, 2015 -- one day before Clinton's private server was first revealed by The New York Times, and about a month before the official launch of her presidential campaign. The spokeswoman outlined the State Department's response to the upcoming report, indicating that the press office had incorporated input from the Clinton aides. The email was forwarded to Palmieri, who in turn forwarded it to Podesta. \"You may have already heard from other channels, but NYT will have a story tomorrow on HRC's Benghazi emails,\" Palmieri wrote, along with speculation about how the reporter learned of the server. \"Better now than April,\" she added.","articles_date":"2 11 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/11\/02\/politics\/peter-kadzik-john-podesta-wikileaks\/index.html","articles_title":"Hacked email appears to show DOJ official tipping Clinton campaign about review","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":119,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN) Heather Heyer once  posted on Facebook  an anonymous quote that resonated after her violent death: \"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention,\" the quote, displayed on a purple background, reads. Her mother made that a call to action Wednesday in a memorial service for the 32-year-old Charlottesville paralegal, who was killed Saturday when  a car hit her and other counterprotesters  who opposed a \"Unite the Right\" rally of white nationalists. \"They tried to kill my child to shut her up. Well, guess what? You just magnified her,\" Susan Bro said to loud applause Wednesday at the city's roughly 1,000-seat Paramount Theater. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and US Sen. Tim Kaine joined her relatives, friends and others for the late-morning public service in a city still coming to grips with Saturday's protest. Heyer's friends have said she joined the counterprotesters to oppose racism and injustice. Her mother pointed to the Facebook message that Heyer posted in November. \"I want you to pay attention, find what's wrong ... and say to yourself, what can I do to make a difference?\" Bro said. \"And that's how you're going to make my child's death worthwhile. \"I'd rather have my child, but by golly, if I've got to give her up, we're going to make it count.\" McAuliffe after the service called for healing, reconciliation, and further moves past bigotry and racism. \"We need to come together as Heather's mother spoke about,\" he told reporters outside the theater. \"To make her life impactful, we need to move forward.\" 'She wanted equality' Heyer, a paralegal at the Charlottesville-based Miller Law Group, had told co-workers Friday that she was going to be among the counterprotesters rallying against the \"Unite the Right\" groups. She was walking along or across a street when a Dodge Challenger slammed into pedestrians and another car. Heyer was killed, and 19 others were injured.  Police arrested James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Ohio,   that afternoon after they found the damaged Challenger. He is being held without bail and faces one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death. At Wednesday's service, her father, Mark Heyer, choked up as he spoke of his daughter. \"She wanted equality, and in this issue of the day of her passing, she wanted to put down hate,\" Heyer said. \"And for my part, we just need to stop all this stuff and just forgive each other. I think that's what the Lord would want us to do.\" The racial diversity of those in the auditorium, he said, reflected Heather's embrace of people of all colors. \"It didn't matter who you were or where you from,\" Mark Heyer said. \"If she loved you, that was it -- you were stuck. For that, I'm truly proud of my daughter.\" Many wore purple -- a color she loved. \"Purple is a symbol of openness -- It basically lets other people know, 'I'm willing to work with you.' That's something that Heather was,\" her supervisor Alfred Wilson told CNN's \"New Day\" before the gathering. \"She was a person that was willing to work with anyone,\" Wilson, wearing a suit and a purple bow tie, said. \"She was a very kind, generous person, and someone that actually was very opinionated and spoke up for what she believed was right.\" Friend: She was afraid protesters would be violent Heyer was nervous about counterprotesting on Saturday, but felt she needed to be there to stand up what she believed in, her co-worker and friend Victoria Jackson told CNN a day before the service.  One of the last conversations they had before each left for the weekend was about the rally. \"Heather said, 'I want to go so badly but I don't want to get shot.  I don't want to die,' \" Jackson remembered. Heyer was afraid of the protesters because she believed they were not here for peace, her co-worker said.    'Defending the rights of others' Heyer was, a family friend said at Wednesday's service, \"a young woman who lost her life defending the rights of others.\" \"I would like for us to carry her legacy on by doing the same thing: Respecting the rights of everyone,\" Cathy Brinkley said. The Rev. Alvin Edwards, pastor at Mount Zion First African Baptist Church, said people should learn from Heyer that they should make each day count. \"She lived her life (in a way) that enabled her to fight for justice and righteousness,\" Edwards said. As a paralegal, Heyer assisted clients through the bankruptcy filing process. She had just celebrated her five-year anniversary with the firm last week.    Wilson, her supervisor, said she easily empathized with people who would come in to file for bankruptcy protection. \"I pray and ask that (you) can somehow, some way feel the love that she had. ... She saw the good in everyone,\" Wilson said at the service. CNN's Rosa Flores reported from Charlottesville. CNN's Jason Hanna and Steve Almasy wrote in Atlanta.

Brian Sandoval in Las Vegas. \"And I'm announcing today that in this form, I simply will not support it.\" Almost immediately, the pro-Trump group America First Policies decided to launch what a source with the group says will be a major television, radio and digital ad buy against Heller -- a remarkable attack on a member of Trump's own party whose seat is endangered in 2018. It was not immediately clear whether the group intends to back a primary challenger to Heller.  Heller, like four other GOP senators who announced their opposition to the Obamacare repeal bill that was unveiled Thursday, left the door open to negotiations. But he said \"it's going to be very difficult to get me to a 'yes'\" on the bill.  GOP Senate leaders can only lose two members of their 52-senator caucus in support of the bill in order for it to pass. Heller said he spoke with Senate Republican leaders and Vice President Mike Pence on Friday morning. RELATED: Here's where Republican senators stand on the health care bill Heller said it is a \"lie\" that the Senate Republican health care bill would lower premiums.  \"There isn't anything in this bill that would lower premiums,\" he said.  Heller, a Republican who is up for re-election in 2018, is the Democrats' top target in the upcoming cycle. Already, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen is preparing to challenge him. He said the changes he is seeking to the bill would go in the opposite direction of those sought by other current \"no\" votes -- conservative hard-liners including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Utah Sen. Mike Lee. Sandoval, a Republican who decided to opt into expanding Medicaid, said 210,000 received health coverage because of the decision. He said the state's uninsured rate declined from 23% before the Affordable Care Act to 11 or 12% afterward.  Sandoval specifically pointed to people who were making a little more than $16,000 per year. \"These are our friends, these are our families, and these are our neighbors. ... They are living healthier and happier lives because of that decision -- I don' think that can be overstated enough.\"  Sandoval said he would do \"everything in my power\" to make sure those people can maintain the quality of life they currently have. He thanked Heller for working \"hand in hand\" with him. Sandoval also asked if it's \"really realistic\" for people earning $16,000 per year to buy insurance on the exchange if they lose Medicaid eligibility.  He pulled out the Senate Republican bill. \"There's still an opportunity to make this bill better,\" he said.  This story has been updated.

As the President's meeting Tuesday showed, there are many lawmakers jockeying to make sure their plans advance, making it difficult to keep track of who's running the show.  Here are the key players that have taken the lead: Congressional leadership vs. 'Gang of Six' In just one effort to streamline the process, the four second-in-command\u00a0congressional leaders --\u00a0 Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn,\u00a0Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy  and  House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer \u00a0-- got together Wednesday afternoon to try to\u00a0sort through the efforts. \"We are not going to default to existing groups. There were too many groups to count and they were basically getting nowhere,\" Cornyn told reporters. \"So that's why, I think, the need to move to this level.\" Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican member of another group, says it's his \"Gang of Six\" with Durbin that's leading the way. \"Somebody has to put forward a document. Somebody has to put forward a bill,\" he said. \"That's what we're doing.\" Durbin says the \"Gang of Six\" group is close to a deal, and as for a meeting of the congressional No. 2's, Durbin said it was \"very difficult\" to imagine that separate group would produce a product, and was visibly exasperated by the topics discussed.  He sighed, laughed and looked up at the ceiling when asked if the meeting earlier Wednesday in McCarthy's office was mostly to come up with a meeting schedule.  \"Yes, that's exactly what it is. They're going to start with a staff meeting at 3:30 (Thursday) afternoon. To talk about an agenda,\" he said, half laughing, half sighing. \"We've been at this for months. I'm going, we're participating.\" In the Senate  Bipartisans: \u00a0The \"Gang of Six\" consists of six senators from across the aisle that have been working on a DACA deal for months. Because the Senate needs Democrats to pass a deal, they've been working towards a proposal that we could get members on board from both parties.\u00a0 The group is led by\u00a0 Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham\u00a0 and\u00a0 Durbin , who\u00a0together\u00a0introduced a bill last year that would allow immigrants who\u00a0came to the country illegally as children to earn lawful permanent residence and eventually American citizenship. Also in the gang are senators from states with large immigrant populations, including the two senators from Colorado --\u00a0 Democrat \u00a0 Michael Bennet \u00a0and\u00a0 Republican \u00a0 Cory Gardner . One border state -- Arizona -- is represented in the group with\u00a0 Flake , who's played a vocal role in demanding a bipartisan process.  Democratic\u00a0Sen. Bob\u00a0Menendez \u00a0of New Jersey recently joined the group, bringing the total to six. All members were part of the 2013 immigration \"Gang of Eight,\" with the exception of Gardner, who was not in the Senate at the time.\u00a0 It's clear they're unlikely to get support from senators on the farther ends of the political spectrum\u00a0-- especially on the right. Asked if he could support a deal produced by this group, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz gave a flat \"no.\" \"Passing an amnesty bill that continues 'chain migration' and has only fig leaf token efforts at border security, would be a serious mistake,\" he said.\u00a0 Right flank:\u00a0 Those unsatisfied with compromises being made in the Gang of Six are taking a more hardline approach.\u00a0 Cornyn \u00a0heads up an all-Republican working group that includes\u00a0 Sens. Chuck Grassley \u00a0of Iowa,\u00a0 Tom Cotton \u00a0of Arkansas,  David Perdue \u00a0of Georgia,\u00a0 Thom Tillis \u00a0of North Carolina, and\u00a0 James Lankford \u00a0of Oklahoma.\u00a0They're focusing on\u00a0family-based migration, the diversity lottery system, and bolstered border security -- which includes a number of other controversial\u00a0immigration enforcement provisions. They're attempting to craft a proposal that would first pass the House, which would only require a simple majority of votes, rather than the 60 votes needed to advance a bill in the Senate. \"It's not just about 60 votes,\" Tillis said. \"It's 50% plus one in the House, and I don't want to make a point to say the Senate's ready to go. I want to make the difference in providing certainty to the DACA population and a more secure border.\" Left flank: \u00a0Progressive Democrats, meanwhile, have been a vocal and active force in the debate. They're demanding a clean DACA bill now with no border security provisions attached -- an unlikely situation. Some of the most visible senators include many of the potential contenders for the Democratic presidential primary in 2020, like  Sens.\u00a0Kamala Harris \u00a0of California,\u00a0whose state is home to the most DACA residents of any single state,\u00a0 Bernie Sanders \u00a0of Vermont and\u00a0 Elizabeth Warren \u00a0of Massachusetts.\u00a0 In the House Bipartisans :\u00a0While there's no formal bipartisan \"gang\" in the House, there are multiple members who've been working across the aisle to find a solution. Texas\u00a0 Republican Rep. Will Hurd , on Monday unveiled a proposal with a bipartisan partner,\u00a0 Congressional Hispanic Caucus Whip Pete Aguilar , that focused on border security and DACA alone, without any spending deal component. Other efforts include bipartisan talks through the Problem Solvers Caucus. Like in the Senate, Republicans with heavy immigrant populations in their state are taking a lead, including\u00a0Colorado  Rep. Mike Coffman \u00a0and\u00a0Florida  Rep. Carlos Curbelo \u00a0-- who has gone so far as to join Democrats in saying he won't support government spending without a DACA resolution. The Problem Solvers effort is also being shaped by co-chairmen\u00a0New Jersey  Democrat\u00a0Rep. Josh\u00a0Gottheimer\u00a0 and\u00a0New York  Republican Rep. Tom Reed. Right flank :\u00a0A group of House conservatives introduced their own proposal on immigration on Wednesday at the helm of  Reps.\u00a0Bob Goodlatte \u00a0of Virginia and\u00a0 Raul Labrador\u00a0 of   Idaho\u00a0--\u00a0a heavily conservative plan.\u00a0The bill comes from a handful of members from a working group arranged by House Speaker Paul Ryan and includes a wish-list of conservative requests on immigration. Also key in this group are\u00a0 Reps. Martha McSally \u00a0of Arizona and\u00a0 Mike McCaul \u00a0of Texas.\u00a0The goal of the group is to keep Republican leadership focused on the demands of the conservative base and pull negotiations to the right. Left flank:\u00a0 The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, especially its vocal chairwoman\u00a0 Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham \u00a0and longtime immigration advocate firebrand\u00a0Illinois  Rep. Luis Gutierrez , have been instrumental in keeping Democratic leadership checked in with the base on the left. The group has been seeking to hold leadership's feet to the fire on not giving up any leverage or on poison pills -- including by publicly storming the office of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer shortly before the December recess to demand senators hold the line in spending talks.\u00a0 This story has been updated.

While the recess is meant for members to get in touch with their voters, many are finding out the hard way that their constituents are unhappy with the state of Washington. Over the weekend, a number of members of Congress faced criticism and jeers at their town halls. Republican Rep. Ryan Costello experienced both  cheers and boos  during his 80-minute session with 200 attendees in West Chester, Pennsylvania Saturday. On Monday, Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina had to wait 30 seconds for crowd chants of \"you lie\" to die down, after Wilson told the crowd he had supported the local solicitor.  Earlier this year, California Rep.

Republicans can only afford to lose two of their 52 senators for the bill to pass. As of Monday, most Republicans are still reviewing the text, but here is what many have said so far: Opposes in current form but open to negotiations: 6\u00a0 Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) --\u00a0 Collins announced that she will vote \"no\" on a motion to proceed to the bill. \"I want to work w\/ my GOP & Dem colleagues to fix the flaws in ACA. CBO analysis shows Senate bill won't do it. I will vote no on mtp, CBO says 22 million people lose insurance; Medicaid cuts hurt most vulnerable Americans; access to healthcare in rural areas threatened. Senate bill doesn't fix ACA problems for rural Maine. Our hospitals are already struggling. 1 in 5 Mainers are on Medicaid\" (A series of tweets on 6\/26) Sen. Dean Heller (Nevada) --  Heller also plans to vote against a motion to proceed and said that the Senate Republican health care bill \"is not the answer. It's simply not the answer. And I'm announcing today that in this form, I simply will not support it. (Comments made at a news conference 6\/23) Sen. Rand Paul (Kentucky) --  Paul told reporters on 6\/26 that he will vote against a motion to proceed to the bill.    \"They've promised too much.\u00a0 They say they're going to fix health care and premiums are going to down.\u00a0 There's no way the Republican bill brings down premiums.\u00a0 Look, I've been in medicine 20 years.\u00a0 I'm 54 years old.\u00a0 Premiums have never gone down.\u00a0 They're not going to go down after the Republican bill.\u00a0 And it's a false, sort of over-promising to say, oh, yes, insurance premiums are going to go down.\u00a0 But we're keeping 10 of the 12 mandates that caused the prices to go up.\u00a0 It's a foolish notion to promise something you can't provide.\" (Interview with ABC'S \"This week\" on 6\/25) Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas)  -- Cruz told CNN on 6\/27 that he is continuing to discuss with McConnell the many reforms he has been advocating in the health care working group for several months. Asked if he still a \"no\" on the bill he said \"it continues to be a work in progress.\"    Sen. Ron Johnson (Wisconsin) --  Johnson told CNN on 6\/26 that he will vote \"no\" on a motion to proceed. \"If leader McConnell says failure is not an option, don't set yourself up for failure,\" he told reporters earlier in the day.  \"I want the time to consider this thoroughly, to allow my constituents in Wisconsin a chance to review it, provide their valuable input and feedback,\" he said on 6\/27 on Fox News. \"I'm not asking much, but let's take a couple weeks. Let's be thoughtful about this.\" Sen. Mike Lee (Utah) -- \u00a0\"Currently, for a variety of reasons, we are not ready to vote for this bill, but we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor. There are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current health care system, but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs.\" (Joint paper statement with Johnson on 6\/22) Lee and Johnson are both asking for states to have more flexibility in designing their own health care systems. While they came out against the current version of the bill Thursday, a Lee  statement Friday night  and a Johnson op-ed  published Monday morning  had more specific requests. Still reviewing but has concerns: 4   Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio)\u00a0--  \"There are some promising changes to reduce premiums in the individual insurance market, but I continue to have real concerns about the Medicaid policies in this bill, especially those that impact drug treatment at a time when Ohio is facing an opioid epidemic. I look forward to examining this new proposal carefully and reviewing the analysis by the Congressional Budget Office when it is available. If the final legislation is good for Ohio, I will support it. If not, I will oppose it. As this process moves forward, I will continue to work to protect Ohio's interests and ensure that our health care system works better for all Ohioans.\" (Paper statement on 6\/22) Sen. John McCain (Arizona)  -- \"I've been talking with the governor (Republican Doug Ducey), and we're having conversations, and we will go through the whole bill together, and we will have time to discuss it and decide. ... Right now the governor's initial impression is that it's not helpful to his state. We're going to continue to have conversations, we're going to listen to the debate, and decide.\" (To CNN on 6\/26) Sen.

This is big stuff, and so making sure that we get it right is something that I have said is an imperative.\" ( Interview with CNN on 6\/26 ) Sen. Cory Gardner (Colorado) -- \u00a0Told reporters \"we need to learn more and get the information and numbers behind it....That's not a no. It's not a yes.\u00a0We have to look at the numbers.\" (To reporters on 6\/22) Sen. Bill Cassidy (Louisiana) --  Cassidy told reporters on 6\/26 he was still reviewing the CBO report.

I'll spend a lot of time on it this weekend.\" (To reporters on 6\/22) Sen. Thad Cochran (Mississippi) --  His spokesman told CNN on 6\/23 he was still reviewing the bill.  Sen. Steve Daines (Montana) --  Daines has said he's waiting to hear from constituents before making a decision. \"What Montanans have told me they want to see, first and foremost, is a reduction in premiums, the affordability question. Number two, taking care of those with pre-existing conditions, that they have access to care and affordable care. And number three, very important for Montana is, we are one of the Medicaid expansion states, is that we save Medicaid and protect Medicaid.\" (Interview on 6\/23 with the  Billings Gazette )  Sen. Deb Fischer (Nebraska) --  \"You know we are establishing the health care bill now, we just received the text of it a day ago, then we are going to review it and the debate will begin on Monday.\" ( Statement on 6\/24 in Grand Island, Nebraska )  Sen. Ben Sasse (Nebraska) --  \"So this is not a full repeal or full replace piece of legislation, and that's dictated by a whole bunch of circumstances. So we are having a conversation about something that's much smaller than that. This is largely a Medicaid reform package, and I'm about 40% of the way through reading the bill. I got a copy of it Thursday midday. And I'm not finished reading it so I don't have anything to say about the particulars of any vote right now.\" (Comments on 6\/25 during a Q&A in Colorado Springs at the Koch donor conference) Sen.

Then, I'm going to stay focused on it next week as the bill goes to the Senate floor -- where it will be subject to virtually unlimited amendments -- and my focus will be on how it affects Tennesseans.\" ( Statement  on 6\/22) Appears supportive, leaning toward yes: 16 Sen.

Roger Wicker (Mississippi) --  \"In almost every regard, this draft legislation represents another step to move us away from the unworkable aspects of Obamacare and toward a smaller government approach. If enacted, Americans would be far better off than they are under the failing Obamacare status quo.\" ( Statement  on 6\/22)  Sen. Richard Burr (North Carolina) --  \"This draft legislation outlines a number of initiatives that are good for North Carolina. While not perfect, the bill does provide the funding we need to support our most vulnerable North Carolinians.\" ( Statement  on 6\/22) Sen.

Mike Enzi (Wyoming) --  \"After months of hard work, Senate Republicans are proposing solutions to address the challenges to health care created by Obamacare that are affecting millions of hardworking families.\" ( Statement  on 6\/22) CNN's MJ Lee, Maeve Reston, Lauren Fox, Manu Raju, Phil Mattingly, Kristin Wilson, Emily Karl, and Ryan Nobles contributed to this report.

Here are some highlights so far: \u2022 Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, kicked off the hearing by declaring that \u201cwhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured.\u201d Mr. Walden floated the prospect of regulation, saying that \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201d \u2022 Mr. Walden also asked: \u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d The definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency. \u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201d \u2022 Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would agree or refuse to change Facebook\u2019s default settings to minimize collection and use of users\u2019 data. \u201cThis is a complex issue that deserves more than a one-word answer,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThat\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Mr. Pallone responded. \u2022 California Democrat Anna Eshoo put it more bluntly, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cAre you willing to change your business model to protect users\u2019 privacy?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg was noncommittal, saying: \u201cCongresswoman, I\u2019m not sure what that means.\u201d \u2022 Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk. Mr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is \u201ca neutral public platform.\u201d \u201cI do agree that we should give people a voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u2022 Rep. Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s promise to give users worldwide the same privacy controls required by a tough new data protection law which will go into effect in the European Union next month. Mr. Green also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if Facebook planned to comply with the provision in the European law that allows individuals to obtain a copy of the data companies hold about them. \u2022 A number of lawmakers have tried to draw a comparison between the Obama campaign\u2019s use of a Facebook app to scrape data from users and their friends in 2012 and Cambridge Analytica. Those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign\u2019s app and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for. The app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, made an appearance on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d and  weighed in on the Facebook controversy . Mr. Musk told co-host Gayle King: Andrew writes: These were the most important words from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s five-hour testimony: \u201cI agree we are responsible for the content.\u201d They may come back to haunt him, given his previous rejection of calling Facebook a publisher. He later backtracked and called his business a tech company, but his acknowledgment may fundamentally shift the conversation \u2014 and how the company operates. (All in all, Mr. Zuckerberg did better than anyone had expected.) More from  Peter Eavis : Critics\u2019 corner \u2022  Paul Pendergrass  writes, \u201cIf Mr. Zuckerberg can convince lawmakers and users that he is the most capable and determined person to fix his company\u2019s problems, then the company can start turning the corner on this crisis.\u201d \u2022  Kara Swisher of Recode  tweeted that Mr. Zuckerberg won yesterday\u2019s hearing \u201cnot because he was so good (he was fine if a little flat), but because the senators really dropped every single ball possible.\u201d \u2022  Sara Fischer and Dan Primack of Axios  write, \u201cMark Zuckerberg on Tuesday morphed from a shy tech nerd into a confident business executive who ran circles around lawmakers.\u201d \u2022  Shira Ovide of Gadfly  writes: \u201cZuckerberg believes he\u2019s giving users control, but he\u2019s giving them the illusion of control. And that means the consent of Facebook users is not informed.\u201d Elsewhere in Facebook:  Robert and Rebekah Mercer have  tried to mend fences  with the tech giant on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Some user data obtained by the quiz app behind the scandal  included private messages . Facebook  collects more info about you  than you realized. And  could Instagram help bail out  its parent company? That\u2019s the question Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba,  said he is struggling currently to understand . But that relationship will change over the next two decades, Mr. Ma said: Mr. Ma goes on to write: Shares of CBS are down 1.9 percent and Viacom\u2019s stock is off nearly 1 percent after  CNBC reported  that Shari Redstone is likely to replace Les Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, if a deal isn\u2019t reached with Viacom.

Bank of America said  it would stop lending money  to companies that make military-inspired firearms for civilians, such as AR-15-style rifles.

Trump \u2019s ascent has caused within the  Republican Party , hoping to gain the support of Republican voters and party leaders including former elected officials and retired generals disillusioned by their party\u2019s standard-bearer. The efforts come after the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, on Thursday said he was  \u201cjust not ready\u201d to back Mr. Trump , comments the Clinton campaign giddily blasted out in an email and on social media. At the same time, Priorities USA Action, a \u201c super PAC \u201d supporting Mrs. Clinton, intends to reach out to Republican megadonors disillusioned by their party\u2019s presumptive nominee. More broadly, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign is repositioning itself, after a year of emphasizing liberal positions and focusing largely on minority voters, to also appeal to independent and Republican-leaning white voters turned off by Mr. Trump. With the Democratic nomination in sight, Mrs. Clinton has broadened her economic message, devoted days to apologizing for a comment she previously made that angered working-class whites, and pledged that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who remains widely popular among the blue-collar voters drawn to Mr. Trump, would \u201ccome out of retirement and be in charge\u201d of creating jobs in places that have been particularly hard hit. The effort is a striking turn after she spent the past year trying to mobilize the liberal wing and labor leaders in the Democratic Party. But her campaign, confident that the young people and liberals backing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will come around to support Mrs. Clinton in November, is focusing its efforts on white working-class women and suburban women who tend to vote for Republican presidential candidates, but who polls show hold negative views of Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m here because I want you to know whether people vote for me or not, whether they yell at me or not, it\u2019s not going to affect what I will do to help,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told residents at a health clinic here on Monday, as protesters\u2019 chants outside of \u201cHillary, go home!\u201d could be heard. The campaign expects to assemble a \u201cRepublicans for Hillary\u201d group, and Mrs. Clinton has, from her days in the Senate and as secretary of state, cultivated strong relationships with prominent Republicans and their top staff members. Mark Salter, a top adviser to Senator John McCain, this week  expressed his support for Mrs. Clinton on Twitter  minutes after Mr. Trump clinched his party\u2019s nomination. Mrs. Clinton has also enjoyed a strong relationship with former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, a Republican, who described her as \u201ca superb representative of the United States all over the world.\u201d In the past, Mrs. Clinton has praised David H. Petraeus, former director of the C.I.A., who is a Republican. In February, he said that Mrs. Clinton would be \u201ca tremendous president.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s two-day swing across Appalachia this week served as the beginning of the campaign\u2019s full-court press to convince persuadable white voters that she would run a more inclusive campaign than Mr. Trump \u2014 and to signal that she would cede no demographic group to him. \u201cI invite a lot of Republicans and independents who I\u2019ve been seeing on the campaign trail, who\u2019ve been reaching out to me, I invite them to join with Democrats,\u201d Mrs. Clinton  told CNN on Wednesday . \u201cLet\u2019s get off the red or the blue team. Let\u2019s get on the American team.\u201d In the Democratic primary, Mrs. Clinton has struggled with non-college-educated white voters and self-identified independents, often losing those groups by wide margins to Mr. Sanders. But faced with the choice between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, 51 percent of independents and 59 percent of moderates favor the former secretary of state, compared with 41 percent and 39 percent for Mr. Trump, according to  the most recent CNN\/ORC poll . \u201cIf the primary happened to be over already, we feel the coalition we\u2019ve built has the makings of a winning coalition as it is in a general election,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019re not satisfied with that. We want to make inroads even with populations that aren\u2019t supporting her in great numbers.\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton, said while campaigning with her at a diner in Athens, Ohio, on Tuesday that the suburban women in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati could ultimately decide the November election. \u201cI think educated suburban white women, to be sure, are going to be turned off en masse and there will be more of that,\u201d he said, referring to their opinion of Mr. Trump. On Friday, President Obama helped in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s effort. \u201cRepublican women, voters, are going to have to decide, \u2018Is that the guy I feel comfortable with representing me, and what I care about?\u2019\u201d  he said of Mr. Trump at a news conference . But if Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cBreaking Down Barriers Tour\u201d in Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia this week provided a road map for her campaign\u2019s strategy in the weeks ahead, the antagonistic reception she received also highlighted her own vulnerabilities and tendency to divide people \u2014 weaknesses Mr. Trump plans to exploit. At Mrs. Clinton\u2019s event in Athens, a protester, Peter Schmidt, 34 and a miller, held a handmade sign that read \u201cI\u2019d Rather Be Home Reading Your Goldman Sachs Transcripts,\u201d a reference to the paid speeches she delivered to the Wall Street bank. Mr. Schmidt said her tour of Appalachia felt like pandering. \u201cI don\u2019t trust her,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m holding this sign.\u201d Mr. Trump, who has proved adept in connecting with white working-class men, also plans to hit Mrs. Clinton on her previous support for global trade deals that many Americans blame for jobs moving overseas. He has giddily seized on a  comment she made to CNN in March  that \u201cwe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d The  backlash over that remark  \u2014 made in the context of replacing coal with clean energy jobs \u2014 turned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign events into an Appalachian apology tour, as she was repeatedly, and pointedly, forced to explain what she called a \u201cmisstatement.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t take it back,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told one out-of-work coal industry worker, Bo Copley, 39, a father of three and a registered Republican, when he emotionally confronted her about the comment. \u201cWhat I want you to know is I\u2019m going to do everything I can to help no matter what happens politically,\u201d she added. \u201cThat is just how I am made.\u201d The Clinton campaign is also moving to exploit the public criticism of Mr. Trump by prominent Republicans. On Wednesday, the campaign released an online ad that quotes Mr. Trump\u2019s former primary opponents describing him as a \u201cknow-nothing candidate,\u201d \u201ca narcissist\u201d and \u201cthe most vulgar person ever to aspire to the presidency,\u201d among other epithets. Mrs. Clinton has portrayed Mr. Trump as a \u201cloose cannon\u201d on foreign policy and often points to her husband\u2019s record as evidence that she would help blue-collar voters. \u201cThe brilliance of Bill Clinton gives her a particular edge,\u201d said Gaston Caperton, a Democratic former governor of West Virginia who supports Mrs. Clinton. Even with Mr. Clinton in its corner, the Clinton campaign does not expect to win voters like Mr. Copley, who said he is undecided but who generally fits Mr. Trump\u2019s core demographic of supporters. But Mrs. Clinton hopes to make inroads with women like Mr. Copley\u2019s wife, Lauren \u2014 voters whom Clinton aides call \u201cmegachurch moms\u201d and describe as religious, Republican-leaning women who reject Mr. Trump. Christine Matthews, a researcher who advises Republicans on how to win female voters, said that portraying Mr. Trump as dangerous on foreign policy could help Mrs. Clinton draw some Republican women whose most important issues are national security and terrorism. \u201cCan she drive moms who have kids who think, \u2018Oh my gosh, this is too scary a prospect and our country won\u2019t be safe if he\u2019s elected president?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Matthews said. \u201cYou can imagine that attack ad in your head.\u201d Democrats acknowledge that the prospect of terrifying skeptical voters into supporting their candidate would not be the most inspirational campaign message. It is a far bleaker appeal than Ronald Reagan\u2019s message of American exceptionalism and Mr. Clinton\u2019s promise to restore \u201cthe forgotten middle class,\u201d both of which inspired white working-class voters to cross party lines. But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pitch to Republicans reflects the grim political realities of 2016: More than half of the registered voters who said they would vote for Mrs. Clinton planned to do so in opposition to Mr. Trump, rather than in support of her candidacy, according to the CNN\/ORC poll. \u201cHer bumper sticker for Republicans should be \u2018Unified Against Trump\u2019 or \u2018Vote for the enemy. It\u2019s important,\u2019 \u201d said Ben Howe, a Republican and a contributing editor at the conservative online publication Red State, who posted the Clinton campaign\u2019s #ImWithHer slogan on Twitter after Mr. Trump\u2019s decisive victory in Indiana. Or, as Jan Franck, 65, a retiree in Charleston, W.Va., put it after hearing Mrs. Clinton speak on Tuesday: \u201cShe could be a sock puppet running against Donald Trump, and I\u2019d vote for her.\u201d","articles_date":"6 5 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/05\/07\/us\/politics\/hillary-clinton-republican-party.html","articles_title":"Hillary Clinton Targets Republicans Turned Off by Donald Trump","candidate_fk":2,"first_name":"Bo","id":127,"issue":8,"last_name":"Copley","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"New York (CNN) \"I'm sorry.\" With those simple words, Hillary Clinton, who thought she would wake up Wednesday as the first woman president-elect but crashed to a stunning election defeat to Donald Trump, ended her White House quest and likely her political career. The Democratic nominee unequivocally conceded the presidential race, and said that the Constitution requires a peaceful transfer of power. \"Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans,\" Clinton said. \"Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead,\" said Clinton, who was composed and dignified even as she admitted how painful her defeat was in her first public comments on the result of the election. \"This is not the outcome that we wanted and we worked so hard for, and I am sorry that we did not win this election,\" Clinton told supporters and campaign workers in New York. Clinton also addressed the historic achievement for which she twice strived in losing presidential campaigns. \"I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.\" \"And to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and to achieve your own dreams.\" Clinton's speech was devoid of bitterness and seemed at times to be an attempt to inspire her supporters about the virtues of public service and of fighting for what they believe. But she also put Trump on notice that the core American values which many Democrats believe Trump abhors, citing his proposals for a ban on Muslim immigration and rhetorical assaults on female journalists during his campaign, would not be forgotten. \"Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things: the rule of law, the principle that we are equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them.\" Tears flowed Much of the seating at Clinton's remarks was for staff and aides and the campaign was treating it as a farewell to the people who have spent the better part of two years working on her behalf, an aide said. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine also was on hand. The Virginia senator was not with Clinton Tuesday night. \"I'm proud of Hillary, because she loves this country,\" said Kaine, who had tears in his eyes, as he delivered introductory remarks. Aides throughout the ballroom were sobbing during Clinton's remarks. Quiet moments in the speech were filled with tears, sniffles and some sobs. Clinton's top aides, seated in the front row, were almost all crying. Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, was wiping away tears. Nick Merrill, Clinton's traveling press secretary, was weeping. The most somber moment in Clinton's speech was when she specifically noted her impact to women and girls. \"To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,\" Clinton said, her voice breaking with emotion. There were audible cries -- and some sobs -- throughout the room. Bill Clinton, while working the ropeline, wiped away tears. Huma Abedin cried during the speech but kept a stoic face during much of the ropeline. Clinton worked the ropeline after the event, moving from tearful conversation to tearful conversation. She first spoke with Anastasia Somoza, the 32-year old woman diagnosed with cerebral palsy and spastic quadriplegia who interned for Clinton's Senate office.  Bending down to hug Somoza, Clinton told her, \"You were so wonderful in every way. I love you.\" \"Thank you for all your work,\" Clinton told Somoza's mother. She hugged Joel Bennenson and John Anzalone, two of her pollsters, who acknowledged to other aides last night that they didn't see the Trump wave coming. She hugged Jim Margolis and Mandy Grunwald, who created many of the campaign's television ads. Clinton left somewhat unceremoniously, departing through a blue curtain to the left of the room and later to her motorcade. End of a campaign Her speech marked a bitter conclusion to a campaign that will be remembered for failing to fully energize Democratic voters and for squandering the party's traditional heartlands in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It also marked what could be the final act on the national stage of the Clinton double act, the political partnership between Bill Clinton and the former first lady and secretary of state that had seemed poised for a remarkable comeback, 16 years after they left the White House. Campaign staffers had spoken throughout Clinton's presidential bid of the extreme pressure many of them felt in facing Trump, whom Clinton argued was temperamentally and intellectually unfit for the presidency and to be in charge of the US nuclear arsenal. Now she is under pressure to call on a nation, split almost exactly down the middle, to unite behind the next president. Jason Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, lauded her speech. \"Very classy speech from @HillaryClinton. Important step in bringing our country together,\" he tweeted. It was not the first time Clinton has tasted the pain of ending a defeated presidential campaign. In 2008, she folded her primary bid against Barack Obama in Washington and bemoaned her failure to break the \"highest and hardest glass ceiling\" by becoming the first female president. That was to be her fate again in 2016, though the personal recriminations are likely to be even more intense this time given that Trump is seen by many Democrats as antithetical to American values. Clinton called Trump in the early hours of Wednesday to concede defeat after he shattered her Democratic firewall in the Midwest and swept to victory after the most vitriolic general election in generations. But she did not appear at her election night party in New York. At the time, her campaign chairman John Podesta explained that the campaign wanted to ensure that every vote in still undeclared states was counted -- though her position already seemed hopeless. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Wednesday that she was with Trump when Abedin, called to say her boss wanted to talk to the president-elect. \"I handed him the phone and they had a maybe one-minute conversation, very gracious, very warm. I heard Mr. Trump's side of it,\" Conway told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day. \"He commended her for being smart and tough and running a very hard-fought campaign. And I am told Secretary Clinton congratulated Donald Trump on his victory, and conceded to him,\" Conway said.","articles_date":"10 11 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/11\/09\/politics\/clinton-to-offer-remarks-in-new-york-city\/index.html","articles_title":"Hillary Clinton delivers painful concession speech","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":128,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.   (APPLAUSE)   Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.   (APPLAUSE)   Very rowdy group. Thank you, my friends. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so very much for being here and I love you all, too.   Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I'm sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.   But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together, this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.   (APPLAUSE)   I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person or even one election, it was about the country we love and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted.   We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.   Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things; the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them.   (APPLAUSE)   Now -- and let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years but all the time. So let's do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear; making our economy work for everyone not just those at the top, protecting our country and protecting our planet and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams.   CLINTON: We've spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American dream is big enough for everyone -- for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. For everyone.   (APPLAUSE)   So now, our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will.   I am so grateful to stand with all of you. I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey.   (APPLAUSE)   It has been a joy getting to know them better, and it gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy representing Virginia in the Senate.   (APPLAUSE)   To Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude.   (APPLAUSE)   We -- we thank you for your graceful, determined leadership that has meant so much to so many Americans and people across the world.   And to Bill and Chelsea, Mark, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express. You crisscrossed this country on our behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most -- even four-month-old Aidan who traveled with his mom.   I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country.   (APPLAUSE)   You poured your hearts into this campaign. For some of you who are veterans, it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns. Some of you, it was your first campaign. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted.   (APPLAUSE)   And to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook, even in secret, private Facebook sites...   (LAUGHTER)   (APPLAUSE)   ... I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward.   (APPLAUSE)   To everyone who sent in contributions as small at $5 and kept us going, thank you. Thank you from all of us.   And to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this. I have, as Tim said, spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I've had successes and I've had setbacks. Sometimes, really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too.   This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it.   (APPLAUSE)   CLINTON: It is -- it is worth it.   (APPLAUSE)   And so we need -- we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.   And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.   (APPLAUSE)   Now, I -- I know -- I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.   (APPLAUSE)   And -- and to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.   Finally...   (APPLAUSE)   Finally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me. I count my blessings every single day that I am an American. And I still believe as deeply as I ever have that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us.   (APPLAUSE)   Because, you know -- you know, I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that. You know, scripture tells us, \"Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap if we do not lose heart.\"   So my friends, let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come. And there is more work to do.   I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election.   May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.

Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.\" A statement from Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama on Tuesday evening similarly expressed disgust at Weinstein's reported actions and praised those who came forward. \"Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein,\" the statement said. \"Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status. We should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories. And we all need to build a culture -- including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect -- so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.\" Both statements made no mention of Weinstein's sizable donations to the Clinton and Obama war chests.  Shortly after the Obamas' announcement, Democratic leadership disavowed Weinstein as well. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from Weinstein's home state of New York, said on Twitter Tuesday evening he was sending donations from Weinstein to charities based in the state. \"What Mr. Weinstein did was awful. Sending his donations to NY orgs doing crucial work for survivors & fams, @SafeHorizon @sffny & @cvtcnyc,\" Schumer tweeted. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement calling on accountability for \"every man who disrespects and attacks women.\" \"The news of Harvey Weinstein's countless assaults on women and the clear efforts to intimidate his victims into silence are shocking,\" Pelosi's statement read. \"His despicable actions violate every standard of acceptable behavior.\" Weinstein is a longtime associate of the Clintons and a major Democratic Party donor who bundled funds for the party's political campaigns, including supporting both of Clinton's presidential bids. Weinstein was also a bundler -- someone who gathers donations from others into large sums -- for the Obama-Biden 2012 effort. The allegations against Weinstein have renewed a debate about sexual harassment in the workplace and drawn attention to Clinton, the Democrats' 2016 standard-bearer who made the treatment of women a key plank of her presidential campaign. Representatives for the former secretary of state and former President Bill Clinton had  previously not responded  to requests for comment about Weinstein, whose ties to the Clintons go back years, from the Clinton presidency to the former first lady's successful campaign for Senate. Clinton spoke in California Monday night as part of her book tour and did not address the allegations, nor was she asked about them during the 90-minute event. The office of former Vice President Joe Biden declined to comment.  Democrats disavow Many Democratic office-holders quickly repudiated Weinstein, with some going so far as to send donations given by Weinstein to charity.  Clinton's former running mate, Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine,  said on CNN  Tuesday morning that people should condemn Weinstein and said he anticipated Clinton would say something eventually.  Kaine noted Clinton has spoken out about sexual harassment often. During the campaign, Clinton spoke out about the issue and went after President Donald Trump over the allegations of sexual assault against him. Trump pushed back by touting similar allegations against her husband, former President Bill Clinton.  Early in the campaign, the former secretary of state  was asked  about some of those accusations and her own assertions that victims who allege assault should be believed. In the context of allegations against her husband, Clinton said, \"I would say that everyone should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.\" Clinton's condemnation Tuesday came after years of links between the Clintons, Weinstein and the Democratic Party. In 2015, the Clintons rented a home next to Weinstein in the Hamptons, and Weinstein served as a connector between Hollywood stars and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Weinstein raised about $1.5 million from 1990-2016, according to  data  from the campaign finance-tracking Center for Responsive Politics, and was involved in fundraisers for Clinton's effort, some of which she headlined.  Prior to Tuesday's announcement, longtime Hillary Clinton aides were confused by the former secretary of state's silence on the issue, questioning -- in private -- why she had not weighed in at all. The Obamas' ties with Weinstein were significant as well. Besides supporting Obama's 2012 presidential bid as a bundler and maintaining his role in the Democratic Party, Weinstein appeared at the White House several times for formal and informal events, and the Obamas' eldest daughter, Malia, interned at the Weinstein Company. At a White House event for student films in 2013, first lady Michelle Obama  credited  Weinstein for making the event happen and praised him as a wonderful person and a good friend, and Weinstein  was one  of many guests at a star-studded White House birthday party for Obama in 2016.  Like Clinton, the Obamas have repeatedly addressed and condemned sexual harassment and assault. Michelle Obama delivered a  scathing speech  last October, attacking Trump for having \"bragged about sexually assaulting women,\" in reference to the infamous Access Hollywood tape. Bombshell allegations A bombshell report in  The New York Times  detailed decades of sexual harassment by Weinstein, and just three days after its publication, Weinstein was fired by the company he founded.  On Tuesday, The New Yorker published a major story in which several women alleged sexual assault by Weinstein. Through his representative, Sallie Hofmeister, Weinstein  denied  \"any allegations of non-consensual sex.\" The reports have put Democrats under pressure to disavow Weinstein and return or donate contributions from him to charity. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, for example, said in a CNN interview on Sunday that Democrats should give any money they received from Weinstein back.

Beto O'Rourke knows most people are already writing off his long-shot bid to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, but he argues his race could be the key to flipping the Senate in 2018. \"I'd like nothing more for the establishment to count us out,\" O'Rourke told CNN in a phone interview from El Paso. The 44-year-old third-term House Democrat isn't hiring pollsters or campaign consultants and is sticking with a pledge he made during his first run for the House to refuse any corporate money or donations from political action committees. He pointed to his party's dismal record in the last 30 years trying to win a Senate seat in Texas, saying Democrats spent close to a billion dollars on \"consultants, polls, wizards and experts, and we really came up short.\" O'Rourke insisted that his retail strategy to travel the state is \"not complicated\" and made it clear he doesn't think much of targeted data-driven campaigns, saying, \"I'm going back to the basics.\" He said he could try the same playbook that other Democratic statewide candidates like former state Sen. Wendy Davis tried, or \"I can run an honest campaign about Texas, driven by Texas.\" Cruz didn't respond directly to O'Rourke's argument that the senator has been too focused on national politics, but said in a written statement to CNN that he \"will continue to work every day to earn and keep the trust of Texans across our great state. I'm confident that Texans want a senator who will lead the fight for freedom -- defending the Constitution, getting government off our backs, and allowing small businesses to create jobs and opportunity.\"  The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee was more direct about O'Rourke, saying he's out of step with the state. \"Beto O'Rourke would be a shoo-in for the United States Senate if he was running in Massachusetts or California -- his voting record is perfect for those states,\" committee spokeswoman Katie Martin told CNN in a written statement.  O'Rourke, who once traveled the country in a punk rock band, now represents the far-western corner of the state along the southwest border. He officially announced his campaign in his hometown of El Paso on Friday, saying, the state needs \"a senator who is not using this position of responsibility and power to serve his own interests, to run for president, to shut down the government.\"  Cruz was among those Republicans arguing that a must-pass spending bill in 2013 strip funding for Obamacare, and the standoff with the White House over the issue triggered a 16-day shutdown when federal agencies didn't have funding. When told that the other Texas Republican senator, John Cornyn, told Politico earlier this week that his campaign amounted to a \"suicide mission,\" O'Rourke seemed unfazed by the description, saying he has \"a tremendous amount of respect\" for Cornyn and they've worked on some issues together. O'Rourke said on a personal level Cruz is a \"nice guy,\" although he doesn't know him well. He noted that the GOP senator doesn't have an office in his district near the border, and said he approached Cruz during the 2013 fight over federal funding that resulted in a shutdown to appeal to him to back down because border agents and other federal employees were affected by the shutdown.   Before O'Rourke can train his focus on Cruz, however, he might need to clear a primary fight.  Rep. Joaquin Castro, whom O'Rourke phoned to tell him he was announcing his bid, is also considering the Senate race. O'Rourke said his colleague would make \"a great candidate, and I'm a fan of his, a friend of his,\" but when asked how he could prevail over him in a potential matchup, O'Rourke replied: \"I don't know.\" The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee so far isn't weighing in, instead deciding to focus on protecting incumbent senators in states Trump won in 2016, such as North Dakota, Missouri, and Indiana. The party faces tough odds of retaking the chamber; although the GOP holds a narrow, 52-48 majority, Democrats will have to defend 25 of the 33 contests in the 2018 midterms, including the two independents who caucus with the party, Maine's Angus King and Vermont's Bernie Sanders. But aides at the Senate Democrats' campaign arm tell CNN they are monitoring the Texas race. Both O'Rourke and Castro speak highly of each other, but cut different profiles in the House Democratic caucus. O'Rourke noted he voted against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and said he is \"fiercely independent,\" while Castro helps the leadership team corral votes and has been given a coveted seat on the House intelligence committee. Castro told CNN earlier this week that O'Rourke's move doesn't change his plans to continue looking at the race, and he's sticking with a timeline to make his decision sometime in April. Meanwhile, the dynamic that Democrats want to highlight is Cruz's own split with the President during the contentious GOP presidential primary. \"Here are some words we almost never say: Donald Trump was right -- about 'Lyin Ted,'\" David Bergstein, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told CNN. \"Texans know Ted Cruz is a self-serving politician, and this campaign will spotlight the many ways in which he's only ever looking out for himself,\"  In El Paso on Friday, O'Rourke said that even those he meets across the state who voted for Trump say they want someone in the Congress who will be willing to break through partisan sniping and get things done. But O'Rourke acknowledged that people are saying the same things now that they said about his first run for his congressional seat. \"I know a lot of people feel this is impossible,\" he said, but he dubbed El Paso, where he began a tour around the state, \"an underdog city.\"  CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this story","articles_date":"31 3 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/03\/31\/politics\/beto-cruz-senate-flip\/index.html","articles_title":"House Democrat calls bid to unseat Cruz key to flipping Senate","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":131,"issue":8,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) High school students who survived a mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, earlier this month, met with high-profile congressional leaders this week, including House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday. Ryan expressed a willingness for \"moving quickly\" on proposals to address gun violence after Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students urged the Wisconsin Republican for action, according to Florida Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch, who represents Parkland, Florida and who attended the meeting.  \"They don't want to simply have conversation,\" Deutch told reporters. \"They want action taken to try and prevent what happened at their school from happening anyplace else.\" Seventeen people died  in the February 14 shooting, allegedly perpetrated by 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, who police say used a  legally purchased AR-15 style rifle  for the massacre.  Asked if the speaker was open to the things they wanted, Deutch said the students have been clear in pushing specifically for a ban on assault-style weapons, banning high-capacity magazines and universal background checks, but that Ryan made it clear some of those things don't have broad support. All three of those proposals appear to have significant opposition in both chambers in Congress.  \"They had a good discussion about the Constitution, about constitutional rights,\" Deutch said. \"The students are very well-versed on the Second Amendment.\" He said the students pressed for a debate on the floor and a vote and the speaker was open to moving something. \"These students understand that the reason they came up here is to make sure that this debate doesn't stop, that they're not going to let it stop,\" Deutch said.  Earlier Tuesday during a news conference, Ryan signaled he isn't supportive of the proposals to impose new restrictions on gun purchases, telling reporters \"we shouldn't be banning guns for law-abiding citizens.\" \"Of course we want to listen to these kids, but we also want to make sure that we protect people's due process rights and legal constitutional rights while making sure that people who should not get guns don't get them,\" Ryan said. \"This kid was clearly one of those people.\" The students who survived that mass shooting have been a powerful political force, and met with other congressional leaders while in Washington,  including with House Republican Whip Steve Scalise , himself a survivor of gun violence after  he was shot last summer at a congressional baseball practice . Some students also met with the House Democratic Caucus earlier Tuesday. During a CNN town hall last week that featured survivors and some slain victims' families, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said he was reconsidering his position on high-capacity gun magazines and said he  supported raising the age to buy semi-automatic rifles  from 18 to 21.

The House Appropriations Committee approved by voice vote an amendment from Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee of California that would repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force eight months after the appropriations bill was signed into law. The amendment is intended is to force Congress to debate and pass a new war authorization for the war against ISIS and al Qaeda. Critics like Lee argue the 2001 war authorization is overly broad and gives the president \"the authority to wage war in perpetuity.\" This is believed to be the first time a congressional panel has voted to repeal the 2001 AUMF, setting the stage for a rare House floor debate and potential vote on an issue that lawmakers in both parties have been reluctant to take up, still wary of the consequences for Hillary Clinton and others after the 2002 Iraq War vote. The measure leaves open the question of what authorization would replace the 2001 AUMF, setting up the prospect of adding a major debate about the US role in the fight against ISIS to what's already a packed congressional agenda with health care, tax reform, spending cuts and more. However, the provision is a long way from being signed into law, as the defense appropriations bill will have to be eventually reconciled in the Senate, giving congressional leaders the ability to strip the AUMF language from a final spending bill. \"Today was just another step in the process, but it was historic, we got consensus in the appropriations committee,\" said Lee, who was the only member of Congress to vote against the 2001 AUMF. The 2001 AUMF was passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The call to pass a new war authorization intensified in 2014 when the US began fighting against ISIS in Iraq, but congressional leaders have resisted efforts to put AUMF bills on the floor. The amendment quickly provoked opposition, which could foreshadow a floor fight next month when the defense bill is expected to go to the floor. \"I am shocked and deeply troubled by the decision of the House Appropriations Committee to adopt an amendment that rescinds the authority granted by Congress to allow the President to execute the war against terrorism,\" said Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger. In the appropriations markup Thursday, Lee's amendment picked up steam from Republicans during debate, including Reps. Tom Cole of Oklahoma and Chris Stewart of Utah, an Air Force veteran. \"They have the courage to go out and fight these wars, and they notice we don't have the courage to debate this and give them the authority to go out and do this,\" said Stewart, an Air Force veteran. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Maryland Democrat, said he had planned to vote against Lee's amendment but changed his mind during the debate. The amendment passed by voice vote, eliciting cheers from Democrats. In the Senate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said the House vote could help spur additional momentum for Congress to take up a new war authorization. Kaine's bill with Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake could be taken up in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next month, he said. \"It hopefully will add some additional energy for the need to try to come up with a better, more current version,\" Kaine said.","articles_date":"29 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/29\/politics\/house-panel-repeal-war-authorization-isis-al-qaeda\/index.html","articles_title":"House panel votes to repeal war authorization for fight against ISIS and al Qaeda","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":133,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington  (CNN) A total of 10 Senate Democrats are up for re-election next year in states won by President Donald Trump.  Half of those senators are considered especially vulnerable because they represent states viewed as reliably red or states that have grown more Republican in recent years.  Those include Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana.   The other half hail from swing states that Trump won by a smaller margin and are less predictable.  Political observers will keep a close eye on this first group of senators and their actions on Capitol Hill. Will they support the President's agenda? Or will they side with Democrats in big votes? Will they act as deal-makers between the two parties? In the first 100 days of the Trump administration, several have made White House visits to sit down in a group setting with the President or attend bill signings.  Three of those Democrats \u2014 Manchin, Heitkamp and Donnelly -- went against their own party's filibuster of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and ultimately joined Republicans in the final confirmation vote.  This group of Democrats also had the fewest \"no\" votes on other major Trump nominees.   Meanwhile others, like McCaskill and Tester, refused to advance Gorsuch's nomination and voted against his final confirmation.  As for legislation, a few of the senators have crossed party lines to vote with Republicans this year, including on a bill that would roll back Obama-era regulations to  prevent coal mine waste  from entering waterways  to keep guns out of the hands of certain people with mental health issues.   One thing they all share is ramped-up pressure from outside groups on the right and the left.  Republican groups targeted them in the Gorsuch fight, releasing ads in their Trump-won states urging them to advance Gorsuch's nomination.  And while many of them have tried to position themselves as centrist or moderate Democrats,  Republicans have begun working to link them to liberal Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren.   They've also faced opposition from activists on the far left who have threatened primary challenges, though no serious challengers have stepped forward yet.   Here's a look at what the five senators have done so far this year:  Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia  Manchin has long been pushing his brand as a centrist Democrat willing to work across the aisle. That came into full focus this year after Trump won West Virginia overwhelmingly (by 42 points) in the November election.   The senator met with Trump in December to discuss a potential spot as energy secretary, but soon after the meeting Manchin said he planned to stay in the Senate.  Since then, Manchin has visited the White House multiple times and told CNN last week he has a \"good relationship\" with Trump.  \"I have access, I can speak to him,\" he said. \"I don't think he looks at me from the standpoint, 'Well, you're the opposition party and you're the opposition.'\"  Manchin has voted against four of Trump's Cabinet or major administration nominees -- casting the fewest \"no\" votes among Democrats -- and was the only one in his party to vote in favor of confirming Jeff Sessions for attorney general.   Manchin also worked behind the scenes with a bipartisan group of senators to urge both parties to find a deal to  avert the \"nuclear option\" in the battle over Gorsuch.  The talks were unsuccessful, but Manchin was vocal in his disappointment with both sides. He was one of three Democrats who ultimately voted to confirm Gorsuch.  In an unusual move, the senator has also been getting to know conservative media outlets, including Breitbart.  Manchin, who's in his first full term as a senator, faces a tough re-election battle in West Virginia next year, where Republicans feel confident they can pick up a Senate seat, given the state's support for Trump last year. Unlike other Democrats, who've benefited from grassroots enthusiasm, Manchin only raised about $550,000 in the first quarter.  Still, a Democrat, Jim Justice, was elected governor of West Virginia on the same ballot as Trump, showing the state's not-so-predictable voting behavior.  Rep. Evan Jenkins is considering a run for the Republican nomination to challenge Manchin, as is state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.  But Manchin, who's also served as governor of West Virginia, is a well-known figure in the state, and he's relying on his brand as a bipartisan broker to carry him to a second term.  Heidi Heitkamp, D -- North Dakota  Heitkamp was first elected in 2012 and raked in $1.6 million this quarter, finishing out the first three months of the year with $2 million in cash on hand. Like Manchin, she also comes from a state where Trump crushed Hillary Clinton last year, by 36 points.  Heitkamp was another Democrat who voted to confirm Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and she voted against five of Trump's nominees.  She also met with Trump during the transition about a potential Cabinet post and went to the White House with other senators for a lunch in February and separately for two bill signings.  Rep. Kevin Cramer, North Dakota's at-large representative, is thinking about challenging Heitkamp next year. But  CNN's Manu Raju reported earlier this month that Senate GOP officials have grown concerned  that Cramer's penchant for controversial remarks could damage the party's chances.  Heitkamp is heavily involved in tribal issues and introduced a bill this year to help Native American children who have experienced trauma. She's also paired up with Republican senators like Dean Heller of Nevada, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and John Boozman of Arkansas on other bills.  Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana  Donnelly also was first elected to the Senate in 2012, following three terms as a congressman. Trump won the state of Indiana, where Vice President Mike Pence was recently the state's governor, by 19 points.  Donnelly was the third Democrat to back Gorsuch, joining Manchin and Heitkamp, and he voted against six of Trump's major nominees. (He did not cast a vote on the nomination of Scott Pruitt for EPA administrator.)  He was also part of the  bipartisan group of senators  that met with Trump at the White House in February about Gorsuch, along with Manchin, Heitkamp and Tester.  Donnelly raised $1.3 million in the first quarter for 2018 and has $2.5 million cash on hand.  Indiana Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita are among the Republicans who could challenge Donnelly.  Donnelly helped author two bills that were signed into law by Trump -- one that designated March 29 as National Vietnam War Veterans Day and one that designates the location of the National Desert Storm War Memorial. He also paired up with the junior senator from Indiana, Republican Todd Young, this year to introduce legislation supporting mental health services for police officers, and he authored a bill to end outsourcing.   Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri  McCaskill, facing pressure from both sides of the aisle, has also been trying to paint herself as a moderate. She's up for a third term next year.  Republicans consider it a potentially strong pick-up seat, but there are some signs of advantages for McCaskill. While Trump won the state of Missouri by 19 points, the incumbent Republican senator, Roy Blunt, won by a far smaller margin of only three points on the same ballot.  And McCaskill raised a whopping $2.8 million in the first quarter and has $3 million in the bank. At a town-hall style meeting this month in Missouri, McCaskill was asked if she thinks the state's large number of Trump voters will hurt her chances at re-election,  according to the New York Times.  \"I'll tell you one thing that drives me crazy: my colleagues in Washington that are from places like California and New York who wanted to look down their nose at Trump voters,\" McCaskill said. \"I think that's a huge mistake.\" At the same time, McCaskill, who has publicly acknowledged that she could face a primary challenger, has been critical of several of Trump's policies. While McCaskill expressed concern about the use of the nuclear option to confirm Gorsuch, she ultimately joined her party in the filibuster and opposed his confirmation.  She also voted against seven of Trump's nominees and did not vote on Tom Price's nomination for Health and Human Services secretary.  McCaskill has helped introduce multiple bills this session aimed at eliminating waste in government. She's the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.  Jon Tester, D-Montana Tester, who was first elected to the Senate in 2006, is up for a third term next year in Montana, which Trump won by 21 points. Still, in a sign of hope for Tester, the state's Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, also won statewide election on the same ballot last November.  Like McCaskill, Tester opposed confirmation of Gorsuch, saying he didn't feel like Gorsuch was strong enough on campaign finance issues. He also voted against eight of Trump's other major nominees.  Tester showed a strong first quarter, bringing in $2 million and ending with $3.16 million cash on hand.  Trump signed a bill into law that Tester, the ranking member on the Veterans Affairs Committee, introduced earlier this year to expand and reform the Veterans Choice Program, which allows some veterans to use provide health care providers located near their homes. The bill was cosponsored by three Republican senators: John McCain, Johnny Isakson and Jerry Moran. Montana state Republican Sen. Albert Olszewski announced last week that he plans to challenge Tester,  according to local reports.   Previously the state's at large congressman, Ryan Zinke, was considered the most likely Republican to challenge Tester, but he was tapped by Trump for secretary of the Interior Department.

Five people were shot Wednesday morning,  including Majority Whip Steve Scalise, shattering a sense of security on Capitol Hill. But members' response to the shooting came down to one goal: unity. In a Capitol building that is typically full of partisan rancor, the mood was somber and quiet Wednesday. Votes were canceled in the House of Representatives as members waited anxiously to get more news on Scalise's condition. The Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer's staff delivered pizza to Scalise's office in the late afternoon. The Democratic baseball team invited the Republican team to the Democratic Club Wednesday night for dinner. Throughout the day, those House Republicans who were targeted at baseball practice were greeted with warm embraces and back slaps from fellow members on both sides of the aisle.  Ohio Rep Brad Wenstrup, on his way to do a TV interview with CNN, gave a bear hug to Georgia Rep. Doug Collins in the hallway. Texas Republican Rep. Joe Barton, the manager of the Republicans' team, recalled in an emotional news conference that his son was \"at practice this morning, and he had 25 dads.\" Rep. Mike Doyle, the Democratic baseball manager, touched Barton's arm at the podium to console him. When the House convened briefly at noon, members filed in and took their seats. On most days, members wouldn't go to the floor unless they were speaking, but on Wednesday the chamber was full. Members walked over to those Republican lawmakers who witnessed the attack and checked in on them. Members on both sides of the chamber listened intently to the comments by both House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Many praised the message of unity, and the appreciation the entire congressional community feels for the Capitol Police. On the Senate side, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer skipped their usual partisan opening speeches, and instead admonished the horrific attack and thanked the Capitol Police officers who saved lives on the field. \"There are no D's and R's behind our names today,\" Rep. Joe Crowley, a Democrat from New York, said. Members were visibly shaken by the events of Wednesday morning. Many Democrats and Republicans refrained from politicizing the attack or casting it as a referendum on the Second Amendment. Instead, they said the incident caused them to reflect on how the country might heal and come together after a contentious election and first few months of the Trump administration. \"I'm hopeful today's events create an opportunity for all Americans to stop and think about the level of political discourse in this country,\" said Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina who had been on his way to bible study when he heard the news. Hudson said that he was touched by a post in an Indivisible Facebook group -- a group that aligns itself with Democrats -- that celebrated that he was safe. \"That really meant a lot to me,\" he said. In a closed-door, all-member House briefing Wednesday morning, Rep. Al Green, a Democrat from Texas  who has called for Trump's impeachment  on the House floor, rose to say \"an attack on one is an attack on all.\" For many members, the men's baseball and women's softball teams had become a rare opportunity to break away from partisan lines in recent months. \"What makes it even more awful is this is one of the things that's right with this town. This is a game where Republicans and Democrats come together and put fellowship and bipartisanship ahead of party politics,\" said Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy. \"I know Steve Scalise because of this baseball game. For eight years, I've been the catcher bantering with Steve Scalise when he comes up to bat a few times a game.\" \"I mean, I've only been in Congress for 10 years and I've had two of my friends shot,\" Murphy added. \"I don't think you're human if that doesn't shake you.\" Panic on the field The timeline of the morning's event had been recounted over and over again. Members told stories of their colleagues coming to their side.  Wenstrup, who is an Iraq war veteran and  medic, jumped into the dugout when he heard Rep. Trent Kelly, of Mississippi, another veteran, yell \"shooter\" Wednesday morning.  Wenstrup treated Scalise at the scene  and told CNN he was concerned about the majority whip. He had found an entry wound for the bullet, but couldn't find the exit wound, and was concerned about internal injuries. He said Scalise was conscious, answering questions, and asked for water. He said that he and his GOP colleagues had felt hopeless as the gunfire continued and they saw Scalise alone and hit out on the field. They were unable to get to him for several minutes. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann retold the story to reporters off the floor of how members huddled down in the dugout waiting for the gunshots to end. \"We were scared because when the gunfire didn't stop we thought, 'Oh my gosh he's gonna come in there and we're like sitting ducks,'\" Fleishmann said. \"It was chaotic and afterwards it was very sad because there were so many people injured.\"  How to move forward The congressional baseball game and the women's press vs. member softball game will go on at the behest of members who don't want to let Wednesday's shooting shatter their bridge to bipartisanship. But Wednesday, members were still grappling with how to move forward.  \"You become numb to this until something like this happens,\" said Rep. Lou Baretta, a Pennsylvania Republican. \"It's the reality check that this is the world we live in today. It's very easy targets.\" Lawmakers and their staffs said Wednesday's shooting once again exposed a reality that they are vulnerable targets anytime they leave the security of the Capitol. Many pondered security changes that could be in store, but most acknowledged it was not feasible to give all 535 lawmakers on Capitol Hill a security detail. \"People think members have security,\" Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said. \"We have wonderful security on the Hill, but anytime we're off, we don't. So it's very sobering, and I'm sure we'll have to grapple with it.\" Some were already contemplating what changes could be made, a subject Sen. Rand Paul -- who was on the field at Wednesday's shooting -- said he's been thinking about since the Charlie Hebdo attacks in France in 2015. \"I think we will make some proposals and changes,\" the Kentucky Republican told reporters. \"About a year ago I got interested in Charlie Hebdo, I've been promoting these changes around here, some changes to our entrances. I have been interested in it. With this latest attack, I think we're going to redouble our efforts to look at security.\" Sen. David Perdue suggested that perhaps police should be present for groups of lawmakers gathering outside the Capitol, but he argued it was important for Congress not to wall itself off from the public. \"I don't think you want to build a barrier between individuals and their constituents or individuals and the public,\" Perdue said. \"That's not America. So, it's one of the risks you take on.\"","articles_date":"14 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/14\/politics\/congress-baseball-shooting-mood-capitol-hill\/index.html","articles_title":"How Capitol Hill came together in the wake of a shooting","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":135,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The campaign ad appeared during the presidential contest of 2008. Rapid-fire images of belching smokestacks and melting ice sheets were followed by a soothing narrator who praised a candidate who had stood up to President George W. Bush and \u201csounded the alarm on global warming.\u201d It was not made for a Democrat,  but for Senator John McCain , who had just secured the Republican nomination. It is difficult to reconcile the Republican Party of 2008 with the party of 2017, whose leader, President Trump, has called global warming a hoax, reversed environmental policies that Mr. McCain advocated on his run for the White House, and this past week announced that he would  take the nation out of the Paris climate accord , which was to bind the globe in an effort to halt the planet\u2019s warming. The Republican Party\u2019s fast journey from debating how to combat human-caused climate change to arguing that it does not exist is a story of big political money, Democratic hubris in the Obama years and a partisan chasm that grew over nine years like a crack in the Antarctic shelf, favoring extreme positions and uncompromising rhetoric over cooperation and conciliation. \u201cMost Republicans still do not regard climate change as a hoax,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist who worked for Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cBut the entire climate change debate has now been caught up in the broader polarization of American politics.\u201d \u201cIn some ways,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s become yet another of the long list of litmus test issues that determine whether or not you\u2019re a good Republican.\u201d Since Mr. McCain ran for president on climate credentials that were stronger than his opponent Barack Obama\u2019s, the scientific evidence linking greenhouse gases from fossil fuels to the dangerous warming of the planet has grown stronger. Scientists have for the first time drawn concrete links between the planet\u2019s warming atmosphere and changes that affect Americans\u2019 daily lives and pocketbooks, from tidal flooding in Miami to prolonged water shortages in the Southwest to decreasing snow cover at ski resorts. That scientific consensus was enough to pull virtually all of the major nations along. Conservative-leaning governments in Britain, France, Germany and Japan all signed on to successive climate change agreements. Yet when Mr. Trump pulled the United States from the Paris accord, the Senate majority leader, the speaker of the House and every member of the elected Republican leadership were united in their praise. Those divisions did not happen by themselves. Republican lawmakers were moved along by a campaign carefully crafted by fossil fuel industry players, most notably Charles D. and David H. Koch, the Kansas-based billionaires who run a chain of refineries (which can process  600,000 barrels of crude oil per day ) as well as a subsidiary that owns or operates  4,000 miles of pipelines  that move crude oil. Government rules intended to slow climate change are \u201cmaking people\u2019s lives worse rather than better,\u201d Charles Koch explained in a rare  interview last year  with Fortune, arguing that despite the costs, these efforts would make \u201cvery little difference in the future on what the temperature or the weather will be.\u201d Republican leadership has also been dominated by lawmakers whose constituents were genuinely threatened by policies that would raise the cost of burning fossil fuels,  especially coal . Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, always sensitive to the coal fields in his state, rose through the ranks to become majority leader. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming also climbed into leadership, then the chairmanship of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, as a champion of his coal state. Mr. Trump has staffed his White House and cabinet with officials who have  denied, or at least questioned, the existence of global warming . And he has adopted the Koch language, almost to the word. On Thursday, as Mr. Trump announced the United States\u2019 withdrawal,  he at once claimed that the Paris accord would cost the nation millions of jobs and that it would do next to nothing for the climate . Beyond the White House, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Science Committee, held a  hearing this spring  aimed at debunking climate science, calling the global scientific consensus \u201cexaggerations, personal agendas and questionable predictions.\u201d A small core of Republican lawmakers \u2014 most of whom are from swing districts and are at risk of losing their seats next year \u2014 are taking modest steps like introducing a  nonbinding resolution in the House  in March urging Congress to accept the risks presented by climate change. But in Republican political circles, speaking out on the issue, let alone pushing climate policy, is politically dangerous. So for the most part, these moderate Republicans are biding their time, until it once again becomes safe for Republicans to talk more forcefully about climate change. The question is how long that will take. \u201cWith 40 percent of Florida\u2019s population at risk from sea-level rise, my state is on the front lines of climate change,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida. \u201cSouth Florida residents are already beginning to feel the effects of climate change in their daily lives.\u201d It was called the \u201cNo Climate Tax\u201d pledge, drafted by a new group called Americans for Prosperity that was funded by the Koch brothers. Its single sentence read: \u201cI will oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue.\u201d Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, was the  first member of Congress to sign it in July 2008 . The effort picked up steam the next year after the House of Representatives passed what is known as cap-and-trade legislation, a concept invented by conservative Reagan-era economists. The idea was to create a statutory limit, or cap, on the overall amount of a certain type of pollution that could be emitted. Businesses could then buy and sell permits to pollute, choosing whether to invest more in pollution permits, or in cleaner technology that would then save them money and allow them to sell their allotted permits. The administration of the first President George Bush successfully deployed the first national cap-and-trade system in 1990 to lower emissions of the pollutants that cause acid rain. Mr. McCain pushed a cap-and-trade proposal to fight climate change. \u201cI thought we could get it done,\u201d recalled Henry A. Waxman, a retired House Democrat who led the cap-and-trade push in 2009. \u201cWe just had two candidates from the Republican and Democratic parties who had run for president and agreed that climate change was a real threat.\u201d Conservative activists saw the legislative effort as an opportunity to transform the climate debate. With the help of a small army of oil-industry-funded academics like  Wei-Hock Soon of Harvard Smithsonian  and think tanks like the  Competitive Enterprise Institute , they had been working to discredit academics and government climate change scientists. The lawyer and conservative activist Chris Horner, whose legal clients have included  the coal industry ,  gathered documents  through the Freedom of Information Act to try to embarrass and further undermine the climate change research. Myron Ebell, a senior fellow with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, worked behind the scenes to make sure Republican offices in Congress knew about Mr. Horner\u2019s work \u2014 although at the time, many viewed Mr. Ebell skeptically, as an extremist pushing out-of-touch views. In 2009, hackers broke  into a climate research program at the University of East Anglia in England , then released the emails that conservatives said raised doubts about the validity of the research. In one email, a scientist talked of using a statistical \u201ctrick\u201d in a chart illustrating a recent sharp warming trend. The research was ultimately validated, but damage was done. As Congress moved toward actually passing climate change legislation, a fringe issue had become a part of the political mainstream. \u201cThat was the turning point,\u201d Mr. Horner said. The House  passed the cap-and-trade bill by seven votes , but it went nowhere in the Senate \u2014 Mr. Obama\u2019s first major legislative defeat. Unshackled by the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision and other related rulings, which ended corporate campaign finance restrictions, Koch Industries and Americans for Prosperity started an all-fronts campaign with television advertising, social media and cross-country events aimed at electing lawmakers who would ensure that the fossil fuel industry would not have to worry about new pollution regulations. Their first target: unseating Democratic lawmakers such as Representatives Rick Boucher and Tom Perriello of Virginia, who had voted for the House cap-and-trade bill, and replacing them with Republicans who were seen as more in step with struggling Appalachia, and who pledged never to push climate change measures. But Americans for Prosperity also wanted to send a message to Republicans. Until 2010, some Republicans ran ads in House and Senate races showing their support for green energy. \u201cAfter that, it disappeared from Republican ads,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. \u201cPart of that was the polling, and part of it was the visceral example of what happened to their colleagues who had done that.\u201d What happened was clear. Republicans who asserted support for climate change legislation or the seriousness of the climate threat saw their money dry up or, worse, a primary challenger arise. \u201cIt told Republicans that we were serious,\u201d Mr. Phillips said, \u201cthat we would spend some serious money against them.\u201d By the time Election Day 2010 arrived, 165 congressional members and candidates had signed Americans for Prosperity\u2019s \u201c No Climate Tax\u201d pledge . Most were  victorious . \u201cThe midterm election was a clear rejection of policies like the cap-and-trade energy taxes that threaten our still-fragile economy,\u201d said James Valvo, then Americans for Prosperity\u2019s government affairs director, in a statement issued the day after the November 2010 election.  Eighty-three of the 92 new members of Congress  had signed the pledge. Even for congressional veterans, that message was not missed. Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who once called climate change \u201ca serious problem\u201d and co-sponsored a bill to promote energy-efficient light bulbs, tacked right after the 2010 elections as he battled to be chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee against Joe Barton, a Texan who mocked human-caused climate change. Mr. Upton deleted references to climate change from his website. \u201cIf you look, the last year was the warmest year on record, the warmest decade on record. I accept that,\u201d he offered that fall. \u201cI do not say that it\u2019s man-made.\u201d Mr. Upton, who has received  more than $2 million  in campaign donations from oil and gas companies and electric utilities over the course of his career, won the chairmanship and has coasted comfortably to re-election since. Two years later, conservative \u201csuper PACs\u201d took aim at Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a senior Republican who publicly voiced climate concerns, backed the creation of a Midwestern cap-and-trade program and drove a Prius. After six Senate terms,  Mr. Lugar lost his primary  to a Tea Party challenger, Richard E. Mourdock. Although Mr. Lugar says other reasons contributed, he and his opponents say his public views on climate change played a crucial role. \u201cIn my own campaign, there were people who felt strongly enough about my views on climate change to use it to help defeat me, and other Republicans are very sensitive to that possibility,\u201d Mr. Lugar said in an interview. \u201cSo even if they privately believe we ought to do something about it, they\u2019re reticent, especially with the Republican president taking the views he is now taking.\u201d After winning re-election in 2012, Mr. Obama understood his second-term agenda would have to rely on executive authority, not legislation that would go nowhere in the Republican-majority Congress. And climate change was the great unfinished business of his first term. To finish it, he would deploy a rarely used provision in the Clean Air Act of 1970, which gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to issue regulations on carbon dioxide. \u201cIf Congress won\u2019t act soon to protect future generations, I will,\u201d he declared in his 2013  State of the Union address . The result was the Clean Power Plan, which would significantly cut planet-warming emissions by forcing the closing of hundreds of heavy-polluting coal-fired power plants. The end run around Congress had consequences of its own. To Republican (and some Democratic) critics, the Clean Power Plan exemplified everything they opposed about Mr. Obama: He seemed to them imperious, heavy-handed, pleasing to the elites on the East and West Coasts and in the capitals of Europe, but callous to the blue-collar workers of coal and oil country. \u201cIt fed into this notion of executive overreach,\u201d said Heather Zichal, who advised Mr. Obama on climate policy. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a good enough job on managing the narrative.\u201d Republicans who had supported the climate change agenda began to defect and have since stayed away. \u201cOn the issue of climate change, I think it\u2019s happening,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a CNN podcast interview last April. But, he said, \u201cThe president decided, at least in the last couple years if not more, to rule by edict.\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s political opponents saw the climate rules as a ripe opportunity. \u201cWhen the president went the regulatory route, it gave our side more confidence,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cIt hardened and broadened Republican opposition to this agenda.\u201d Starting in early 2014, the opponents of the rule \u2014 including powerful lawyers and lobbyists representing many of America\u2019s largest manufacturing and industrial interests \u2014 regularly gathered in a large conference room at the national headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, overlooking the White House. They drafted a long-game legal strategy to undermine Mr. Obama\u2019s climate regulations in a coordinated campaign that brought together 28 state attorneys general and major corporations to form an argument that they expected to eventually take to the Supreme Court. They presented it not as an environmental fight but an economic one, against a government that was trying to vastly and illegally expand its authority. \u201cThis is the most significant wholesale regulation of energy that the United States has ever seen, by any agency,\u201d Roger R. Martella Jr., a former E.P.A. lawyer who then represented energy companies, said at  a gathering of industry advocates , making an assertion that has not been tested. Republican attorneys general gathered at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia in August 2015 for their annual summer retreat, with some  special guests : four executives from Murray Energy, one of the nation\u2019s largest coal mining companies. Murray was struggling to avoid bankruptcy \u2014 a fate that had befallen  several other  coal mining companies already, given the slump in demand for their product and the rise of natural gas, solar and wind energy. The coal industry  came to discuss  a new part of the campaign to reverse the country\u2019s course on climate change. Litigation was going to be needed, the industry executives and the Republican attorneys general agreed, to block the Obama administration\u2019s climate agenda \u2014 at least until a new president could be elected. West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, led the session, \u201cThe Dangerous Consequences of the Clean Power Plan & Other E.P.A. Rules,\u201d which included, according to the agenda, Scott Pruitt, then the attorney general of Oklahoma; Ken Paxton, Texas\u2019 attorney general; and Geoffrey Barnes, a corporate lawyer for Murray, which had donated $250,000 to the Republican attorneys general political group. That same day, Mr. Morrissey would step outside the hotel  to announce  that he and other attorneys general would sue in federal court to try to stop the Clean Power Plan, which he called \u201cthe most far-reaching energy regulation in this nation\u2019s history, drawn up by radical bureaucrats.\u201d Mr. Pruitt  quickly beca me  a national point person for industry-backed groups and a magnet for millions of dollars of campaign contributions, as the fossil fuel lobby looked for a fresh face with conservative credentials and ties to the evangelical community. \u201cPruitt was instrumental \u2014 he and A.G. Morrisey,\u201d said Thomas Pyle,  a former lobbyist  for Koch Industries, an adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team and the president of a pro-fossil fuel Washington research organization, the Institute for Energy Research. \u201cThey led the charge and made it easier for other states to get involved. Some states were keeping their powder dry, but Pruitt was very out front and aggressive.\u201d After  the litigation was filed  \u2014 by Mr. Morrissey and Mr. Pruitt, along with other attorneys general who attended the Greenbrier meeting \u2014 Murray Energy sued in the federal court case as well, just as had been planned. In February 2016, the  Supreme Court indicated  that it would side with opponents of the rule, moving by a 5-4 vote to grant a request by the attorneys general and corporate players to block the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while the case worked its way through the federal courts. When Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, he did not appear to have a clear understanding of the nation\u2019s climate change policies. Nor, at the start of his campaign, did he appear to have any specific plan to prioritize a huge legal push to roll those policies back. Mr. Trump had, in 2012,  said on Twitter , \u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d But he had also, in 2009, joined dozens of other business leaders to sign  a full-page ad  in the The New York Times urging Mr. Obama to push a global climate change pact being negotiated in Copenhagen, and to \u201cstrengthen and pass United States legislation\u201d to tackle climate change. However, it did not go unnoticed that coal country was giving his presidential campaign a wildly enthusiastic embrace, as miners came out in full force for Mr. Trump, stoking his populist message. And the surest way for Mr. Trump to win cheers from coal crowds was to aim at an easy target: Mr. Obama\u2019s climate rules. Hillary Clinton did not help her cause when she  said last spring  that her climate policies would \u201cput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d In May 2016, Mr. Trump  addressed one of the largest rallies of his campaign : an estimated crowd of over 10,000 in Charleston, W.Va., where the front rows were crammed with mine workers. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about miners all over the country,\u201d he said, eliciting cheers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put miners back to work.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t used to have all these rules and regulations that make it impossible to compete,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take it all off the table.\u201d Then an official from the West Virginia Coal Association handed the candidate a miner\u2019s hat. As he put it on, giving the miners a double thumbs-up, \u201cThe place just went nuts, and he loved it,\u201d recalled  Barry Bennett , a former adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cAnd the miners started showing up at everything. They were a beaten lot, and they saw him as a savior. So he started using the \u2018save coal\u2019 portions of the speech again and again.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers embraced the miners as emblematic of the candidate\u2019s broader populist appeal. \u201cThe coal miners were the perfect case for what he was talking about,\u201d Mr. Bennett said, \u201cthe idea that for the government in Washington, it\u2019s all right for these people to suffer for the greater good \u2014 that federal power is more important than your little lives.\u201d Mr. Trump took on as an informal campaign adviser Robert E. Murray \u2014 chief executive of the same coal company that had been working closely for years with the Republican attorneys general to unwind the Obama environmental legacy. Mr. Murray, a brash and folksy populist who started working in coal mines as a teenager, is an unabashed skeptic of climate science. The coal magnate and Mr. Trump had a natural chemistry, and where Mr. Trump lacked the legal and policy background to unwind climate policy, Mr. Murray was happy to step in. \u201cI thank my lord, Jesus Christ, for the election of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Murray said soon after his new friend won the White House. Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Ebell, the Competitive Enterprise Institute fellow who had worked for years to undermine the legitimacy of established climate science, to head the transition team at E.P.A. Mr. Ebell immediately began pushing for an agenda of gutting the Obama climate regulations and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. When it came time to translate Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to coal country into policy, Mr. Murray and others helped choose the perfect candidate: Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general. Mr. Trump, who had never met Mr. Pruitt before his election, offered him the job of E.P.A. administrator \u2014 putting him in a position to dismantle the environmental rules that he had long  sought to fight in court . Meanwhile, Mr. Trump wanted to be seen delivering on the promises he had made to the miners. As controversies piled up in his young administration, he sought comfort in the approval of his base. In March, Mr. Trump signed  an executive order  directing Mr. Pruitt to begin unwinding the Clean Power Plan \u2014 and he did so at a large public ceremony at the E.P.A., flanked by coal miners and coal executives. Mr. Murray beamed in the audience. Meanwhile, a battle raged at the White House over whether to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, urged him to remain in, cautioning that withdrawing could be devastating to the United States\u2019 foreign policy credentials. Murray Energy \u2014 despite its enormous clout with Mr. Trump and his top environmental official \u2014 boasts a payroll with only 6,000 employees. The coal industry nationwide is  responsible for  about  160,000 jobs,  with just 65,000 directly in mining, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. By comparison,  General Electric  alone has 104,000 employees in the United States, and  Apple  has 80,000. Their chief executives openly pressed Mr. Trump to stick with Paris, as did dozens of other major corporations that have continued to support regulatory efforts to combat climate change. But these voices did not have clout in Washington, either in Congress or at the White House, when it comes to energy policy. Mr. Trump\u2019s senior adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, backed by Mr. Pruitt, told the president that pulling out of the deal would mean a promise kept to his base. \u201cIt is time to put Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania \u2014 along with many, many other locations within our great country \u2014 before Paris, France,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his  Rose Garden speech  on Thursday. \u201cIt is time to make America great again.\u201d The recognition that human activity is influencing the climate developed slowly, but a scientific consensus can be traced to  a conference in southern Austria  in October 1985. Among the 100 or so attendees who gathered in the city of Villach, nestled in the mountains along the Drava River, was  Bert Bolin , a Swedish meteorologist and a pioneer in using computers to model the climate. Dr. Bolin helped steer the conference to its conclusion: \u201cIt is now believed that in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature could occur which is greater than any in man\u2019s history,\u201d he wrote in the conference\u2019s 500-page report. While the politics of climate change in the United States has grown more divided since then, the scientific community has united: Global warming is having an impact, scientists say, with sea levels rising along with the extremity of weather events. Most of the debate is about the extent of those impacts \u2014 how high the seas may rise, or how intense and frequent heavy storms or heat waves may be. In recent years, many climate scientists have also dropped their reluctance to pin significant weather events on climate change. Studies have shown that certain events \u2014 a  2015 Australian heat wave ,  floods in France  last year and recent high temperatures in the Arctic \u2014 were  made more likely because of global warming . But in Congress, reluctance to embrace that science has had no political downsides, at least among Republicans. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet have an example of where someone has paid a political price being on that side of it,\u201d said Michael Steel, who served as press secretary for the former House speaker John A. Boehner, the Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and the current House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, during his 2012 run as Mitt Romney\u2019s vice-presidential choice. Instead, the messages of Mr. Pruitt still dominate. \u201cThis is an historic restoration of American economic independence \u2014 one that will benefit the working class, the working poor and working people of all stripes,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said on Thursday, stepping to the Rose Garden lectern after Mr. Trump. \u201cWe owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.\u201d American voters \u2014 even many Republicans \u2014 recognize that  climate change is starting to affect their lives . About 70 percent think global warming is happening, and about 53 percent think it is caused by human activities, according to  a recent study  by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. About 69 percent support limiting carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. But most public opinion polls find that voters rank the environment last or nearly last among the issues that they vote on. And views are divided based on party affiliation. In 2001, 46 percent of Democrats said they worried \u201ca great deal\u201d about climate change, compared with 29 percent of Republicans, according to a Gallup tracking poll on the issue. This year, concern among Democrats has reached 66 percent. Among Republicans, it has fallen, to 18 percent. Until people vote on the issue, Republicans will find it politically safer to question climate science and policy than to alienate moneyed groups like Americans for Prosperity. There will be exceptions. The  2014 National Climate Assessment , a report produced by 14 federal agencies, concluded that climate change is responsible for much of the flooding now plaguing many of the Miami area\u2019s coastal residents, soaking homes and disrupting businesses, and Representative Curbelo is talking about it. \u201cThis is a local issue for me,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said. \u201cEven conservatives in my district see the impact. It\u2019s flooding, and it\u2019s happening now.\u201d Mr. Curbelo helped create the House Climate Solutions Caucus,  20 Republicans and 20 Democrats  who say they are committed to tackling climate change. Mr. Curbelo is confident that as the impact of climate change spreads, so will the willingness of his Republican colleagues to join him. Outside of Congress, a small number of establishment conservatives, including a handful of leaders from the Reagan administration, have begun pushing Washington to act on climate change. Earlier this year, James A. Baker III, one of the Republican Party\u2019s more eminent senior figures, met with senior White House officials to urge them to consider incorporating a carbon tax as part of a broader tax overhaul package \u2014 a way to both pay for proposed cuts to corporate tax rates and help save the planet. A Reagan White House senior economist, Art Laffer; a former secretary of state, George P. Shultz; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., George W. Bush\u2019s final Treasury secretary, have also pushed the idea. \u201cThere are members from deep-red districts who have approached me about figuring out how to become part of this effort,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said. \u201cI know we have the truth on our side. So I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll win \u2014 eventually.\u201d","articles_date":"3 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/06\/03\/us\/politics\/republican-leaders-climate-change.html","articles_title":"How G.O.P.

The latest emails could relate most directly to federal campaign finance law barring the solicitation of any contribution or \"thing of value\" from foreign nationals. Legal analysts also raise the possibility of perjury, for example, if Trump Jr. or anyone else involved earlier denied any Russian meeting to federal investigators. Anyone who made a false statement to federal investigators about the meeting, including a material omission on government personnel paperwork, could be in serious jeopardy. It is not clear that he has made any statements under oath related to the Russian interference in the election. Some other critics of the administration, including Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who was Clinton's running mate, have suggested the President's son might have engaged in treason by dealing with a foreign adversary -- but that is a possibility that many legal analysts reject. Both Constitution and federal law covering treason provide the United States be actively at war with the foreign adversary for such a charge. The New York Times first reported on Saturday the meeting between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer. Trump's son Tuesday released a chain of emails about the meeting with someone the email said was a Kremlin-connected lawyer who supposedly had \"very high level and sensitive information\" that would \"incriminate\" Clinton. That email from  publicist Rob Goldstone  offered a meeting with \"a Russian government attorney\" with \"some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia.\" Trump Jr. responded: \"If it's what you say I love it.\" Federal campaign finance law makes it a crime to \"knowingly solicit, accept, or receive from a foreign national any contribution or donation ... or other thing of value.\" The crucial question of any prosecution would involve whether the information exchanged rises to a \"thing of value,\" said CNN legal analyst Stephen Vladeck. \"Whether the Trump campaign violated campaign finance laws simply by having the meeting is actually a bit complicated,\" said Vladeck, \"a University of Texas law professor, because it turns to some degree on the extent to which the opposition research is a 'thing of value,' and whether the Russians thereby gave 'substantial assistance' to the campaign, terms that are notoriously opaque in this context.\" He added that for federal investigators, the larger issue could be whether laws were broken in subsequent misstatements or refusals to acknowledge the existence of the meeting. Richard Hasen, a University of California, Irvine, law professor who specializes in election law, said Tuesday's disclosures could ramp up the legal consequences. He said the emails suggest the President's son knew he would be meeting with a foreign source for potentially valuable information. He cautioned, however, that such campaign violations can be difficult to prove. For someone to be prosecuted under the law, it would have to be shown that he went into the meeting asking for the information, not simply \"hoping\" for potential dirt, Hasen said. \"The email, if accurate,\" Hasen said, \"seems to show knowledge (of the Russian government connection) but we don't know if the email is accurate or there is more. There is also the legal issue as to whether this promise of dirt from the Russian government can be a 'thing of value' for purposes of the law.\" Hasen said earlier Federal Election Commission guidance would suggest such opposition research would be covered, but that he was not aware of any prosecutions that would be relevant to the new Trump controversy.  Sen. Kaine said Tuesday that the latest revelations about Trump Jr. meant that the investigation should move toward \"even potentially treason.\" Richard Painter, one of the top ethics lawyers during President George W. Bush's administration, has offered a similar assessment, including by tweeting on Sunday: \"This is treason. He must have known that the only way Russia would get such information was by spying.\" But other analysts say such a charge would require that the US and Russia actually be at war.  \"I think it's absurd to call it treason,\" sad CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, who has previously argued that Trump's alleged efforts to influence former FBI Director James Comey likely amounted to obstruction of justice. Carlton F.W. Larson, a constitutional law professor at the University of California at Davis who has extensively studied treason laws, has previously cast doubts on the treason angle. In February, he wrote that it was a \"myth\" that aiding Russia is treason. Part of the difficulty, he argued, is that treason laws specifically are designed to guard against aiding \"enemies\" of the United States. That's defined as countries with which the United States is at war, and the US is not currently at war with Russia.

Elizabeth Warren's first question at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. \"Gen. (David) Goldfein, would a significant reduction in funding to the State Department and other non-defense security agencies and programs make the Air Force job of defending America easier or harder?\" Warren asked the Air Force chief of staff in June. The Massachusetts Democrat and potential 2020 hopeful asked a version of the same question to Pentagon officials at 11 armed services hearings this year, getting the military brass to break repeatedly with the commander- in-chief's proposed deep cuts to the State Department. Warren, who was elected to the Senate in 2012, was appointed to the Senate Armed Services Committee this year in what  many viewed as an opportunity to bolster her national security bona fides  ahead of a possible 2020 presidential run. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker was picked for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this year in a similar vein. And freshman California Sen. Kamala Harris was given a seat on the intelligence committee, where the panel's must-see Russia hearings have already given a serious boost to her national profile. A CNN review of the three senators' performances on their respective national security committees shines a light into their foreign policy worldviews and how they are building a national security portfolio ahead of the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign. All three have used the committee hearings to hammer the Trump administration \u2014 on the budget, on foreign policy, and on Russia \u2014 but there are also some differences likely to emerge if they do take the plunge to run for president. Warren has been a studious member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, attending all but one subcommittee hearing out of the 40-plus committee hearings so far this year. In addition to focusing on Trump's positions on the military budget and climate change, Warren has gone to bat for her home-state defense interests. Booker has been less of a fixture on Foreign Relations, appearing to ask questions at just over a third of the panel's hearings, the second-worst record among the 22 senators on the panel, according to a CNN review of the transcripts. But he was given the ranking member slot on the Africa and Global Health Policy Subcommittee, where he's been able to push for hearings on specific issues. While the intelligence committee typically operates behind closed doors, the panel's investigation into Russia's election interference has vaulted it into the most high-profile congressional committee this year, and Harris' prosecutorial style was in the spotlight after she was interrupted twice by Chairman Richard of North Carolina Burr and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans. Warren: Massachusetts Institute of (Military) Technology Warren's move to the Armed Services Committee this year sparked already mounting speculation that she's gearing up for a 2020 presidential run, as foreign policy is the biggest hole in her presidential resume. It's been a common platform for the national stage: Hillary Clinton joined the panel in 2003 ahead of her first presidential run. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine \u2014 passed over as President Barack Obama's vice president \u2014 took a seat on the panel when he was elected in 2013, improving his vice presidential resume for 2016. Warren's seat on the committee also gave her a ticket to join McCain, the panel's chairman, on a July congressional trip to Afghanistan. And she took her own foreign trip this past month to Germany, Estonia and Poland. Warren has used her Armed Services perch to outline a case against Trump's foreign policy. In addition to hammering home the State Department budget, Warren has raised climate change as a national security threat with several Pentagon officials and defended  the Iranian nuclear deal . \"A Defense Department report from two years ago observed global climate change will have wide-ranging implications for US national security interests over the foreseeable future,\" Warren said questioning Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. \"In short, this DOD report describes climate change as a threat multiplier. Director Coats, do you agree?\" She has also weighed in on foreign policy issues like Syria and Afghanistan. At a February hearing with the top US commander in Afghanistan, she said she believed the US \"should not be in Afghanistan forever.\" RELATED: Trump to announce 'path forward' for US in Afghanistan \"Our end goal must be to help Afghanistan build a self-sustaining force that's capable of securing the country so our US troops can come home,\" she said. But Warren hasn't just been looking at national and international issues on the committee. She's been sure to tout Massachusetts and the technological prowess the state's companies and universities can provide to the military, particularly from the military's Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUX), a rapid-fire innovation hub set up by former Defense Secretary Ash Carter. \"Do you believe that DOD should strongly weigh the intellectual resources of a region when evaluating where to locate facilities such as DIUX and other research-based commands, especially in situations where the military is partnering with academic and technical organizations?\" Warren asked James Mattis during his confirmation hearing for defense secretary in January. The Massachusetts Democrat has also talked up a focus on technology over traditional military spending. \"I think we should be budgeting our defense resources based on 21st century threats,\" she said. \"I want us to invest smartly, not simply rolling out more of the last century's equipment off the production line.\" Booker: A chance to tackle the Obama playbook Booker's seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is another path for senators harboring presidential ambitions \u2014 it's the committee Obama served on ahead of his 2008 run. In the early months of the Trump administration, the panel gave Booker a seat at the table for some of the most contentious confirmation hearings, including those of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u2014 whose confirmation was very much in doubt for a time \u2014 and US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. Booker's first hearing was Tillerson's marathon confirmation, in which he went after the former Exxon CEO over his criticisms of the Obama administration's alleged weakness toward Russia after the invasion of Crimea. Booker hammered Tillerson for suggesting there should have been a show of military  force and gave insight into his own worldview.  \"You understand that if you put yourself in a defensive posture -- there's an old saying that if you pull a gun, you should be prepared to use it -- that that could've quickly escalated into a conflict,\" Booker said. \"And you're gonna be making decisions about whether we should have commit American troops, commit European troops.\" When Friedman testified, Booker elicited an apology for the nominee's comments suggesting Obama was anti-Semitic and that Kaine was an Israel basher. \"Sir, you and I both from our family histories know a lot about people demeaning folks,\" Booker said. \"We know a lot about hate speech and hate words.\" Booker has raised the same concerns as Warren on the Trump administration's proposal to slash budgets for the State Department and US Agency for International Development, arguing they are just as important as the military in the fight against ISIS. \"It is outrageous to me that you have an administration on one side of their mouth want to talk about being tough against ISIS and against terrorism. But probably what I would say, if you're looking at a toolbox, one of the most critical assets we have is the activities being done to diplomacy, to USAID and through other CVE (countering violent extremism) efforts that are not about a military.\" The New Jersey Democrat has also raised concerns in hearings about Saudi Arabia's role in Yemen, and said he was disturbed that the US military was still fighting terrorism  under the 2001 military authorization , two issues that are of importance to the anti-war wing of the Democratic Party. Booker has not asked questions at nearly two-thirds of the foreign relations panel's hearings, including when Tillerson came back to the committee in June to discuss the State Department's budget. But he has been given a platform to take leadership on Africa issues as the top Democrat on the Africa and Global Health Policy Subcommittee, which has held hearings on conflict minerals and the situation in South Sudan, the latter Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake gave Booker credit for scheduling. Harris: Prosecutor, interrupted Ordinarily, Harris' seat on the Senate intelligence committee would have given her access to key national security and intelligence issues but little opportunity to speak about them. This is no ordinary year. The committee has held more than a dozen open hearings so far this year \u2014 highly unusual for the intelligence panel \u2014 and many of them have been national spectacles, including the  testimony of fired FBI Director James Comey . But Harris generated a wave of headlines of her own after her questioning of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. A former prosecutor, Harris approaches hearings with an aggressive tack that appeared to rankle McCain and the chairman, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr. \"Can you give me a yes-or-no answer, please?\" Harris said to Rosenstin. \"Well, it's not a short answer, senator,\" he responded. \"It is either you are willing to do that or not ...\" she continued, before McCain piped up: \"Mr. Chairman, they should be allowed to answer the question.\" Harris continued to press for a yes-or-no answer until Burr intervened. \"Would the senator suspend? The chair is going to exercise its right to allow the witnesses to answer the question, and the committee is on notice to provide the witnesses the courtesy which has not been extended all the way across \u2014 extend the courtesy for questions to get answered,\" Burr said. The incident sparked  accusations of sexism toward Harris , but the same scenario played out a week later while Harris was questioning Sessions, who accused Harris of trying to rush him. \"I'm not able to be rushed this fast. It makes me nervous,\" Sessions said. RELATED: Once again, senators cut off Harris as she rails on Sessions Harris' questioning style, in some ways similar to another prosecutor-turned-senator, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, was on display during confirmation hearings, too, where she asked nominees for specific commitments. \"Are you willing to commit to this committee that if you come across information that relates to that incident of Russia tampering with the 2016 election, and if you become aware that that information has not been shared with this committee, that you will share it with this committee because it is significant?\" Harris asked CIA General Counsel Courtney Elwood at her April confirmation hearing. In addition to her committee work, Harris made her first trip to the Middle East as a senator in April, visiting Iraq and Jordan. As for Harris' foreign policy positions, the intelligence committee doesn't provide a platform like the Armed Services and Foreign Relations panels, but some of her worldview does come through, including concerns about military spending. \"As we invest in fighter jets and aircraft carriers, Russia is investing in state-run media from which it can push out fake news,\" Harris said at a March hearing. \"As we consider investing more than $600 billion in our defense budget, Russia has approximately one-tenth of that amount in their budget and is developing its cyber warfare capabilities.\" This story has been updated.","articles_date":"21 8 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/08\/21\/politics\/2020-dems-foreign-policy-committee\/index.html","articles_title":"How potential 2020 Democrats are honing their foreign policy chops","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":139,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Legislation to prevent the government from shutting down failed Friday night in the Senate ahead of the midnight deadline.

He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow. Follow him on Twitter:  @ijbailey . The views expressed are his own.  (CNN) Confederate monuments and Confederate flags on public property weren't designed to honor the leaders of the Confederate States of America. They were installed and flown as an everyday reminder to black Southerners, that their homes are not their own, that their bodies can be taken the way their ancestors were, that their voices don't matter. That's  what's changing in New Orleans  as construction workers undertake the work of removing four statues and monuments dedicated to one of the worst periods of US history. It's a long overdue grappling with the reality that many Americans remain comfortable worshipping men who commit great evil. It's more than symbolic that the workers removing the monuments had to wear masks to hide their identities and be protected by a gaggle of armed law enforcement officials and initially do their work under the cover of night because of the threats they've received. It harkens back to the days white violence was used to oppress black Southerners, especially when they dared to make progress at the ballot box, in the classroom, to assert their God-given rights. Corey Stewart, a Republican hoping to be the next governor of Virginia, and others like him are so blinded by their rage, their hatred, they can't see the irony in their protests. \"It appears ISIS has won,\"  Stewart tweeted . \"They are tearing down historical monuments in New Orleans now too. It must end. Despicable!\" He then  tweeted  an image of an ISIS fighter destroying historical monuments in the Middle East next to one doing the same to a statue of an American hero. Stewart doesn't seem to realize that the Confederate-inspired Ku Klux Klan was an American form of ISIS. The Confederate leaders Stewart and others want to forever have places of honor gave rise to a Jim Crow South where systematic lynching, raping, and killing occurred on our soil for longer and caused more damage than ISIS has in the Middle East. Leaving up Confederate flag and monuments built by men honoring that horror would be akin to forcing the victims of ISIS to forever live under the notorious ISIS black flag and live amid monuments and statutes dedicated to \"brave\" ISIS commanders.    In New Orleans, the statues slated for removal depict Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis and P.G.T. Beauregard: three of the most prominent members of the Confederate States of America -- leaders of a movement that committed treason against the U.S. and tried to implement a permanent state of black enslavement. How can we teach our kids to do right while providing special recognition for those who did so much wrong? Also to be removed is the memorial to the Battle of Liberty Place, which was originally erected to mark a deadly failed uprising by the \"Crescent City White League\" and later inscribed with a dedication to \"white supremacy.\" No self-aware public institutions would build monuments to such men today for reasons that are beyond obvious. They don't represent a diversifying American public struggling to live up to its highest ideals. Their most prominent acts threatened the principles upon which we are trying to perfect America. The only question is what should be done about the monuments those who came before us built. Must we forever memorialize how they defined America? I think not. Removing those statues, like renaming buildings that bear their name or taking down the Confederate flag -- and even reexamining the presence of slave owners and slave rapists on our currency -- is a long overdue reckoning with our past.  These statues have no place in public space. Museums are designed to contend with the complexity of these men's legacies, something that can't be practically done with a few lines of text carved into a statue. Don't destroy the monuments; allow the best minds in our best museums to find ways to preserve and display them. It is not about forgetting our past; it is about undoing the whitewashing done by those who came before us. We are well into the 21st century and have yet to find the moral courage to say that if you commit some of the most horrific acts known to man -- owning other human beings, betraying your country to preserve slavery -- you forfeit the right to be remembered on public monuments and statues and currency that should be reserved for only the best among us. The best among us have never been perfect. But they found ways to do as much good and as little bad as possible. They should be our standard bearers, not those too morally weak and too blind to follow their lead.

ADVERTISEMENT Corey Stewart, chairman of the   County, Va., board of supervisors, wanted information from ICE officials to find out how many criminal illegal immigrants referred for deportation are released back into the communities where they were picked up. This comes as a Bolivian native faces charges for killing a nun while drunk driving. \"ICE contacted me this morning, with great news for Prince William County citizens. They have agreed to release to Prince William County the identities and final disposition of every convicted criminal illegal alien apprehended in Prince William County, Virginia and turned over to ICE through the county's 287(g) partnership,\" Stewart said in a statement. Stewart said his county's police referred Carlos Martinelly Montano for deportation twice in the past after he served sentences for drunk driving convictions. But immigration officials released Montano, who allegedly killed Sister Denise Mosier and injured two other nuns in the Aug. 1 accident, on his own recognizance pending a deportation hearing. \"Regardless of which side of the aisle you're on, or on this issue, we can all agree that if you are an illegal alien and you've committed a crime, that you should be deported afterward,\" Stewart told Fox News on Friday. \"But this guy had been twice handed over to immigration officials and twice released back into the community even though there was an immigration detainer on him. And of course he's gone right back out and committed the same crime and killed a nun.\" Stewart accused the Obama administration of a policy of \"deliberately underfunding and understaffing immigration enforcement\" so that officials are left without detention facilities to place illegal aliens who are awaiting deportation after serving time for criminal convictions. \"I want the Obama administration to come clean with the American people about its policy of releasing illegal aliens who localities and other law enforcement officials have identified as illegal aliens who have committed crimes, and the Obama administration is simply turning around and releasing these dangerous individuals back into neighborhoods,\" Stewart said. Montano, who allegedly crashed head-on into the vehicle carrying the three nuns, was arrested and charged for drunk driving, involuntary manslaughter and driving on a revoked license. It is possible he could face a murder charge. On Tuesday,   Secretary   said her department would look into why Montano was out driving.\u00a0 \"He was in removal proceedings; why were the removal proceedings taking so long? I do not, obviously, as of today have the results of that, although I will get them,\" she pledged. Stewart implemented rules in 2006 for Prince William County police officers to check the immigration status of individuals pulled over for suspected crimes. He credited the program with reducing crime rates by 36.6 percent. Crimes such as murder, rape, aggravated assault and robbery have all declined. Stewart said he'd like to see Congress and the president fund facilities to hold illegal immigrants suspected of other crimes in jails throughout their trial phase, and if found guilty, have the illegal immigrant serve time and then be \"deported immediately, not released on his own recognizance like they did here and thousands of other cases across the  . \"This is not a unique or even unusual case -- it's happening every day in virtually every community across this country,\" he said. Already the Senate has taken some action, on Thursday passing a $600 million border security bill that includes $20 million for expanding detention facilities. A similar bill passed the House before the August break.\u00a0 Calls for comment to top members of the House Homeland Security Committee regarding the subpoena demand were not immediately returned. The order of the Benedictine nuns where Sister Mosier belonged issued a statement on its website saying the ministry is saddened that her death \"has been politicized and become an apparent forum for the illegal immigration agenda.\u00a0 \"While grieving and dealing with the death and severe injuries of our sisters, we would like to re-focus attention on the consequences of drinking and driving, and on Christ's command to forgive,\" the statement reads. Stewart said that he appreciates the nuns' reaction to the accident, but he has a different mission. \"The Benedictine sisters, their mission is mercy and love, but my mission, as an elected official, is the protection of my residents and law enforcement. It is my duty and my obligation and I have\u00a0a job to do and I'm going to do it,\" he said.","articles_date":"08 08 2010","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2010\/08\/06\/virginia-official-calls-congress-subpoena-ice-records.html","articles_title":"ICE Agrees to Release Illegal Immigrant Data to Virginia Official","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":147,"issue":5,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"More than 160 foreign nationals -- most of them illegal immigrants with criminal records -- were arrested in northern Virginia over a three-day enforcement surge involving federal, state and local police, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton said Wednesday. ADVERTISEMENT The enforcement sweep, conducted between Sunday and Tuesday, ensnared men and women from 32 countries, including eight people who had been convicted of sex offenses. Morton announced the arrests at a news conference in Manassas, where political leaders have faulted ICE for failing to enforce the nation's immigration laws aggressively enough. \"We are dedicated to the removal of criminal offenders from our country,\" Morton said, arguing that ICE has removed more illegal immigrants from the country in the last two years than it ever had. Morton's announcement failed to impress   County Board of Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart, a vocal critic of what he says is lax federal enforcement of immigration law, who called Wednesday's news conference a \"dog-and-pony show.\" Stewart said the statistics show that ICE routinely fails to detain known illegal immigrants even when they have been convicted of serious crimes, including felonies. He said in Prince William County alone, Prince William authorities have turned over 3,000 criminal aliens to ICE in recent years, and ICE refuses to say whether those people were detained, deported to released back into the community. Stewart suspects that the vast majority were turned loose, based on the fact that Prince William police have ended up re-arresting 346 of them. \"This is certainly not enough,\" Stewart said of the enforcement sweep. \"ICE and the federal government will show that they are serious about dealing with criminal illegal aliens when they begin to hold criminal illegals in custody until they are deported.\" Of the 163 arrests in the recent enforcement action, roughly 130 were people with criminal records -- 85 for felonies and 45 with misdemeanors, Morton said. While the enforcement action targeted illegal immigrants with criminal records, more than 30 of those arrested had no criminal convictions but were nevertheless in the U.S. unlawfully, according to ICE. Morton said that while their focus is criminal aliens, \"we're not going to turn a blind eye\" to others who cross paths with ICE and who are in the country illegally but have not committed any other offense. Stewart said the results of the enforcement surge are misleading. The few statistics that the county has been able to obtain from ICE show that only rarely does ICE detain and deport illegal immigrants for anything but the most serious felonies. While ICE places its highest priorities on those who have committed the most serious crimes, Morton said any criminal offense by a foreign national can make that individual a target for ICE. Several of those arrested, for instance, had legal permanent resident status but committed crimes that make them deportable. \"These are not the kind of people we want walking the streets of our Commonwealth,\" Morton said. Of those arrested, 60 were in Fairfax County, 37 in Prince William County and 20 in Loudoun County. Smaller numbers were arrested in Arlington County, the city of Alexandria and the outlying counties of northern Virginia.","articles_date":"23 03 2011","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2011\/03\/23\/ice-announces-immigration-arrests-northern-va.html","articles_title":"ICE Announces Immigration Arrests in Northern Virginia","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":148,"issue":5,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) One thing strategists in both parties were sure Democrats couldn't do in the 2018 midterm elections is take control of the Senate away from Republicans.  The math just didn't work: Democrats would have to win three seats. There are only two good pick-up opportunities on the map -- Arizona and Nevada. And their incumbents are defending 10 seats in states President Donald Trump won. The House could be won if there is a big anti-Trump turnout, and Democrats hope to pick off governor's offices and state legislatures. But the Senate, they thought, would have to wait for 2020.  Alabama could change all that.   The Washington Post's report  that Republican nominee Roy Moore alleged pursued teenage girls while in his thirties -- which Moore denies -- has led to a chorus of GOP senators conditionally calling on Moore to withdraw from the ballot ahead of the December 12 special election for Attorney General Jeff Sessions' old seat.  \"If these allegations are true, he must step aside,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.  \"The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. \"He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of.\" Moore has given no indication that he'll do so. Alabama law doesn't allow for him to be replaced on the ballot at this stage, anyway. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she talked to Sen. Luther Strange -- the Alabama Republican temporarily appointed to fill Sessions' seat, who lost a primary to Moore -- about running as a write-in candidate.  Moore was already on the record advocating discrimination. He has said homosexuality should be illegal and once wrote that Muslim people shouldn't be allowed in Congress. Those comments plus his removal -- twice -- as Alabama state Supreme Court chief justice has helped Democrat Doug Jones so far run a closer-than-expected race in a deep-red state.  It's not yet clear how badly these allegations will damage Moore.  But there are three things you should know:  1. After Tuesday's blue wave through the Virginia suburbs, Democrats are already incredibly optimistic about the 2018 midterms. 2. Republicans face long, bitter primaries in nearly every state where they hope to knock off Democratic incumbents. And those Democrats haven't had to cast any tough, politically damaging votes since Trump took office.  3. Alabama represents the possible third seat -- the one more they had to have to try to win control of the Senate.  It's not Democrats' only shot at adding one more Republican-held seat to the 2018 battlefield. The party is trying to recruit former Gov. Phil Bredesen into the Tennessee Senate race to replace the retiring Bob Corker, and Rep. Beto O'Rourke hopes Texas will have moved left enough that his race against Sen. Ted Cruz might prove competitive.  But Alabama is now the race to watch. And since its special election is December 12 -- just a little more than a month away -- it won't take long to sort through the fallout of Thursday's bombshell.   As announced on Wednesday, Republican Gov. Kay Ivey is not endorsing Moore -- in accordance, her office said, with a self-imposed policy that began when she took the office in April -- but did plan to vote for him. Asked by CNN Thursday, after the Post story was published, if Ivey would still vote for Moore, a spokesman for Ivey said he was unsure. In a statement released later in the day, Ivey didn't address the question, but called the allegations against Moore \"deeply disturbing\" and said she would \"hold judgment until we know the facts. The people of Alabama deserve to know the truth and will make their own decisions.\" CNN's Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.","articles_date":"9 11 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/11\/09\/politics\/roy-moore-alabama-senate-control-2018-midterms\/index.html","articles_title":"If Democrats can win Alabama, the Senate is in play in 2018","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":149,"issue":8,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) The escalating struggle between the parties over immigration rests on a paradox.   In the battle for control of both Congress and the White House, Republicans rely overwhelmingly on the places in the US that remain the least touched by immigration. Democrats depend primarily on the places with the most immigrants.  That contrast frames the inverse dynamic driving this volatile debate: generally it is the places with the least exposure to immigrants that are seeking to limit future migration, over the objections of the places with the most.  Even that paradox doesn't capture the full complexity of the conflict. At the federal level, Republicans led by President Donald Trump are now urging not only a crackdown on undocumented immigrants, but also the biggest reduction in legal immigration since the 1920s. But simultaneously, more local officials from both parties across the heartland are trying to attract immigrants they consider indispensable to their strategies for maintaining economic vitality and a critical mass of population.   \"My sense is if you talk to local elected officials, policy makers, business owners, faith leaders, they get it -- they completely understand that immigration is what is going to keep them going,\" says Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, and author of the book \"There Goes The Neighborhood,\" which explores how communities across America are adapting to new arrivals. \"But, especially in this day and age, for them to make that case publicly, when the other bullhorn is held by the President, is really, really hard.\"  Trump would trade protection for \"Dreamers\" for drastic cuts in legal immigration Trump has disappointed some conservatives by indicating that he's willing to accept a pathway to citizenship -- albeit an elongated one -- for a substantial portion of the so-called \"Dreamers,\" young people brought to the country illegally by their parents and previously protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. But he has infuriated Democrats and immigrant advocacy groups by tying any potential protection for the Dreamers not only to funding for a border wall and enhanced enforcement measures but also substantial reductions in legal immigration.   In the proposal that Trump is expected to highlight in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, the administration has insisted that any deal for \"Dreamers\" include severe limits on immigration aimed at family reunification -- what conservatives call \"chain migration.\" Trump wants to limit future legal immigration only to the spouses and minor children of American citizens and permanent legal residents. That shift could reduce legal immigration by as much as 40% over time,  according to projections by the Migration Policy Institute . Hard-line legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia in the House  would impose similar reductions on legal immigration , while Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, in legislation Trump has endorsed, have proposed an even deeper cut of 50%. Any of these would represent the biggest reduction in legal immigration since the 1920s.  The voters most resistant to immigration Both in the 2016 primaries and general election, Trump relied preponderantly on support from the voters most resistant to immigration. A majority of Republican voters supported building Trump's proposed border wall  in just two of the 20 states where exit polls measured sentiment  on the question in GOP primaries. Yet that minority of Republicans supported Trump in such overwhelming numbers that they provided a majority of the votes he received in 18 of the 20 states.   In the general election, the exit poll likewise found that just 41% of voters supported building the wall while a 54% majority opposed it. Yet once again Trump won such an overwhelming percentage among the minority that supported the wall (85% of whom voted for him) that they provided about three-fourths of all the votes he received, according to the exit poll.   The share of voters who believed that all undocumented immigrants in the US should be deported, as opposed to receiving legal status, was even smaller: just 25%, according to the exit poll. Yet once again they voted for Trump in such overwhelming numbers (more than four-in-five) that this relatively small group provided about 45% of his total votes.  A reliance on the places with the least exposure to immigration Geographically the contrasts were equally pointed. In both Congress and the Electoral College, the GOP now relies predominantly on the places with the least exposure to immigration.   According to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, in 2016 immigrants exceeded or equaled their 13.5% share of the national population in fourteen states. Trump won just three of them: Florida, Texas and Arizona. Hillary Clinton won the other 11, including eight of the top 10: California, New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, Nevada, Massachusetts, Maryland and Connecticut.  Overall, Clinton carried 16 of the 20 states where people born abroad constitute the largest share of the population. (Georgia was the only other state in the top 20 that Trump carried.)  Trump, in turn, dominated the places with fewer immigrants. He won 26 of the 30 states where immigrants constituted the smallest share of the population. (Minnesota, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine were the only exceptions.) In 19 states, immigrants comprise only one-in-every-20 residents or less. Trump won all of them except for Vermont and Maine. The states on the very bottom of the list for immigrant presence represented some of Trump's strongest: West Virginia, Mississippi, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Alabama, Kentucky and South Dakota.   The same patterns persist in Congress. In the Senate, Democrats now hold 31 of the 40 seats from the 20 states with the highest share of immigrants. That number could increase after November's election: the Democrats' top two Senate targets are Republican-held seats in Nevada and Arizona, which are both among the nine the GOP controls in the high-immigration states. (Democrats have an outside chance at a third Republican senator on that list, Ted Cruz of Texas.)  By contrast, Republicans hold 42 of the 60 Senate seats in the 30 states with the smallest share of immigrants. And that number could rise as well after November. The GOP's top Senate targets this year are almost all Democrats from the low-immigration states, including Missouri, Indiana, North Dakota, Montana and West Virginia. (The one exception is high-immigrant Florida, where Republicans are optimistic that Gov. Rick Scott can oust Democrat Bill Nelson.)  In the House, the contrast is equally stark. Nearly 85% of House Republicans represent seats where the foreign-born share of the population lags below the national average. (In Goodlatte's seat, immigrants comprise only 5% of the population.) Over 60% of House Democrats represent seats where the foreign-born share of the population exceeds the national average. This divergence could widen as well in November. Many of the Democrats' top targets this year include suburban seats in major metropolitan areas with large immigrant populations, such as Orange County CA; Northern Virginia; Miami; and New Jersey.  Democrats do better, and Republicans less well, in states with more immigrants partly because the GOP has struggled so much in recent years with all minority voters, whether native-born or immigrant. But many pollsters also say that unease about demographic change in general, and immigration in particular, often is also greater among whites in the places that are the least directly affected by it.   As  the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute reported  in a nationwide study in 2016, \"Notably, areas of the country that have been historical centers of immigration hold the most positive views of immigrants.\" The most negative attitudes were expressed in the Deep South, Appalachia and parts of the Plains and Mountain States -- areas with generally fewer immigrants.  A new focus on legal immigration The demands from Trump and some GOP legislators in each chamber for cutbacks represent the GOP's first serious attempt to retrench legal immigration since 1996, after the 1994 landslide that swept the party to control of both congressional chambers for the first time in 40 years. That earlier push never generated much momentum: though the House Judiciary Committee approved cutbacks, one-third of House Republicans joined most Democrats to block them on the floor. Just 20 senators supported legal immigration reductions, with three-fourths of Republicans (including John McCain, Orrin Hatch and Mitch McConnell) voting no.  This time, with Trump's vocal support, the effort may accumulate greater support. Yet with the exception of Perdue, few of the Republican senators from the high-immigration states have shown much enthusiasm for a crusade to reduce legal flows. (Late last week, Florida's Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, without directly criticizing the call for legal immigration reductions, pointedly suggested that any legislative package on DACA should be focused narrowly on closely related issues.)  And the push at the national level to reduce legal immigration collides with the increasing interest among local officials, even in many Republican-leaning heartland communities, in recruiting immigrants to stem population loss, particularly among people in the prime working years of 25-64.  The list of cities participating in the non-partisan Welcoming America network, which works with local governments and non-profits to promote the integration of immigrants, testifies to the breadth of interest in attracting new arrivals. The coalition includes not only Seattle and Los Angeles, Austin and Boston, New York and Chicago-big places with a long-standing immigrant heritage. It also encompasses heartland communities where Republicans typically run better than in the big metros: Akron, Toledo and Dayton, Indianapolis, Lincoln and St. Louis, Kalamazoo and Fargo, Nashville and tiny Clarkston, Georgia.   Noorani notes there is a \"dissonance\" between the push to attract immigrants in so many local communities, many of them Republican-leaning, and the escalating demands from national GOP leaders to roll back legal immigration. \"It doesn't mean that what's happening locally is easy, but at the local level, if you've got a good mayor, a good city council, the police chief, the fire department, who are speaking to the values of immigrants to a particular community, that eases the tension,\" he says. \"Right now, it's clearly not the President delivering that message.\"","articles_date":"30 1 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/01\/30\/politics\/immigration-backlash-data\/index.html","articles_title":"Immigration backlash is coming from places least touched by immigration","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":150,"issue":5,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Akhil Reed Amar is a professor of constitutional law at Yale University and the author of \" The Constitution Today .\"  The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.   (CNN) Several leading Republicans are  suggesting  that if Hillary Clinton is elected, she could be  impeached  sometime after inauguration, perhaps in her first year as president.   Echoing these allies, Donald Trump is arguing that a prospect of  impeachment  over the Clinton email controversy or any other Clinton misdeed would mire America in a  constitutional crisis,  and thus he (and  he alone ) is America's salvation. Savvy Democrats should respond to Trump's hyperkinetic attack with jujitsu, using his own furious momentum to expose yet another example of his constitutional clumsiness. First, Democrats should smile and coolly point out that there is no need for Republicans to wait until inauguration. Why not start the grand impeachment parade now?   Casual observers can be forgiven for assuming -- wrongly, as it turns out -- that Clinton can be impeached only for presidential misconduct, and that of course no such misconduct has occurred because she has yet to be president. But in fact, the Constitution's Article II makes all \"civil officers of the United States\" and not just presidents subject to impeachment. True, senators and representatives are not impeachable as such. Technically, they are not \"officers\" within the Constitution's letter and spirit, as illustrated by the language of Article I, Section 6: \"No person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.\"   Precisely because senators cannot \"hold Office\" under this Article I clause, Clinton was constitutionally required to leave the Senate when she became secretary of state in 2009. But as secretary of state she was indeed an \"officer\" and as such, subject to impeachment. Private citizens as such cannot be impeached, nor can members of Congress as such. But Cabinet officers in their capacity as Cabinet officers are fair game in impeachment. The punishment True, Clinton is no longer a Cabinet officer. She is currently a private citizen. But the logic and spirit of Article II make former Cabinet officers fully impeachable, as are other former officers of the US government -- ex-presidents, ex-vice presidents, former judges and former justices, for example.  Why? Because the punishment for impeachment can extend beyond simple removal from office.  Under Article I, Section 3, \"judgment in cases of impeachment\" may include \"disqualification to hold or enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States.\"   Surely an evil officer should not be allowed to escape disqualification by resigning one minute before the sentencing gavel bangs down at the end of his impeachment trial in the Senate. And what is true of someone who resigns one minute ahead of time must also be true of anyone who leaves office at any earlier point -- resigning, perhaps, precisely because the evil officer knows that his misconduct is about to come to light. So Hillary Clinton can indeed be impeached -- now, or any time before Inauguration. She can be impeached for any of her allegedly malignant misdeeds as secretary of state -- whatever those misdeeds might be, in the eyes of her House Republican critics. And the standard for impeachment and conviction is not that she committed a statute-book felony beyond reasonable doubt -- the pro-Clinton standard that FBI Director James Comey propounded back in July when he said that any criminal charges against her would be preposterous (a fact that Trump ignores at every turn). Rather, the standard in impeachment is more intrinsically political. Malicious mischief in office is impeachable even if no felony ever occurred, and the standard of proof need not, perhaps, be as high as in a criminal courtroom.  All this should be music to the ears of Republican extremists: If convicted after she is impeached, Clinton can be completely disqualified from the presidency itself! Trump supporters would say: Hurray for the Constitution! Hooray for the rule of law! Our republic is safe after all. First flaw in the GOP argument But at this point, savvy Democrats should explain two further constitutional points to Trump and to the American public whom Trump is seeking to woo with his glib talk of impeachment.   First, impeachment by the House is an empty gesture unless the Senate follows up with a conviction -- or at least with a trial in which conviction is a realistic possibility -- and scenarios in which the Senate would follow up are altogether fanciful.   Partisan impeachments by the House of Representatives are indeed allowed under the strict letter of the Constitution. The House needs only the barest of majorities to impeach -- in effect, indict -- a sitting or former officer. But nothing horrible really happens to the impeached officer -- no removal from office, and no disqualification from future office-holding -- unless the Senate convicts, and the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote for conviction.   Given that Republicans are now and will for the foreseeable future be more than a dozen votes shy of two-thirds, Clinton would only be imperiled if Democrats turn against her. But current Republican extremists are of course solidifying Democratic solidarity behind her. Democrats are, almost to a person, \"with her,\" as the slogan goes -- and with her all the more because extremist Republicans are so intently and unfairly against her. Hillary Clinton's option And here is the second, even bigger, constitutional flaw in Trump's argument. Should future Republican extremists be so heavy-handed as to try to impeach her, a future President Hillary Clinton could call their bluff by stepping down, temporarily, under the provisions of the 25th   Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment, adopted after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, allows a sitting president to step aside temporarily at any time and for virtually any reason he or she deems proper -- a planned surgery, a family crisis, a political row. Formally, the impeachment process in this scenario would stay precisely on track, unimpaired by this temporary step-aside -- just as if Clinton had not stepped aside on the one hand or had resigned on the other.   By stepping down, temporarily, under this amendment, Clinton would make her loyal running mate, Tim Kaine, the acting president of the United States. Republicans have nothing on Kaine, and by taking over the reins for a while, he would actually improve his chances of being elected president in his own right in 2020 or beyond.   So by giving Clinton a good excuse to boost Kaine, Republicans would be making their own prospects that much harder in future presidential elections, and doubly so -- by looking (and being) themselves extreme and partisan and by making Kaine look (and be) all the more presidential.  Kaine is after all, in some ways a superior version of Clinton -- younger and with less baggage, but utterly loyal to the general Clinton policy agenda. And nothing would stop acting President Kaine from consulting the vacationing Clinton at every turn. Indeed, if Clinton truly wanted to stick it to her critics and make them eat crow, she could smilingly step aside, temporarily, and make it clear that she will formally resume power and take back the reins under the 25th Amendment only if her critics themselves formally recant and ask her -- beg her! -- to put Kaine back in the second slot. (Kaine himself reacted to the impeachment talk by  pointing out  that Republicans who engage in it are suggesting it's likely their candidate will lose to Clinton.)  Once we understand how a clever President Clinton would and should react to overheated Republican extremists, we see how Trump and his allies are -- as they so often are -- mistaken in their bullheaded constitutional claims. No crisis need ensue should Clinton be impeached or should serious impeachment rumblings ever occur. Clinton herself has ensured this by picking a sound, steady and policy-compatible running mate fully capable of being president at any moment -- possessing precisely the sober presidential temperament, extensive training and cool judgment that Trump himself obviously lacks, as evidenced by his latest rampage. Wielding power by giving it up Sometimes, the best way to wield power is, at first, to give it up. Caesar at first pushed away the diadem and George Washington immortalized himself with brilliantly executed resignations (first from the Continental Army, later from the presidency itself). Back when Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998, I  argued  in the New Republic  that he should publicly step aside under the 25th Amendment and let Al Gore take over for a while. Many readers thought I was being cutesy, but I was in dead earnest.   Such a move, I argued back then, could have helped both Clinton and Gore. Indeed I claimed in early 1999 that a Clinton-to-Gore handoff under the 25th Amendment could improve Gore's chances to be elected in his own right in 2000. With the benefit of hindsight, I think I called it right.  (I tell the back story in my new  book .)  The last president Clinton, when impeached, declined my free advice. (He was acquitted by the Senate, saw his approval ratings go up and served out his full term.)  The next president Clinton, should she too be impeached, should do what her husband didn't: step aside, temporarily, and boost the veep. But for now, my most important piece of advice is to my fellow citizens who will soon head to the polls: Pay no attention to Trump's latest sales pitch that because she might be impeached, we must instead vote for him. Here as on many other topics, Trump has not thought things through and does not know what he is talking about.","articles_date":"5 11 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/11\/04\/opinions\/impeach-hillary-clinton-talk-is-wacky-opinion-amar\/index.html","articles_title":"Impeach Hillary Clinton?

In the Indiana Senate primary, the bruising fight is over which candidate is the more authentically Trumpian. As the May 8 primary election approaches, the race here has taken a nasty turn, with candidates attacking one another as insufficiently aligned with the president, or way too late to Team Trump. Some Republicans worry that the tenor has the potential to bloody the winner so badly that he will be weakened in the general election contest against Senator Joe Donnelly, one of this election year\u2019s most vulnerable Democrats. \u201cOf course it helps Donnelly,\u201d said Robert T. Grand, a lawyer and powerful figure in state politics for decades. \u201cAny division in the Republican Party helps Donnelly.\u201d The Indiana primary is among several, including those in West Virginia and Wisconsin, where Republicans are locked in nominating battles in states Mr. Trump won in 2016 and where the party has hoped to add to its slender two-seat majority. In Wisconsin, a Marine Corps veteran and political newcomer, Kevin Nicholson, is taking on a state senator, Leah Vukmir, for the right to challenge the incumbent senator, Tammy Baldwin. Both have deep-pocketed donors ready to bankroll an extended primary fight. In West Virginia, a half-dozen Republicans want to challenge Senator Joe Manchin III, but three have emerged as the most formidable in a drawn-out battle, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, Representative Evan Jenkins  and the former mining executive Don Blankenship , who went to prison for the deadly Upper Big Branch coal mining disaster in 2010 but emerged unrepentant. Winning in all three of these states has taken on added urgency after the unanticipated retirements of Republican senators in Tennessee, Arizona and Mississippi left open seats that could suddenly be competitive. In Indiana, Representative Todd Rokita started airing a television ad this week that labeled one of his opponents, Representative Luke Messer, a \u201cNever Trump lobbyist\u201d and the other, Mike Braun, a business executive, as voting for either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. His slogan: \u201cDefeat the Elite.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate three-way race,\u201d said John Hammond, a lawyer and member of the Republican National Committee from Indiana, \u201cand everybody will probably go right up to the line with rhetoric and negative message. It\u2019s happening and it\u2019s intensifying.\u201d He added, \u201cAll the opposition research will have been done for Joe Donnelly at that point.\u201d Mr. Rokita said he had no concerns that the attacks would help the incumbent Democrat. \u201cI think this primary is very cleansing,\u201d he said. \u201cI want voters to know about these two guys. And I want them to know about me.\u201d Referring to two previous Republican presidential candidates, John R. Kasich and Mitt Romney, Mr. Rokita added: \u201cMesser at this point is like all losing candidates, like Kasich or Romney, \u2018if you beat up on me, we are all going to lose.\u2019 Absolutely wrong. I am not waiting for Joe Donnelly to stick a knife in Luke Messer or Mike Braun in November. I am getting it all out now. Because Donnelly will stick in a knife in them.\u201d That kind of language has prompted concern among some of the state\u2019s most influential Republicans. Mr. Grand, who supports Mr. Messer, was particularly critical of Mr. Rokita trying to claim a populist mantle by deriding so-called elites. Mr. Rokita\u2019s \u201celites\u201d are something else to Mr. Grand: \u201cPeople that know what\u2019s good for the Republican Party, yes, longstanding Republicans, yes. People who know how to elect Republican candidates.\u201d \u201cOr,\u201d he asked, does Mr. Rokita \u201cwant to go back to the group that gave us Mourdock?\u201d That was a reference to Richard E. Mourdock, a candidate whose backing from Tea Party groups and national conservative organizations six years ago led to the  defeat of a   longtime incumbent Republican, Senator Richard G. Lugar , in the Indiana primary. Mr. Mourdock went on to  lose to Mr. Donnelly . Mr. Mourdock painted Mr. Lugar as out of touch with the state, and emphasized the fact that he lived in Virginia, a theme that Mr. Rokita has reprised against Mr. Messer. He has also made an issue of the fact that Mr. Messer\u2019s wife, a lawyer, is on the payroll of an Indianapolis suburb even though she, too, lives in Virginia. Mr. Messer, the father of two teenage daughters, said he was raised by a single parent and felt it important to be closer to his children, and said voters would understand. A competitive primary or multicandidate field can sometimes actually reflect party strength and enthusiasm, but if the contest becomes too negative, the party can suffer. \u201cWhere there are particularly competitive or divisive primaries, it is bad for the parties when they go to the general,\u201d said Andrew B. Hall, a political scientist at Stanford University who has studied the subject. \u201cThings are getting put on record that make you look weak. You alienate some of your own base. You\u2019ve expended some of your resources.\u201d Mr. Donnelly has no serious opposition for the Democratic nomination, though he is already under assault from Republican-aligned groups that are spending millions of dollars to defeat him. Each of the Republican candidates has tried to emphasize ties to Mr. Trump in  a state   the president won by 19 percentage points . Mr. Braun claims a Trump-like background, having built a logistics company in southern Indiana that now employs 850 people and gave him wealth that he can spend heavily on his own campaign. He said Mr. Messer and Mr. Rokita were professional politicians, lawyers who \u201cnever practiced\u201d but always had their eyes on the next political rung. Mr. Braun served briefly in the State Legislature. In a candidate debate, in which Mr. Braun wore jeans and a denim shirt, he made the case harshly. In a new ad, he uses humor, carrying cardboard cutouts of the two men \u2014 dressed identically in white shirt, red tie and dark suit \u2014 and asked voters if they could tell the difference between them. \u201cWhere is your real world experience?\u201d Mr. Braun said in an interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any.\u201d He added: \u201cThey are creating a large avenue up the middle between two career politicians. That was a gift that kept on giving.\u201d Mr. Braun dismissed Mr. Rokita as a \u201csmash mouth.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll do and say things that might impress,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he\u2019s trying to act like Trump it\u2019s kind of a poor impression.\u201d He also said there could be lingering damage: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got sharp elbows, that creates a long memory for the people hit by those elbows.\u201d He rejected Mr. Rokita\u2019s charge that he was a recent Republican convert, saying he had never voted for a Democrat for a federal office. Mr. Messer, whose campaign so far has been the most measured of the three, accused Mr. Rokita of \u201ctrying to make things up.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Mr. Messer said. \u201cYou can\u2019t find one interview in the entire campaign where I didn\u2019t make the point that we need to elect President Trump. Do I agree with every single President Trump tweet? No. I\u2019ve expressed a few times my concerns about the president. But throughout, I have supported him and voted for the president in the primary.\u201d All the candidates embrace some of the president\u2019s core positions, like the need for a wall along the Mexican border, and all pledge to be a solid voice for the president\u2019s agenda. Mr. Rokita\u2019s opponents say his voting record suggests otherwise: Mr. Rokita voted against the budget deal that Mr. Trump signed this year He said he did so because the bill contained too much federal spending. But, Mr. Rokita added, because he supported Mr. Trump before his rivals and has the endorsement of people who ran the Trump campaign in the state, he can disagree with the president, something he said Mr. Messer could not do. \u201cNow he has to do everything he can to pander to the president and Mike Pence,\u201d Mr. Rokita said. \u201cOh, the president wanted this terrible spending bill. Whereas I, in a very healthy way, can say no to things like the spending bill and still be on the side of the president.\u201d Even with all the friction in the primary so far, if there are safe places for the midterm elections to be a referendum on Mr. Trump, Indiana is surely among them. Republicans will pour extraordinary resources into the effort to oust Mr. Donnelly, and the president and Vice President Mike Pence, the former Indiana governor, will be able to give the senate nominee added firepower. That gives Republicans comfort that they can endure a fractious primary. \u201cPeople are very energized,\u201d Mr. Grand said. \u201cThey are not playing into this thing that \u201918 is going to be a bad year.\u201d","articles_date":"2 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/02\/us\/politics\/republican-senate-primary-fights-indiana.html","articles_title":"In Indiana and Beyond, Bruising G.O.P.

A bird spooked, was shot with precision, got picked up by a dog and promptly stuffed into the back of a hunter's vest. The President of the United States' eldest son had gotten another.  Donald Trump Jr. was the guest of honor at Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King's annual Col. Bud Day Pheasant Hunt on Saturday, kicking off the 2017 hunting season at the Hole 'N the Wall Lodge here in Akron, a couple miles from the South Dakota border. The two-day hunt, a campaign fundraiser for King, garners a few dozen hunters and about hundred guests for a Saturday evening pork chop and deep-fried pheasant dinner at the lodge. Trump traveled to the lodge late Friday evening, flying commercial on American Airlines to Sioux City with a layover at Chicago O'Hare, where CNN spotted an incognito Patagonia pullover-clad Trump grabbing a quick dinner at the food court. Once he arrived, Trump regaled a group of hunters, including King and Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert, with late-night stories of his life on the 2016 campaign trail, when he was a top surrogate for his father's presidential campaign.  \"Don Jr. just held court. It was just a lot of fun,\" King told reporters after the morning hunt, calling Trump \"witty.\" Trump did not speak to reporters Saturday and maintained his distance from cameras. Trump, who joined the President at an appearance and met with the Trump-aligned America First Policies super PAC in Dallas, Texas, earlier this week, is expected to continue as a key surrogate for his father in 2020, as well as Republicans across the country during the 2018 midterm campaign.  The weekend hunt comes as a federal grand jury in Washington on Friday  approved  the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, according to sources briefed on the matter. Plans were prepared Friday for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as Monday, the sources said. Trump's  June 2016 meeting  at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer has been part of Mueller's ongoing probe.  Asked whether Trump indicated any concern about a potential indictment or his father's impeachment, King dismissed the idea as a \"ridiculous proposal.\" \"We didn't even bring that up because we're not concerned either,\" the Iowa congressman said, adding, \"There's always a chance of anything like the sun coming up, but no, there's no substance.\" Trump and his younger brother, Eric, are both hunters, learning the sport from their maternal grandfather, Dedo.  \"Dedo was a true outdoorsman, and it's because of him that my brothers learned to hunt and fish and hike. If it had been up to my father, they would have been out on the golf course or playing tennis, but they really took to Dedo's pursuits,\" sister Ivanka Trump wrote in her 2009 memoir.  The pursuits paid off: King described Trump as a \"very, very good shot.\" \"Nobody had to back up Don Jr.,\" King said of the first hunt, which warmed up from 17 to 42 degrees over the course of the morning. \"It was a beautiful, clear, still day in Iowa and the sky was so filled with feathers one could be convinced the angels were having pillow fights.\" Fellow hunter Gohmert echoed his praise of Trump's skills: \"Guy's a great shot \u2014 he knows what he's doing, he knows ammunition, he knows weapons, and I'm very impressed,\" the Texas Republican said.  The eight-year hunt tradition, which King described as \"as Iowan as it can get,\" has included a wide swath of GOP presidential hopefuls making their pitch in conservative northwest Iowa ahead of the caucuses over the years, including 2016 candidates Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee and Bobby Jindal.  The hunters were briefed on safety and also instructed about one strictly enforced rule: \"Whenever the gun goes off and a bird folds, you have to always say, 'Nice shot, congressman,'\" King joked.  Gohmert interjected: \"And then that was modified: Let's include, 'Nice shot, Mr. Trump.'\" CNN's Pamela Brown, Evan Perez and Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.","articles_date":"28 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/28\/politics\/donald-trump-jr-pheasant-hunt\/index.html","articles_title":"In Iowa, Donald Trump Jr. focuses on the hunt","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":153,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) When Sen. Bernie Sanders did this in 2013, he did it alone. On Wednesday, nearly four years later, Sanders introduced a new \"Medicare for all\" health care bill with a third of the Senate Democratic caucus by his side. Flanked at first by New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Sanders called the costs of the current system \"insane and unaffordable,\" promising that the average family would benefit financially under his plan \"because you will no longer be writing checks to private insurance companies.\" For those whose taxes would go up, he added, \"that expense will be more than offset by the money are you are saving with the elimination of private insurance costs.\"  Sanders said he planned to take the bill on the road to \"every state in the country and hear what the people have to say\" for a roving national workshop. But the outreach came with a warning. He fired a shot across the bow of Republicans likely to oppose the bill, saying the GOP had \"no credibility on the issue of health care.\"  \"To my Republican colleagues, please don't lecture us on health care,\" Sanders roared to applause from the dozens of activists in the room. \"In the last few months, you, the Republican Party have shown the American people what you stand for\" by largely voting to dismantle Obamacare. Taking her turn, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren framed the push for single payer as the latest step in a long liberal project to expand access to medical care -- from Franklin Roosevelt's social security to Medicare and Medicaid under Lyndon Johnson and, most recently, Barack Obama's signature legislation. \"But we are here today to take another step,\" she said. \"We will not back down in our protection of the Affordable Care Act, we will defend it at every turn, but we will go further -- we will go further and we will say that in this country, everyone gets the right to basic health care.\" Before Sanders' remarks, supporters shared personal, often visceral accounts of doctors currently struggling to provide care and patients in need. An oncology nurse drew gasps in the room as she recounted the story of a cancer patient who could not afford to continuously empty the fluid building up in her lungs. The price of drainage bags, she said, was only covered in part by insurance, forcing the woman to ration her use. The legislation unveiled on Wednesday afternoon in Washington arrived a little more than six weeks after the party's all-hands fight to preserve Obamacare  secured a narrow reprieve on the Senate floor . Sanders' plan, though dead-on-arrival in a Republican-controlled Congress, offers a blueprint for fundamentally reshaping the American health care system by moving the country to a government-run, single-payer program. Under Sanders' proposal, Americans would receive a \"Universal Medicare card\" that would be a ticket to comprehensive health care services, including hospital stays, doctor visits, substance abuse treatment, dental, vision and reproductive care -- including abortion. However, consumers may have to pay up to $250 out-of-pocket for prescription drugs, with incentives to use generic medications. Sanders, who's been vocal about lowering drug prices, would allow the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. Long-term care, which Sanders had included in the version he unveiled during his presidential campaign last year, will not be covered. It will be addressed in separate legislation, an adviser to Sanders told CNN. The bill calls for the elimination of premiums for private health insurance, deductibles and co-pays. However, most Americans and businesses will pay what Sanders says is a much smaller share of their income to fund the program. While the new legislation has not yet been scored, the program Sanders pitched on the campaign trail came with an estimated annual price tag of nearly $1.4 trillion, to be paid for in part by a proposed new 2.2% income tax on all Americans, a 6.2% levy on employers and a further round of tax hikes on the wealthy. California Sen. Kamala Harris made the business-friendly case for single-payer. (Or, as one leftist activist in the room grumbled afterward, \"the neoliberal case.\") \"Let's give the taxpayer of the United States a better return on their investment,\" she said. \"Why? Because 'Medicare for all' stands for the proposition that all Americans from the day of birth, throughout their lives, will have access to health care.\" The talk on Wednesday was broad, with little mention of the financial mechanics needed to propel such a massive program. But Sanders' plan does address one of the stickier questions facing such proposals: how to phase out the current system, which depends primarily on employer-sponsored private plans, without creating a disruption in care. The answer, according to this new version of the bill, is to roll it out over a four-year transition period, a process Gillibrand and her office had a big hand in crafting. The law would beef up Medicare -- adding dental, vision and hearing aid coverage -- in its first year, while reducing the eligibility age to 55. Children, up to age 18, would also be offered immediate access to the government-run plan. Over the next two years, the Medicare age would drop to 45, then 35 years old. By the fourth year, everyone would be eligible. Despite the considerable legislative obstacles in its way, single-payer as a concept is gaining traction among the public. Some  53% of Americans support a national health care plan , according to a June poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That's up from 50% last year and from 40% between 1998 and 2000. It is also notably increasing in popularity with some of the most ambitious Democratic officeholders -- a group of Senators possibly looking to run for the party's presidential nomination in 2020. Harris was the first to announce plans to cosponsor the bill, followed by Warren. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Gillibrand made their plans public on Monday and Tuesday. The names, some expected, others less so, rolled in right up to a few hours before the event, when New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced her support.   Notable absences, however, included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the party's 2016 vice presidential nominee, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Of the latter three, all up for reelection in 2018, only Brown is expected to face a serious Republican challenge. Single-payer activists, mostly from the progressive grassroots movement that fueled Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, are delighting in a sense of momentum after years stuck on the margins of the debate. \"This is an especially gratifying moment for the tens of thousands of nurses across the US who have dedicated years of effort to transform our health care system from an profiteering industry based on greed and suffering to patient need and healing,\" National Nurses United Executive Director RoseAnn DeMoro said in a statement. She called the bill's introduction a \"direct product of how Sen. Sanders made Medicare for all, and healthcare as a human right, such a signature issue of his campaign.\"","articles_date":"13 9 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/09\/13\/politics\/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-plan-details\/index.html","articles_title":"Inside Bernie Sanders' new 'Medicare for all' bill","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":154,"issue":2,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) The next step in Steve Bannon's scorched-earth war against Republican incumbents is an attempt to cut off money to those aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  The former chief strategist in President Donald Trump's White House spent the weekend in Connecticut meeting with top Republican donors, a source familiar with Bannon's plans said, as he recruits financial support for enough candidates to nationalize an anti-establishment message in 2018 GOP primaries. He's held similar meetings in New York City and Washington, speaking with more than 25 major GOP donors so far, including hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, energy executive Dan Eberhart, private equity firm CEO John Childs and mega-donors Robert and Rebekah Mercer.   It was a continuation of what he's done every day since September 26, when the Bannon-backed former judge Roy Moore ousted Sen. Luther Strange in an Alabama Republican primary: Hold meetings to recruit candidates and form a donor network to back them.  Bannon's raison d'etre is to take on McConnell and nationalize Republicans behind Trump. His thinking -- evidenced by the Senate's failure to advance Trump agenda items like health care -- is that Washington Republicans do not support Trump anyway. So 2018 could be a defining moment, shaking up the GOP and placing Trump's 2016 campaign agenda at its forefront.  What Bannon is seeking from prospective candidates, the source said, is one simple pledge: That they won't vote for McConnell as Senate majority leader.  Bannon's recruiting efforts have intensified over the last two weeks. He is now looking for candidates who can replicate Sen. Mike Lee's stunning ouster of former Sen. Robert Bennett at Utah's 2010 Republican convention next year against Sen. Orrin Hatch. And he is in contact with allies in Nebraska seeking a candidate to take on Sen. Deb Fischer.  And that's \"just a partial list,\" the source familiar with Bannon's plans said.  \"Nobody's safe,\" the source said. Already, he had spoken with Erik Prince, the Blackwater security contractor, and GOP mega-donor Foster Friess about running against Republican Sen. John Barrasso in Wyoming.  Bannon has also backed Kelli Ward's effort to oust Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. He hosted Danny Tarkanian in Washington to discuss his campaign against Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada. And he met recently with Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel about taking on Sen. Roger Wicker. McDaniel, who said he is strongly considering running against Wicker, said Monday that he and Bannon have been in regular contact since 2014, when McDaniel came close to unseating Sen. Thad Cochran. Support from Bannon is helpful, McDaniel said, with strong Trump supporters who know Bannon was a leading figure on the President's campaign and with those who read Breitbart.com, where Bannon is a top executive.  \"You factor in the big news he made in 2016,\" McDaniel said. \"You factor in his drive, his work ethic -- and people sense a winner and understand he can bring resources to bear, whether it's Breitbart or with financial resources.\" Bannon also plans to get involved in the primaries in West Virginia and Missouri, two of Republicans' top opportunities to pick off Democratic-held seats next year. The plan, the source said, is for these Bannonites to nationalize their 2018 message with a consolidated, consistent argument across the map.  Bannon wants that message to be about \"big things\" -- that the grassroots Republican voters are in control and that they don't need the establishment's money or what he views as its corruption.  Avoiding another O'Donnell Bannon, the source said, believes his insurgent slate will be different than the tea party calamity of 2010, when flawed candidates like Christine O'Donnell in Delaware and Sharron Angle in Nevada cost the party seats, or 2012, when Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana made controversial remarks that swung their races in Democrats' favor.  Instead, Bannon, the source said, is recruiting candidates who are focused on substance -- particularly immigration and trade -- and could win over a loose coalition of social conservatives, tea party activists and values voters.  The test case was Alabama, where Moore -- a controversial figure who was twice ousted as state Supreme Court chief justice, first for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument and later for refusing to recognize the US Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage -- defeated Strange, who benefited from $10 million in advertising from the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC.  In Alabama, Bannon broke with Trump, who had gone to Huntsville for a campaign rally for Strange just days before the election.  But the two are still in frequent contact. Bannon spoke to Trump in recent days, the source said, arguing that from Trump's perspective the Senate is already lost because the President understands he has little support there.  As if to underscore that view, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker -- the Senate foreign relations committee chairman who is retiring rather than running for re-election in 2018 -- accused Trump  in a New York Times interview  of putting the nation on a path to World War III and said Trump's presidency \"would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.\" It was Corker who had urged Trump in a White House meeting to go to Alabama and campaign for Strange -- a decision the President came to regret -- according to a source who spoke to the President. Bannon, meanwhile, has argued he is taking on Republicans who don't support Trump's policies.  Where's money coming from? One source of financial support for Bannon-backed candidates is the Great America PAC, a super PAC led by former Ronald Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins.  The group plans to roll out an initial set of three endorsements of Republican candidates this week.    It isn't expected to be as aggressive in seeking to unseat Republican incumbents as Bannon has been, but the super PAC does intend to support Senate candidates who back Trump's agenda and call for the elimination of the Senate's 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster -- potentially including Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel, Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale, West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey and more.  It could also support candidates who could weaken Democratic senators seen as potential 2020 Trump opponents, including Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts.  \"The reality here is, you have to tap into that Trump agenda intensity. And those are the candidates who can win in the general election,\" said Eric Beach, the Great America PAC co-chair.  Bannon, meanwhile, is focused on damaging people who might be considering 2020 in both parties -- including Mitt Romney, who could run for the Senate in Utah if Hatch retires.  The key, the source familiar with Bannon's plans said, \"is to prove the theory of the case\" -- that Republicans who are anti-Trump should be gone.","articles_date":"10 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/10\/politics\/steve-bannon-war-against-mitch-mcconnell\/index.html","articles_title":"Inside Steve Bannon's war against Mitch McConnell","candidate_fk":5,"first_name":"Patrick","id":155,"issue":6,"last_name":"Morrisey","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Top Trump campaign brass spent the summer of 2016 grappling with how to build a digital operation for the general election and came upon a possible solution:  Cambridge Analytica . But not everyone was sold on the company that's now at the center of controversy over its use of voter data, including during the  hotly contested 2016 campaign . Paul Manafort, then the campaign chairman, worried that the data firm was \"full of shit.\" Manafort emailed a fellow political operative to get his read on Cambridge. The operative, Doug Watts, worked with the firm during  Ben Carson's  presidential campaign and told Manafort he was unimpressed, according to sources familiar with the exchange. Manafort shared his assessment, the sources said.  The Trump campaign hired the firm anyway. Much of the scrutiny on Cambridge has focused on the seemingly unethical practices it used to collect Facebook data and potentially influence American voters. But Manafort, who is now under indictment by special counsel  Robert Mueller  and has pleaded not guilty, was suspicious for another reason: He didn't trust Cambridge with access to the Trump campaign's data, according to multiple sources familiar with his thinking. Scrutiny of Cambridge is growing as top officials from the firm  claim credit for President Donald Trump's  stunning 2016 victory. While campaign aides have an incentive now to distance themselves from the controversial firm, they insist they had misgivings about Cambridge early in the campaign -- even if they didn't follow through on them. And they're punching back at the notion that Cambridge played anything more than a bit role in the campaign.  \"When you think about the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million votes, but won the Electoral College, that's down to the data and the research,\" Alex Tayler, Cambridge's chief data officer, said in undercover footage by Channel 4 News aired in the UK this week. \"That's how he won the election.\" Brad Parscale, the digital director for Trump's 2016 campaign and campaign manager for his 2020 re-election bid, slammed the firm on Twitter for taking credit for Trump's victory. \"So incredibly false and ridiculous,\" he said, declaring Cambridge's comments \"an overblown sales pitch.\" Former Trump campaign officials insist they never relied on Cambridge for voter targeting or persuasion. And they say the Trump team never bought into the so-called \"psychographic method\" Cambridge chief executive Alexander Nix was peddling to US political campaigns. Trump campaign officials including Parscale were more complimentary about the firm's role immediately following the 2016 victory. During a December 2016 forum hosted by Google, Parscale inferred that Cambridge provided a much-needed infusion of data staff for a bare-bones campaign. Parscale noted that \"Cambridge actually provided a full time employee that could sit next to me all day\" and help digest data. Cambridge didn't comment for this story, but has rejected Channel 4's reporting as edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of the conversations that took place. It has also denied misusing Facebook data, saying in a March 17 statement that the firm \"only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly.\" Courting the Trump campaign Armed with a polished sales pitch, Nix was looking to sell the novel \"psychographic method\" to GOP presidential hopefuls during the 2016 campaign. In theory, Cambridge could wrap in data from Facebook and other sources to model someone's personality type and suggest how they could best be swayed.  Nix was a slick salesman promising phenomenal returns. But he was a salesman, not a scientist. Data experts who saw his presentation said they were dubious of the science behind the product. Political operatives had their own concerns: Data security and wariness about the firm's work with multiple campaigns simultaneously. In spite of those reservations, GOP hopefuls had a compelling reason to bring Cambridge on board. Robert Mercer, a Republican megadonor, had invested $5 million in the data company. Knowing the Mercer family would continue to be a force in GOP politics, campaign operatives didn't want to do anything that would alienate them.  Mercer didn't comment for this story.  Cambridge began courting the Trump campaign early on, making at least three unsuccessful overtures in early 2015 and 2016, according to a source familiar with the conversations. In the meantime, Cambridge inked deals with the presidential campaigns of Carson, now the secretary of housing and urban development, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, according to Federal Election Commission data and campaign operatives. It wasn't until the summer of 2016 that Cambridge caught traction in Trump Tower. One of Parscale's campaign bosses encouraged him to reach out to Cambridge for help building a general election-style data operation. Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner suggested that was at his direction in a post-campaign  interview with Forbes magazine . \"Because we had to ramp up for digital fundraising. We brought in Cambridge Analytica. I called some of my friends from Silicon Valley who were some of the best digital marketers in the world,\" Kushner told Forbes last year. Parscale came away from his initial meeting in June 2016 hoping to poach one of Cambridge's data gurus, according to a source familiar with the encounter. Instead, the two entities struck a deal. The Trump campaign signed on with Cambridge Analytica and brought five staff members to San Antonio, where Parscale's own outside firm, Giles Parscale, was based and where much of the Trump data operation was actually located. The firm was brought on over the objection of several campaign aides and consultants, who were familiar with the kind of psychographic profiling that Cambridge had done for the Cruz super PAC and other political groups. Some thought the profiling was flawed, particularly because Cambridge did a poor job incorporating basic voter behavior data, such as whether a voter participated in the previous caucuses or primaries. At the time, the Republican National Committee was still reeling at the prospect of long-shot candidate Trump becoming the GOP nominee. Trump campaign officials were looking for a backstop in case the RNC failed to throw the weight of its fundraising and data operations behind Trump in the general election. The campaign tapped Cambridge to build out a database of small-dollar GOP donors, a dataset the company had from its prior work for the Cruz and Carson campaigns. As the summer rolled on, it became clear the RNC would offer Trump its full backing, with a promise to share data and other get-out-the-vote information that it had been building for years. It was also becoming evident internally that Cambridge's data models weren't particularly reliable, according to campaign sources involved. In late summer 2016, campaign officials pitted a Cambridge model against one from the RNC. The goal was to identify potential Trump supporters. Both models relied on the same raw data set from the RNC, according to two former campaign officials. But the RNC's outcome was far more accurate. \"Cambridge failed miserably,\" one former campaign official said. \"At that point it was sort of like, OK, the emperor has no clothes.\" But in the Google forum in December 2016, Parscale said Cambridge ultimately became involved in daily polling for the campaign, known as tracking polls, helping supplement the two other sets of polling data that he would examine at any one time. It helped streamline the decision-making process so the campaign could determine where to invest its resources.  Cambridge also used RNC data to build data visualization tools that helped determine where to send Trump for campaign rallies, according to a source familiar with the arrangement. All told, the Trump campaign paid Cambridge just under $6 million, according to FEC records. The largest payment to Cambridge Analytica - $5 million on September 1, 2016 - was made about two weeks after Steve Bannon was appointed the chief executive of the Trump campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records. One former campaign official said it was for a television ad buy.  Bannon recently fell out of favor with the Mercer family after his critical comments about the President and his family members in Michael Wolff's book \"Fire and Fury,\" which was published earlier this year. But Bannon once enjoyed a close relationship with the Mercer family. He had served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge from June 2014 to August 2016, according to a financial disclosure report that he filed with the federal government after joining the Trump administration. Among his assets, he listed a stake with Cambridge worth between $1 million and $5 million. The income section of the disclosure form also said Bannon's consulting firm received $125,333 from Cambridge. It's unclear whether he reaped any benefits from the $5 million ad buy. But Cambridge apparently botched that too, according to people familiar with the situation. When commercials started appearing on television in liberal Washington, D.C., the campaign decided to move its ad buying to a different firm, according to senior Trump officials.   Bannon didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. The flawed psychographic method Over and over again, Cambridge failed to live up to its own hype, according to political operatives who worked with the firm. When Nix approached the Carson campaign, he touted his product as an opportunity for Carson to target his grass-roots supporters and build a small-dollar donor base. After Carson officially jumped into the race, the campaign compared the return it was getting from Cambridge with its other fundraising networks. \"It's fair to say that we probably could have used the white pages - the phone book - and gotten a higher rate of return than we did with the expense of working with Cambridge,\" said Watts, who worked as the communications director for Carson's presidential campaign in 2015.   Still, the campaign continued to use Cambridge's services throughout 2015 and into early 2016. It paid the firm roughly $438,000, according to FEC records. The firm was working with Cruz's campaign over the same period. In a similar head-to-head test, Cambridge's voter modeling program failed up against the campaign's internal data operation. \"They may have believed it was accurate. I never believed it was accurate,\" a former Cruz official said of Cambridge's psychographic models. \"It's far more useful to me to know whether you voted in Republican or Democrat in the 2016 primary versus whether you liked Taylor Swift on Facebook.\" The Cruz campaign decided it would design its own voter algorithms going forward. But it kept working with Cambridge and paid the firm $5.8 million over the 2016 cycle, according to FEC records.  Officials from both the Cruz and Trump campaigns said the firm gave them access to sharp data scientists who could contribute to their operations even if the campaigns weren't using the company's psychographic product.

Those behind the Virginia proposals, including a proposed statewide law, are hoping their state can avoid the kind of public relations and legal pitfalls that have, at least temporarily, ensnared Arizona.\u00a0 \"This is good policy. ... It's both constitutional and prudent,\" said Robert Marshall, the Republican state delegate who originally requested the ruling from Cuccinelli, who is also a Republican. \"Our actions here can't be dismissed.\"\u00a0 Marshall told FoxNews.com he has asked Republican Gov.   to issue an executive order codifying what Cuccinelli wrote. He expressed doubt that any single piece of legislation will pass through the state Senate, but he suggested a carefully worded directive could help shape the national debate.\u00a0 He said Arizona went astray by requiring law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status. Cuccinelli describes Virginia's policy as discretionary.\u00a0 \"Unlike Arizona, you wouldn't say every time you stop somebody, do this,\" Marshall said. \"I think that was one of the reasons the Arizona law was (blocked).\" Marshall said he's confident Virginia's policy would be held up in court if challenged.\u00a0 Cuccinelli also cited that difference as a key distinction between the two laws.\u00a0 \"The difference, of course, is that the Arizona law enforcement officer is going to be under the cloud of the requirement of that statute,\" he said. \"But the way we operate it here, we're in good shape.\"\u00a0 A spokesman for Arizona Gov.   said the governor is reviewing her state's law to see if it can be refined in light of the court decision blocking key parts of it, but was not sure whether she was considering the possibility of making immigration checks discretionary as opposed to mandatory.\u00a0 Though Cuccinelli's ruling drew widespread attention, it's unclear how much direct impact it will have on Virginia law enforcement.\u00a0 Virginia Senate Majority Leader Richard Saslaw, a Democrat, said most police forces won't change their policies in light of the opinion.\u00a0 \"Is it going to affect a single thing? The answer is no,\" he said. \"A majority of the police forces won't bother with it.\"\u00a0 Saslaw noted that per Cuccinelli's opinion, state officers are still advised against arresting anyone for a civil immigration offense. Saslaw said he doesn't see Virginia, a non-border state, becoming a focal point of the immigration debate any time soon, and he rejected the idea that McDonnell could issue an order codifying Cuccinelli's ruling.\u00a0 \"We don't have a dictatorship in Virginia,\" Saslaw said. \"It would carry absolutely not a shred of legal validity.\"\u00a0 McDonnell spokeswoman Stacey Johnson said Marshall was not specifically calling for an executive order. The actual letter to the governor asked McDonnell to \"direct all appropriate law enforcement officers of the commonwealth to implement the policies referenced\" in the Cuccinelli decision.\u00a0 Regardless of how Cuccinelli's ruling is interpreted, a few Virginia lawmakers are pushing hard to keep their state in the middle of the immigration furor. Though it's not anywhere close to a border state, Virginia's illegal immigrant population, concentrated mostly in the north, has been pegged at about 300,000 by the Pew Hispanic Center. Any crime connected to that community has the potential to feed the debate.\u00a0 Just as the killing of rancher Robert Krentz by a suspected illegal immigrant fueled the push for border security in Arizona, a recent killing in Virginia has stirred emotions over the issue. An illegal immigrant on Sunday was involved in a crash that killed one nun and injured two others -- he reportedly had a prior drunk-driving record and was going through deportation proceedings.\u00a0 The crash happened in   County, which is ground zero for immigration controversy in Virginia. Board of County Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart seized on the incident, as he continued to push a proposed immigration law similar to Arizona's.\u00a0 Stewart said in an e-mail to FoxNews.com that Virginia will \"adjust our course\" in light of the Arizona case and said he hopes the federal government decides to sue his state too.\u00a0 \"Virginia has shown in the past that people care about this issue even 2,500 miles away from the most porous parts of our southern border. Especially in Prince William County, we are very close to the nation's Capitol.  ,   and   can't ignore what is happening in their own backyard,\" he wrote.\u00a0 Prince William County, which Marshall represents, has a local law that requires police to ask about the immigration status of anyone they arrest. Stewart said Cuccinelli's ruling doesn't dramatically change anything there but that \"it is good have the Virginia AG on board.\"\u00a0 Stewart is pushing for a statewide policy to require police to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest. He claims the proposal anticipates the legal pitfalls that trapped Arizona. He has launched a political action committee to raise money for a public campaign in support of the bill, and he has a started a website,   where he is trying to collect 100,000 signatures.\u00a0 Saslaw ridiculed the push.\u00a0 \"The bill ain't gonna make it through the General Assembly,\" he said. \"It won't even get to a law.\"","articles_date":"03 08 2010","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2010\/08\/03\/virginia-arizona-state-lawmakers-fuel-immigration-debate.html","articles_title":"Is Virginia the Next Arizona?

The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.\" The statement made no mention of returning contributions from Weinstein. On Tuesday morning, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic party's 2016 vice presidential nominee, sat down for an interview on CNN's \"New Day.\" Asked about the allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein, the deposed Hollywood mogul,  Kaine said : \"Any leader should condemn this. These allegations are low-life behavior.\" By that definition, the last two Democratic presidents as well as the party's 2016 nominee are not leaders.   Five days after the New York Times broke the news that Weinstein, the head of Miramax and a major Democratic donor,  faced a series of allegations of inappropriate behavior toward women over a several-decade span , neither Bill or Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama has said a single word about the incidents.  What's remarkable about that silence is that Weinstein isn't, really, denying the allegations. In a long statement released in response to the Times story -- in which he quoted Jay Z and said he would take a leave of absence to focus on fighting the NRA --  Weinstein acknowledged : \"I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.\"  He's already been fired  -- two days ago -- by the board of  directors of The Weinstein Company \"in light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days.\" And,  lots of Democrats who Weinstein gave money to over the years have either returned those donations or given them to charity . All of which makes the silence from Obama and the Clintons all the more stark -- particularly because the trio's ties to Weinstein run deep. Not only was he a major bundler of campaign cash for Obama and Clinton but he's also hosted a series of fundraisers at his various homes around the country over the years. In 2013, he hosted then-President Barack Obama for a fundraiser at his New York City apartment. In 2012, Obama did a fundraiser for his re-election bid at Weinstein's home in Connecticut. During the 2016 campaign, Weinstein held a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign at his New York City apartment and another with fashion mogul Anna Wintour. In 2013,  first lady Michelle Obama praised Weinstein  for his involvement in a  student film symposium at the White House . \"I want to start by thanking Harvey Weinstein for organizing this amazing day,\" she said. \"Harvey. This is possible because of Harvey. He is a wonderful human being, a good friend and just a powerhouse.\" Malia Obama, the couple's daughter, interned at The Weinstein Company before starting college at Harvard this year. Despite repeated inquiries from reporters in search of comment about the allegations against Weinstein, the offices of the Clintons and Obamas have remained mum. At an  event at the University of California Davis promoting her book on Monday night , Clinton spoke for more than an hour but never mentioned Weinstein's name. Patti Solis Doyle, who was Clinton's campaign manager in 2007, praised her former boss's record, but said her silence so far has been disappointing. \"As long as I have known her she really has walked the walk and talked the talk on this,\" Solis Doyle told CNN's Poppy Harlow Tuesday. \"For me she gave me the ability to bring my little, you know, 3-month-old baby to work when I needed to and have a crib in my office, you know, I know her heart is in the right place. So personally it is, it is disappointing she hasn't come out and condemned Harvey Weinstein.\" What explains the notable silence from the Obamas and the Clintons?   Likely, friendship. As in, they are friends and, as such, want to give Weinstein every possible benefit of the doubt. So, rather than jump on Weinstein, they give him a few days of breathing room. It's also possible that Clinton and Obama believe that they are no longer active figures in day-to-day Democratic politics and, therefore, don't need to respond to every single news story out there. Both of these explanations fall short, however. On the friendship front, exercising situational ethics isn't ethics at all. If your best friend commits a series of indefensible acts, you don't get a pass from condemning that behavior because you have known each other for a long time. Friendship doesn't excuse behavior like Weinstein has been exhibiting for years.   And, there's no question about what's happening here! Weinstein hasn't denied it. And the allegations continue to pile up. The story isn't getting better for him with time. It's getting worse. When it comes to the Clintons and Obama as less-than-active participants in Democratic politics, that overlooks the fact that they remain the three most recognizable and beloved leaders within the Democratic Party.  It also conveniently leaves out  Clinton's much-repeated pledge during her recent book tour  that \"I am not done with politics because I literally believe that our country's future is at stake.\" My guess is that the growing public pressure on the Clintons and Obama to say something -- anything! -- about Weinstein will force them to speak (or release a statement) sometime in the next 48 hours. But, the question remains: What the heck is taking them so long?","articles_date":"10 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/10\/politics\/harvey-weinstein-obama-clinton\/index.html","articles_title":"It took Hillary Clinton five days to issue this statement about Harvey Weinstein","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":158,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) No one knows who will win the White House on Tuesday. But there's already one undisputed loser from the ferocious presidential campaign: James Comey. The FBI director  cleared Hillary Clinton for a second time  Sunday in the probe over her private email server. But the damage to her campaign -- and his own reputation -- is unlikely to quickly heal. With his highly public handling of the email probe and his resulting entanglement in the political tumult, Comey accomplished the unusual feat of antagonizing each side of the partisan divide. In the aftermath, his stature is diminished and his future in a Clinton or Donald Trump administration is highly uncertain. Comey's new status as one of Washington's most polarizing leaders is a stunning twist for someone who long enjoyed the genuine respect of both parties. If he hoped his Sunday letter to lawmakers informing them that a review of new emails potentially tied to Clinton's server would quell the political storm swirling around him, he was mistaken.  Democrats pilloried him for influencing the final days of an already vitriolic campaign and Republicans accused him of caving to political pressure and questioned how the bureau could review thousands of emails so quickly. \"Right now, (Clinton) is being protected by a rigged system,\"  Trump said at a rally  in Sterling Heights, Michigan.  \"It's a totally rigged system. You can't review 650,000 emails in eight days. You can't do it folks,\" Trump said, mischaracterizing the number of emails the FBI was reviewing. Sources with knowledge of the investigation have told CNN the number is in the tens of thousands. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said Comey \"unfairly hurt the campaign of one candidate and changed the tenor of this election.\" Can Comey continue? Comey is three years into a 10-year appointment at the FBI. But there are now serious questions about whether his position is still tenable going forward \u2014 regardless of who becomes president. By late Sunday, neither Clinton nor Trump supporters would definitively say their candidate still had confidence in Comey. \"It's not my place to come in and say if Director Comey is doing a good job or not a good job,\" Trump's senior communications adviser Jason Miller told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room.\" \"It is clear that the system is rigged. It is clear that this investigation has not been handled very well from the beginning.\" Trump's path to White House lined with false, misleading statements Asked on \"The Situation Room\" whether he had confidence in Comey, Rep. Sean Duffy, a Trump supporter, said \"I don't have any information from inside the FBI to make that conclusion right now.\" Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a Clinton supporter, also refused to say whether he had confidence in the FBI chief. \"Director Comey has a good reputation and he's been a law enforcement professional for many years,\" Butterfield said. Still, he expressed concern about the initial letter sent to Congress at the end of last month.  \"I am still evaluating why he would send such a letter to Congress,\" Butterfield said.  Comey recognizes he's in a tough spot even after the election. But an official said he's given no indication he will resign. FBI's reputation at stake The FBI chief's future isn't all that's at stake. The political storm surrounding Clinton's emails and the FBI's handling of them threaten to tarnish the bureau itself. Republicans are suspicious of the extent to which the FBI is being constrained by President Barack Obama's Justice Department. Democrats are worried that leaks and probes into the Clinton Foundation are indications that rank-and-file FBI agents are upset by Comey's decision not to seek indictments of Clinton. Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine made a stunning charge Saturday that elements of the FBI were trying to throw the election to Trump -- a contention that would seemingly make it difficult for Comey to work in a Clinton administration. \"Comey knew that the FBI is not only a leaky sieve but there were people within the FBI actively working\u2014actively working\u2014to try to help the Trump campaign,\" Kaine said in an interview with Fusion. \"This just absolutely staggering, and it is a massive blow to the integrity of the FBI.\" Emotions run high in final days of the campaign From the start, the FBI probe into Clinton and Comey's handling of it has drawn him onto political ground anyone in his position would prefer to avoid. And it's been a reminder that once officials like Comey, who by definition required to be nonpartisan, enter the political crossfire, it's nearly impossible to get out with their character and prestige in place. \"The destruction of James Comey by political pressure is painful to watch,\" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, tweeted on Sunday. \"He is being twisted into an indefensible pretzel of contradictions.\" If Clinton loses the election on Tuesday, Democrats are certain to blame Comey, since she saw her comfortable leads in opinion polls over Trump erode following his first letter to Congress just over a week ago. If she wins, but her margin is narrow, or if Democrats fail to win back the Senate, Comey will also be accused of actions that had the effect of suppressing the Democratic vote and influencing the election. \"This should never have happened,\" Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings said on \"The Situation Room,\" arguing that Comey should never have sent the initial letter to Congress in the first place. \"Unfortunately, Donald Trump and his associates have blown this thing up like Director Comey should have known.\" CNN's Pamela Brown and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report","articles_date":"7 11 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/11\/06\/politics\/fbi-james-comey-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\/index.html","articles_title":"James Comey: The man Democrats and Republicans hate","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":159,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Democratic West Virginia Sen.

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican challenging Manchin in the 2018 Senate race, issued a letter last week calling on Manchin to resign his position in Senate Democratic leadership, casting Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as far too liberal and at odds with the interests of West Virginia. Manchin was one of three Democrats not to sign onto a recent letter laying out Democratic priorities on the tax reform debate. He told the Gazette-Mail in a story published Sunday he supported his fellow Democrats in principle but wanted to keep leeway for Republican support. \"The bottom line is, if it doesn't help West Virginia, it doesn't make sense to me,\" Manchin said. \"And just because there's an election doesn't mean I sign on or don't sign on.\" When the paper went on to ask Manchin if his decision was about politics and the coming election, Manchin offered a forceful denial. \"Don't care if I get elected,\" Manchin said. \"Don't care if I get defeated.

Tim Kaine is demanding the Pentagon provide more details on the US military's role in Niger and explain how differentiates between \"advise and assist\" and combat missions. The 2016 Democratic vice-presidential nominee sent a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis on Monday asking for more information about US troops deployed to Niger and other countries where they are training foreign forces, following the October 4 incident in Niger in which four US service members were killed. The questions Kaine raised are already on the mind of military leaders as the Army is considering revamping how it trains foreign militaries. \"While I fully appreciate both the necessity and importance for our armed forces to assist in the professionalization and capacity building of local security forces around the globe, to include those in Niger, I am concerned that our complex operating environment has made it nearly impossible to differentiate between \"advise and assist\" and combat operations,\" Kaine wrote. Kaine's letter, obtained by CNN, is the latest instance where lawmakers are pressing the Pentagon to provide more details on the circumstances surrounding the October 4 Niger incident, in which four US service members were killed. Senate armed services chairman John McCain has accused the Pentagon of not being forthcoming with details surrounding the incident, and both his committee and the House armed services panel are  expected to receive briefings  on Niger on Thursday. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Joe Dunford  spoke to reporters  at the Pentagon Monday about the Pentagon's investigation into the ambush. The Niger incident is sparking new questions on Capitol Hill about the US military's role in Africa, and proponents of a new war authorization for ISIS are pointing to it as another sign that the current 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force is outdated. Kaine has been one of the most vocal advocates in Congress calling for a new war authorization. He argued in his letter that the blending of advise and assist missions with combat operations \"makes the line triggering the requirement for congressional authorization and approval blurry.\" \"Specifically, since 2013, the US military personnel presence in Niger has grown from approximately 100 personnel to over 800 today, making Niger host to one of the largest US troop presences in Africa and raising the question of 'mission creep,'\" Kaine wrote. The Army is already in the process of revamping how it trains foreign militaries, a skill seen as critical to achieving lasting success on the counterterrorism battlefields of Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.   While it's a critical component of US strategic objectives in the fight against terrorism, critics say the Army has historically not prioritized training and advisory missions. It's a failure and missing skill set that the Army's leadership acknowledged on the sidelines of the Association of the United States Army's annual meeting in Washington earlier this month. \"What we've done for 16 consecutive years is done that function on essentially an ad hoc basis,\" Gen. Mark Milley, the Army Chief of Staff, told reporters in a press conference at the meeting. To address the issue, the Army in May moved to establish the first of what it is calling \"Security Force Assistance Brigades\" specifically designed to more effectively train foreign militaries battling terrorist groups.  \"One of the initiatives that we the Army are doing to increase our capability to conduct train, advise and assist, enable and accompany missions around the world is the establishment of Security Force Assistance Brigades,\" Milley said.  \"One of the reason past efforts have failed they were temporary in nature,\" Milley explained, noting that training teams were created ad hoc by pulling officers from regular brigade combat teams which he said undermined the latter's readiness.  The Army plans to create six new Security Force Assistance Brigades, five for the regular army and one in the National Guard, with each brigade consisting of about 500 soldiers.  \"We are likely to be involved in train, advise, assist operations around the world for many years to come,\" Milley said, adding \"so we think it's about time we recognize that fact with force structure.\" The US Army Special Forces, commonly known as the \"Green Berets,\" were created during the early days of the Cold War, with one of their key missions being the training the military and police forces of America's Cold War allies to battle enemy insurgencies. And while US Special Operations Forces from across the military services in recent years have worked closely with local partners, helping the Afghan Commandos and the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service become two of the most effective battlefield American allies, training efforts for less elite partner troops were considered less effective and local conventional forces have been seen as less capable. Effective training could also relieve some of the strain being placed on US special operations forces who have become increasingly central to a variety of US military missions across the globe. The \"mission frankly is bigger than Special Forces has ever been designed or capable to handle,\" Milley said of the train and advisory mission.","articles_date":"24 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/24\/politics\/kaine-senate-more-details-us-role-niger\/index.html","articles_title":"Kaine demands more details on US role in Niger","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":162,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine made his case to Latino voters Thursday, asking them to vote for his presidential ticket with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton -- in Spanish. While speaking at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, Kaine said Republican nominee Donald Trump is \"someone who thinks 'Latino outreach' means tweeting out a picture of a taco bowl.\" Kaine slammed the real estate mogul for saying Mexicans are criminals and rapists, calling Alicia Machado \"Miss Housekeeping\" when she won the 1996 Miss Universe pageant and for suggesting Indiana-born US District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel was biased in overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University because he is \"Mexican.\" Democrats hope jobs report will make voters say 'Thanks Obama' -- and vote Hillary \"In the first weeks of his campaign, Donald Trump said that immigrants from Mexico are drug dealers, rapists, murderers,\" Kaine said in Spanish. \"In the last debate, Trump referred to them as 'bad hombres.' ... He insists that 'This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.' He doesn't understand that multilingual and bilingual families contribute to the diversity that makes our nation strong.\" Kaine's speech is in part a sign of Clinton's campaign efforts to turn traditionally red Arizona in her electoral favor. According to a  CNN\/ORC poll  released Wednesday, Trump tops Clinton by 5 percentage points with voters in Arizona, 49% to 44% respectively. But the campaign is targeting Latino and millennial voters -- where 30.7% of the Arizona population identified as Latino and\/or Hispanic.  Kaine, who grew up in the Kansas City area, became fluent in Spanish during volunteer service in Honduras during the early 1980s. The former Virginia governor -- whose state includes a growing Latino population -- in 2013 became the first senator to deliver a floor speech entirely in Spanish. On Thursday the Virginia senator was introduced by Clarissa Felix, a student at Arizona State University, who said her mother recently became a US citizen, and they both plan to vote for Clinton and Kaine in the election. Team Clinton to outspend Team Trump by $20 million in final week Kaine also slammed local Arizona politicians -- former Gov. Jan Brewer and Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- who are both supporters of Trump for president. \"One of Trump's biggest supporters, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who's facing criminal charges for profiling Latinos and has persecuted undocumented immigrants. He says he thinks Trump will get 'a lot of Hispanic votes,'\" Kaine said in Spanish. \"Just the other day, your former governor, Jan Brewer, who signed into law the discriminatory SB1070 that promoted racial profiling, said that she wasn't worried about her candidate, Donald Trump, winning this state, because, as she said, Latinos 'don't get out and vote.'\" He continued in Spanish, \"So I hate to break it to the Trump campaign, but Latinos are going to have a really big voice in this election ...  and the choice is really clear.\" He ended his speech by pleading that Latinos vote because they could help swing the state blue for Clinton. \"For the first time in a while, the state of Arizona is competitive -- and every single vote counts,\" he said.

Tim Kaine said Tuesday that leaders should \"condemn\" the alleged behavior by Harvey Weinstein -- even as his former running mate Hillary Clinton has remained silent on the issue. Hours later, Clinton's former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, said it was \"disappointing\" that Clinton hadn't yet condemned Weinstein's purported behavior.  \"Any leader should condemn this,\" Kaine told CNN's Alisyn Camerota in an interview on \"New Day,\" referring to the bombshell allegations of sexual harassment by the disgraced Hollywood executive. \"These allegations are low-life behavior.\" The Virginia Democrat ran alongside Clinton on the Democratic presidential ticket during the 2016 election. Weinstein was a frequent Democratic donor who gave thousands of dollars to their campaign for the White House. While many Democrats have sent Weinstein's donations to charity, several prominent Democrats -- including former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as Hillary Clinton -- have not publicly addressed the accusations. Camerota noted that Weinstein donated more than $30,000 to the Clinton campaign. She pressed him on whether the money should be returned. \"Well, the campaign is over,\" Kaine replied. \"Here's what's happening: You've got to call out bad behavior,\" he continued. \"Anybody who sexually harasses somebody or anybody who uses their position of power, especially to coerce or intimidate anybody, that's low-life behavior and that's unacceptable ... I think a number of folks he has given to in this campaign cycle are returning those funds.\" He added, \"I haven't asked him for anything and he hasn't given me anything.\" When asked why Clinton has remained silent about Weinstein, Kaine responded he's \"nobody's press secretary.\" \"I'm a US senator, and I'm telling you that sexual harassment is unacceptable,\" he said. \"Hillary Clinton speaks out against sexual harassment often and I'm sure she'll have a word to say when the time is right for her.\" The  recent report in The New York Times  cataloged accusations of sexual harassment against the filmmaker that spanned three decades. Three days after the report, Weinstein was fired by the company he co-founded. Longtime Clinton aides have been confused by the former secretary of state's silence on the issue, questioning -- in private -- why she has not weighed in at all. \"Personally it is, it is disappointing she hasn't come out and condemned Harvey Weinstein,\" Solis Doyle told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview on \"CNN Newsroom\" Tuesday morning.  Weinstein has long been a Clinton donor with ties to the political family. Weinstein was one of many from Hollywood who donated to Bill Clinton's legal defense fund in the 1990s, a Washington Post report from the time stated. More recently, the Clintons rented a home next to Weinstein in the Hamptons in 2015, and Weinstein served as a connector between Hollywood stars and Clinton's 2016 campaign.

In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday, Kaine said the two wouldn't reject the possibility of a future Asia-Pacific trade agreement.  \"You never close the door if you can get a deal that's going to be good for American workers and our economy,\" the Virginia senator said. \"We aren't against trade.\" \"We want to find export markets for American businesses because they'll be able to add workers the more they export,\" he said. \"That's very important.

Tim Kaine requested records Tuesday from the Office of Compliance that detail the scope of sexual harassment claims filed against members of Congress, as well as congressional staffers. In a letter to the head of the Office of Compliance, the office that handles harassment complaints and administers payments, Kaine asked for the number of harassment claims filed in the last decade; the number of claims against members of the Senate and their staffs that ended in \"some form of resolution\"; and the amount of each settlement paid with taxpayer funds. In the letter to Susan Tsui Grundmann, the office's executive director, Kaine he plans to publicly disclose the information if the committee provides it. \"In the interest of transparency, I plan to publicly disclose this information because I believe it will provide some insight into the scope of the problem and help determine solutions for preventing and addressing future incidents, Kaine said. No such breakdown of sexual harassment claims has been previously released by the Office of Compliance. At the request of the House Committee on Administration last week,  the OOC released data showing  that it had paid six settlements since 2013. The Office of Compliance said just one of those settlements -- for $84,000 --- was for a sexual harassment claim. The top members on the Senate Ethics Committee, Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, wrote to the Office of Compliance last week seeking information on all claims of sexual harassment, discrimination, retaliation and other prohibited workplace practices involving members of the Senate. The chair and ranking member of the House ethics panel have made a similar request of the OOC. The push for additional data comes as congressional leaders are under pressure  to reform the secretive system through which harassment claims are handled  on Capitol Hill.

The author works for David Axelrod. Cary, North Carolina (CNN) If Hillary Clinton is elected president, she will quickly ask Congress to revise and update America's current Authorization for Use of Military Force in the fight against ISIS, says her nominee for vice president, Sen. Tim Kaine. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, the Virginia Democrat has argued that the Obama administration must seek an updated approval from Congress to fight the war against ISIS. The administration maintains that it already has approval through the current force authorization, passed in the wake of the 9\/11 attacks. \"Hillary has said that that's something she wants to do very early in her administration,\" Kaine told David Axelrod on \"The Axe Files\" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. Obama has sought congressional authorization for use of force in Iraq and Syria including  in February 2015 , though the Congress didn't do anything with his request.  Kaine said the military currently is operating in Iraq and Syria under an inadequate, \"60-word authorization that was passed on Sept. 14, 2001, when about 70% of the current Congress wasn't there when that vote was cast.\"  Our adversaries and the battlefields on which we fight have evolved so much, Kaine said, \"It's time for Congress to get back in the game and refine and revise that authorization, and really look at what it is to be engaged in military action against non-state terrorist groups.\" Kaine touched on a number of issues during the conversation, which took place in the battleground state of North Carolina, where he had been on a two-day campaign swing. Accusing Donald Trump of embracing an \"authoritarian view,\" Kaine said the Republican nominee's repeated suggestions that the electoral process is \"rigged\" is a dangerous signal to his supporters. \"I lived in Honduras. It was a military dictatorship,\" Kaine said. \"I came to understand things I took for granted about our system, and I don't think you should be trying to tear down a central pillar of our system in the way he's trying to do.\"  Kaine also said that he believed that some of the vehement opposition President Barack Obama has encountered in office is rooted in race. \"I think there's been a level of disrespect shown him that I find saddening,\" Kaine stated, while maintaining it does not surprise him. \"I see the world through the perspective of a guy who's been a civil rights lawyer in the South,\" he continued. \"I haven't been surprised at it.\"  But regardless of what has motivated some of the opposition, Kaine believes Obama's presidency has been a net-positive for racial progress in America. \"The very night he was elected, he created a class of successors who'd never been able to see themselves as President of the United States who now could,\" Kaine said.

But, we're now beyond obstruction of justice in terms of what's being investigated,\" the Virginia Democrat told CNN Tuesday. \"This is moving into perjury, false statements and even potentially treason.\" Kaine's comments follow a series of New York Times reports including one story Monday on an email sent to Trump Jr. last year stating that a Russian lawyer had \"compromising\" information about Hillary Clinton as \"part of a Russian government effort\" to help the Trump campaign. President Donald Trump's oldest son tweeted Tuesday screenshots of an email exchange that he says are the emails setting up the meeting with the lawyer. That tweet came after Kaine's comment.  A Kaine spokesperson later sent a statement to CNN saying that the matter of treason will be up to investigators to prove. \"Senator Kaine stressed that nothing is proven yet,\" the Kaine spokesperson said. \"But he acknowledged the grave impropriety, if proven, of any effort to cooperate with a foreign nation -- especially one deemed by our military leaders to be a primary state adversary -- to influence an American election.\" Sen. John Cornyn, a high-ranking Texas Republican on the committee, said of Trump Jr.'s comments, \"I don't think we have enough information to reach a conclusion but he certainly made himself a witness.\" Members of the Senate intelligence committee, which is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, said Monday they plan to invite Trump Jr. to testify. He tweeted that he would gladly speak with investigators. Committee chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina would not comment on Trump Jr.'s tweet, besides telling reporters that he wanted to fully vet the meeting with the Russian lawyer and that his committee is \"very early in the investigation.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said any time you're in a campaign and you get an offer from a foreign government the answer is \"no.\"  Some Republicans -- including Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley -- defended Trump Jr.'s tweet as an example of transparency. \"I think the transparency is the proper thing to do and I think he's shown that he wants everybody to know what the situation is, as I have found them on so many stories since the election,\" Grassley told CNN.

The Koch network announced Saturday that they plan between $300 and $400 million on their political and policy objectives during the 2018 political cycle as Democrats wage an intense battle to win control of the House. The network has made the repeal of Obamacare a central focus of their political and policy work. They believe that neither the House, nor the Senate version achieve that goal.  \"This Senate bill needs to get better. It has to get better,\" said Tim Phillips, a top lieutenant in the network who recently met with White House officials to outline their proposed changes to the health care system.  The proposed changes to Medicaid, Phillips said, were unacceptable, because they just amount to tinkering around the edges rather than reforming the program. The Senate bill would dramatically scale back federal support of Medicaid and phase out the money that the government has provided to expand eligibility for Medicaid in the states.   Several GOP senators have announced  their opposition  to the Senate bill in its current form. Among them are conservative senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz, who believe the bill does not go far enough and are attending the Koch network donor retreat this weekend. For several other senators, like Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, the cuts to Medicaid go too far. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only lose two members in order to win passage for the bill. 'The bill is not going to fix healthcare' The Koch network has strongly opposed the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare -- arguing that by adding people to the rolls, the quality of care for the most vulnerable Medicaid recipients has plummeted.   \"It was a struggling -- frankly failing -- program before this dramatic expansion,\" said Phillips, President of Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network's political organizing arm.  \"To simply say we're going to do a slight nip and tuck to a program that -- because of Obamacare -- has added millions and millions of people is frankly immoral. It's not right to do that.\" \"At the end of the day, this bill is not going to fix healthcare,\" said James Davis, a spokesman for the network during an afternoon session with reporters. \"We are going to be focusing our efforts out into the future on how we can fix it.\"   Phillips, a top lieutenant with the network, noted that the organization was louder in their opposition to House version earlier this year, because they wanted to remind White House and Congressional officials that repealing Obamacare \"was a promise that had been made to repeal Obamacare during four consecutive national elections beginning in 2010, and that the vast majority of members had pledged that.\"  Activists with the network have been more engaged in negotiations on the Senate bill, which is one reason they are in a wait-and-see mode.  'We are more optimistic' Charles Koch, who was a vociferous critic of Donald Trump during the 2012 presidential campaign, did not mention the bill or the President as he welcomed hundreds of donors to the historic Broadmoor Hotel at the foot of Cheyenne Mountain Saturday evening. (Koch met with Vice President Mike Pence on Friday).  Instead he praised the depth and breadth of his organization, which will hold a series of seminars this weekend focused on their legislative priorities, including criminal justice reform, education, tax reform and poverty.   \"We are more optimistic now about what we can accomplish than we have ever been,\" he said in remarks to donors, noting the group's work propelling the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.  Earlier Saturday, the network announced a new partnership with football star Deion Sanders. The Koch network pledged to spend $21 million on the joint initiative with Sanders to reduce persistent poverty in Dallas.  Six senators are taking part in the seminars this weekend: Senators John Cornyn, Cory Gardner, Jeff Flake, Ben Sasse, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee; along with four Governors: Greg Abbott of Texas, Matt Bevin of Kentucky, Eric Greitens of Missouri, and Doug Ducey of Arizona.","articles_date":"25 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/25\/politics\/koch-brothers-senate-healthcare-bill\/index.html","articles_title":"Koch brothers' political network critical of Senate healthcare bill","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":174,"issue":2,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Arnold Rampersad is the Sara Hart Kimball Professor in the Humanities, Emeritus at Stanford University. His books include \"Ralph Ellison,\" the two-volume work \"The Life of Langston Hughes\" and \"Jackie Robinson: A Biography.\" The views expressed here are his.  (CNN) Tim Kaine adorned with two literary references his  introduction to Hillary Clinton when she gave her historic concession speech  before an audience of their bitterly disappointed supporters.  One was to a poem by Langston Hughes, the other to a fragment of fiction by William Faulkner.  Both writers served the bittersweet moment well, if in different ways. I say \"bitter,\" because fresh blood was still flowing from the wounds inflicted by Donald Trump's army; I say \"sweet,\" because the quality of Kaine's and Clinton's speeches as they faced defeat reminded some of us of the resilience of the human spirit. In his remarks, Kaine recited one of  Hughes' youthful poems, \"Dreams\":   Hold fast to dreams For if dreams die Life is a broken-winged bird That cannot fly.   Hold fast to dreams For when dreams go Life is a barren field Frozen with snow. Since Hughes' poem makes no allusion to politics or racism, we can take it at face value as a lyric meditation on our need to resist despair when facing life's vicissitudes -- those troubles from which no one, no matter how privileged, is exempt.   The poem speaks to the essence of living. Nevertheless, it is difficult to know that a young black man composed it during some of the worst years of Jim Crow in America and not see it at once as a political rallying cry despite its sentimentality.  But the dream was a marinating, evolving motif in Hughes' work. It would achieve its most mature form probably in the popular \"Harlem.\" That work begins with the question \"What happens to a dream deferred?\" and ends with the threat \"Or does it explode?\" The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. would pick up on Hughes' dream imagery in his most celebrated oration, which we remember for its recurrent assertion \"I Have a Dream.\" That speech underscored his hopes for an America that would conquer social injustice ingrained into our daily life as a consequence of slavery. One is reminded also of Hughes' militant anthem of the Great Depression, \"Let America Be America Again,\" which appeared in 1936: (America \"never was America to me,\" and yet America \"must be.\") Introducing Clinton, Kaine paired the sentimentality of Hughes with something much more muscular, and even menacing. With his invocation of Wash Jones' defiant line -- \"They kilt us but they ain't whupped us yit\" -- from Faulkner's 1936 novel, \"Absalom, Absalom!\" -- one is tempted to say that Kaine in a sense brought a bayonet to what had been a war of words. It's a strange turnaround, and an odd application of the deeper lessons of the Civil War, but one that makes sense. Kaine is from Virginia, where they live and breathe this sense of American history and its symbolism.  The grand fight now is for the future of America. Kaine was reminding his and Clinton's people that their election loss was only one setback, like Bull Run, when the South routed Union forces and terrified many people in the North, but it is not the end of the war.   The courage of the rebel South in the Civil War is distinct from the pro-slavery goals of that same rebel South. In a paradoxical reprising of what took place in America in the 1860s, the remarkable courage of the rebel South is there to be invoked and emulated in what his and Clinton's supporters must often see as a primal battle, a new civil war, for the soul and state of America.

Lawmakers on both side of the aisle grilled Mr. Zuckerberg over his company\u2019s handling of user data and were particularly focused on the platform\u2019s privacy settings, which put the onus on users to protect their privacy. \u2022 Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would agree or refuse to change Facebook\u2019s default settings to minimize collection and use of users\u2019 data. \u2022 While Tuesday\u2019s Senate hearing contained tough questions, the lawmakers were generally deferential to Mr. Zuckerberg. That is less the case in the House, where lawmakers have repeatedly pointed their fingers at Mr. Zuckerberg and expressed their \u201cdisappointment\u201d with his answers. \u2022 Mr. Zuckerberg, wearing a blue suit and tie, has remained calm and respectful in answering the questions. However, he has more frequently told lawmakers he is unsure what their question means when being asked to give direct answer. \u2022 Mr. Zuckerberg was accompanied by Facebook\u2019s top legal and policy staff. Facebook\u2019s general counsel, Colin Stretch, and Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy, resumed their seats behind Mr. Zuckerberg. Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, kicked off the hearing by declaring that \u201cwhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured.\u201d Mr. Walden floated the prospect of regulation, saying that \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201d Later in the hearing, Mr. Zuckerberg said regulation was \u201cinevitable.\u201d But he repeated that the right kind of regulation mattered and he pointed out that some regulation could only solidify the power of a large company like Facebook, which could hurt start-ups. On Tuesday, several senators sounded a similar tune, saying Facebook couldn\u2019t be trusted with the vast amounts of data being collected, much of which was being done without users\u2019 full understanding. \u201cMost Americans have no idea what they are signing up for because Facebook\u2019s terms of service are beyond comprehension,\u201d Mr. Graham said in a statement after the hearing. He called Facebook a \u201cvirtual monopoly\u201d and said \u201ccontinued self-regulation is not the right answer when it comes to dealing with the abuses we have seen on Facebook.\u201d Three senators introduced privacy legislation on Tuesday that would require users\u2019 permission to collect and share their data. Mr. Zuckerberg repeatedly said he was open to regulations but that it would have to be the \u201cright\u201d regulations with the right details. On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg was asked to agree to privacy legislation that requires permission for data collection. Mr. Zuckerberg demurred and did not express support for any specific legislative proposal. Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg made a promise. He said that Facebook planned to give users worldwide the same privacy controls required by a tough  new data protection law  which will go into effect in the European Union next month. This morning, Rep. Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed him repeatedly on the issue. And Mr. Zuckerberg repeated his commitment to give all users those controls. But European regulators and privacy advocates said over the last week that a number of Facebook\u2019s current practices seemed violate the new law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. For one thing, the European law requires privacy by design and default. European experts said that, in their view, that would require Facebook turn off a number of advertising and privacy settings which are currently set to sharing and instead ask user permission to turn them on. Mr. Zuckerberg answered the legislators\u2019 questions by saying that the company plans to put a tool \u201cat the top of everyone\u2019s app\u201d where users will be able to make privacy and sharing choices. But the company may not offer affirmative consent \u2014 asking users to explicitly opt-in \u2014 in every country, depending on legal issues, he said. Mr. Green also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if Facebook planned to comply with the provision in the European law that allows individuals to obtain a copy of the data companies hold about them. That data would include both the messages, posts and photos that an individual posted as well as details a company may have collected about them, European regulators said. Facebook currently allows users to download a copy of their personal data like their messages, likes and posts. But Rep. Green wanted to know if Facebook would comply with the European law \u2014 and extend those protections to users worldwide \u2014 by providing individuals with the complete records and profiles the Facebook has compiled on them. That would include any data the company collected about its users by tracking them on other websites, and any data the company bought or acquired from third parties about users, and any categorizations or algorithmic scores Facebook created about users, regulators said. Mr. Zuckerberg said he believed all of the data is available. That isn\u2019t true for the moment \u2014 at least for a couple of reporters who recently downloaded their Facebook data. But Facebook has about six weeks to figure out how to give users a copy of their algorithmic scores, Web tracking data and other records the social network has compiled before the law goes into effect in Europe. Lawmakers pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook didn\u2019t inform users about the  harvesting of user data by Cambridge Analytica , a political consulting firm with ties to the Trump campaign, in 2015, when it was informed of the data abuse. Mr. Zuckerberg on Tuesday did not admit that the company explicitly decided to withhold that information from consumers, but he said the company made a mistake in not telling users. Mr. Pallone, the New Jersey Democrat, chided Mr. Zuckerberg for his company\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 in not realizing how Facebook data could be utilized. \u201cFor all the good it brings, Facebook can be a weapon for those, like Russia and Cambridge Analytica, that seek to harm us and hack our democracy,\u201d he said. Several lawmakers have pointed out to Mr. Zuckerberg, repeatedly, that the Obama campaign used a Facebook app to also scrape data from users and their friends in 2012. But those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign\u2019s app and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for. The app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate. Asked whether Facebook will sue the researcher who created the app,  Aleksandr Kogan, or Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Zuckerberg said \u201cit\u2019s something we\u2019re looking into.\u201d Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, zeroed in on a line of questioning that his Texas counterpart in the Senate, Ted Cruz, also asked, pressing Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk. Mr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is \u201ca neutral public platform,\u201d a question also asked by Mr. Cruz. \u201cI do agree that we should give people a voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. Republican lawmakers returned several times to the issue of bias on Facebook. Steve Scalise of Louisiana questioned whether Facebook\u2019s newsfeed algorithms tamp down conservative news in favor of more left-leaning outlets, to which Mr. Zuckerberg responded that \u201cthere is absolutely no directive\u201d to have \u201cany kind of bias in anything we do.\u201d After Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington asked about a recent ad from a Catholic university featuring an image of Jesus on a cross, which Facebook briefly rejected before approving, Mr. Zuckerberg cautioned against overgeneralization. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t extrapolate from a few examples that the overall system is biased,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg responded. When he offered to explain changes made to Facebook\u2019s algorithms, Ms. McMoriss Rodgers opted to move on to her next question. The proliferation of so-called fake news has put Mr. Zuckerberg in an awkward spot, as the company promises to do a better job of weeding out propaganda and falsehoods but insists it cannot police free speech. At Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, grilled Mr. Zuckerberg on allegations that Facebook had censored content from Trump supporters and conservatives. And Democrats expressed concerns about the inflammatory stories that were published on the platform by the Internet Research Agency, a private company with Kremlin ties. Finger-pointing, accusations of filibustering, interrupting the witness and weariness over past apologies: Mr. Zuckerberg is facing a more hostile crowd in his second day of hearings. The feeling is bipartisan. \u201cI can\u2019t let you filibuster,\u201d Marsha Blackburn, a Republican of Tennessee, said interrupting Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s answer to her question about where privacy ranks in priorities at Facebook. Janice Schakowsky, a Democrat of Illinois, used a sizable chunk of her limited speaking time to read out a list of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s past apologies. The combative questioning is different from the Senate, where lawmakers pressed Mr. Zuckerberg but generally refrained from trying to embarrass or accuse him of evading their answers. Representative John Sarbanes of Maryland cut off Mr. Zuckerberg several times as he tried to answer a question about Facebook employees who  sit with political campaigns as \u201cembeds\u201d  and try to sell them advertising. Mr. Walden foreshadowed a line of questioning for Mr. Zuckerberg on how Facebook works and if the social media site has become a publisher or utility service that deserves regulation. \u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d Mr. Walden asked, listing industries like advertising, publishing and even telecom, or \u201ccommon carrier in the information age.\u201d The definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency. \u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201d Facebook, he said, is not a software company, despite creating software. It is not an aerospace company,  even though it builds planes . It is not a financial institution, although it offers payment tools for users. \u201cDo we have a responsibility for the content people share on Facebook? I think the answer to that question is yes,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. The Senate hearing made clear that lawmakers aren\u2019t quite sure what Facebook\u2019s business model is or how it works, including what the difference is between selling user data to advertisers and allowing advertisers to target ads to an aggregated slice of Facebook users. The technological gap between Silicon Valley and Washington was apparent when Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican of Mississippi, asked about internet regulation. Mr. Zuckerberg explained that when thinking about regulations, government officials need to differentiate between internet companies like his and broadband providers, the companies that build and run the \u201cpipes\u201d that carry internet traffic, like AT&T and Comcast. The difference is at the heart of net neutrality, a hotly debated regulation that was overturned last year. The rules prevent internet service providers from favoring the flow of all internet content through their pipes. \u201cI think in general the expectations that people have of the pipes are somewhat different from the platforms,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWhen you say pipes, you mean?\u201d Mr. Wicker asked.","articles_date":"11 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/11\/us\/politics\/zuckerberg-facebook-cambridge-analytica.html","articles_title":"Lawmakers Grill Mark Zuckerberg Over Facebook: Live Coverage","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":176,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Michael Bennet is a Democratic US senator from Colorado and Tim Kaine is a Democratic US senator from Virginia. The opinions expressed are their own.  (CNN) Many Americans struggle to manage the demands of work, family, and wellbeing in their busy lives. They expect us, as US senators, to carry their voices to Washington and craft legislation that is responsive to their concerns. Health care is one of the most urgent issues for American families. It is about ensuring a sick child or elderly parent has the treatment they need. It should have nothing to do with partisan politics. But this year too many Americans have been inundated with headlines about plans to take away their health care, including this week's news that Republicans want to  repeal the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate  as part of their tax bill. This would lead to an estimated 13 million people losing insurance.  Americans want both parties to work together on real solutions that lower costs and increase choice without exploding our debt or upending lives. Last month, we announced legislation that would accomplish this. We call our plan Medicare-X. For nearly a decade, Washington's partisan bickering over the Affordable Care Act has prevented productive discussion about how to improve the law. The ACA has many strengths: it expanded health coverage for over  20 million Americans , it protects Americans with preexisting conditions, and it draws on ideas from across the political spectrum like expanding Medicaid and enabling young adults under 26 to stay on their parents' health insurance plans.  But the law is imperfect. It does not go far enough to reduce costs and increase competition. And the dedicated efforts by President Trump to undermine the law have  exacerbated these challenges . By ending cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments and refusing to enforce the individual mandate, President Trump has put insurers in the impossible place of predicting what he will do next, causing them to raise rates and withdraw from markets.  This is especially true in  rural America  where the private insurance market often fails to deliver quality choices. In 2018,  over 1,500 counties  -- many of them in rural America -- will have just one option on the individual insurance market. And where competition is low, insurance companies often spike prices and offer plans with deductibles so high they are of little use. We owe these communities more choice and competition. One solution is a public option, which would give Americans the choice to buy into a program run like Medicare. In the past, this idea enjoyed support from both parties. When Republicans passed Medicare Part D in 2003, they included a public option as a fallback for areas with little competition on the private market. Similarly,  Medicare-X revives a public option  in our current health care debate. It would use the Medicare provider network, reimbursement schedule, and low administrative cost to deliver a high-quality product at a reasonable price that could be purchased on the individual insurance exchange. Starting in 2020, Medicare-X would become available to every individual in areas with one or fewer private plans on the individual market. By 2023, it would extend to every ZIP code in America. By 2024, Medicare-X would be available for purchase by small businesses.  Medicare-X would cover essential health benefits, including maternity care, pediatric services, preventive health, and emergency room visits. Americans could go online and compare Medicare-X with existing private plans to decide what's best for their families.   Medicare-X  would not increase taxes, increase the deficit or touch the Medicare trust fund. Because Medicare does not need to make a profit, pay taxes, or pay fancy salaries for corporate executives, the plan would be affordable. And those who currently qualify for a subsidy under the ACA could use it to bring their premiums down even further. Our proposal would not fix every problem in our health care system. But it is a giant step forward: more choice, lower costs, no increase in taxes or the deficit. Medicare-X should appeal to both parties because it offers a real solution for Americans struggling with our current health care system.","articles_date":"20 11 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/11\/19\/opinions\/medicare-x-opinion-bennet-kaine\/index.html","articles_title":"Make Obamacare better with Medicare-X","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":177,"issue":2,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Huntington, West Virginia (CNN) It was as if a light bulb went off over Sen. Joe Manchin's head. \"Get Monte from 'Say Yes to the Dress.' You know Monte -- what's his last name?\" the Democratic senator spun around smiling, looking at everyone nearby. \"He's a West Virginia boy!\" Manchin was touring a job fair hosted by his office last week and had just met the director of West Virginia's affiliate for Dress for Success, an organization that helps provide professional clothes for women. As he'd been doing with others at the fair, the Democratic senator tried to think of someone who could help publicize their cause. \"He's on 'Say Yes to the Dress,'\" Manchin repeated, still searching for the last name of the celebrity bridal consultant from the TLC reality show. Minutes later, a staffer looking at a phone answered him. \"Durham,\" she said. \"Monte's last name is Durham.\" It was the 17th job fair Manchin's office had hosted, this time in Huntington, West Virginia, a city with nearly 50,000 people on the western edge of the state. A steady stream of hundreds flowed in and out of a small arena for more than three hours to circulate among the 160 vendors. When Manchin, who's known for his retail politicking skills, showed up, he could barely make his way through the lobby. He wasn't swarmed like a celebrity; rather, there was an air of familiarity.  People walked up to him to take selfies or say he was doing a good job. Others approached him with personal requests, asking for help in Washington or support for local projects. Some politely shook his hand but showed no interest in talking to him. On Manchin's part, there was a lot of affection: squeezing of elderly women's hands, shoulder slapping with men and hearty handshakes and hugs. He constantly tried to come up with ideas to help the people he encountered, from recovering drug addicts to veterans. Manchin was already a well-known figure in West Virginia and on the national stage, but he has seen renewed attention under the first 100 days of President Donald Trump's administration. That's because his status as one of the few Democrats up for re-election in a state that overwhelmingly voted for Trump has thrust him into a delicate position, where he can be both courted and criticized by both sides of the aisle. But make no mistake: Manchin is no shoe-in for his re-election next year. Though the senator -- who's had a long career in public service -- has high name recognition in the state and a brand as a centrist Democrat, he's still campaigning among an electorate that picked Trump over Hillary Clinton by a whopping 42 points. At the fair, a Cowboy-hat wearing Democrat named Charles Masters approached him with a photo of a younger Manchin standing next to a younger Bill Clinton, the last Democratic presidential candidate to win the Mountain State back in 1996. \"He is standing beside the greatest politician that ever lived,\" Masters later told CNN, talking about the photo and praising Clinton's ability to work with Republicans. It was a stark illustration of the complex situation Manchin now finds himself in. He's a Democrat who started his political career in a state that was once very comfortable with Democrats but now rejects some of the progressive trajectory the party has taken.   In fact,  Democrats in West Virginia outnumbered Republicans in last year's election -- 44% to 31%  -- but the state still yielded Trump one of his greatest victory margins over Clinton. Manchin said people have pitched him the idea of abandoning his identity as a Democrat and adopting a different political affiliation. But he said he's \"just not going to do it.\" \"People pretty much know my brand. They know who I am,\" he told CNN in an interview, while munching on a chicken salad sandwich after the fair. \"If I was a constituent and I looked at me and I said 'Joe Manchin, he's changed to a Republican or changed to an independent. What was his purpose -- strictly to get re-elected? To help him politically? Or did he change his brand, too? Is he going to be somebody different now? Maybe he's not going to be the old Joe I've known for 30 years.' So I said, listen, I am who I am. Being a 'D' or an 'R' or not does not change anything.\" Aiming to be the 'honest broker' Instead, Manchin is building a case that he's a Democrat with Trump's ear and can be what he calls an \"honest broker\" between the White House and his own party. \"I have access, I can speak to him,\" he said. \"I don't think he looks at me from the standpoint, 'Well you're the opposition party and you're the opposition.'\" Manchin said their rapport far surpasses his relationship with former President Barack Obama, of which he said \"there was none.\" Trump invited Manchin to Trump Tower in December to discuss a potential job as energy secretary. Not long after, Manchin announced  he'd be staying in the Senate . Still, he has visited the White House multiple times this year and speaks openly about conversing with Trump over the phone. Manchin has voted against only four of Trump's cabinet or major administration nominees -- casting the fewest \"no\" votes among Democrats -- and was the only one in his party to confirm Jeff Sessions for attorney general.  He also worked behind the scenes with a bipartisan group of senators in search  of a deal to avert the \"nuclear option\"  in the battle over Neil Gorsuch, Trump's pick for the Supreme Court. The talks were unsuccessful, and Manchin was vocal in his disappointment with both parties. He was one of three Democrats who ultimately went against their party's filibuster and voted to confirm Gorsuch. Manchin's relationship with the President -- as well as the senator's efforts to cozy up to conservative media outlets like Breitbart -- have generated buzz this year, and last week Manchin sounded open to a potential endorsement from Trump, though he said he hasn't spoken with the president about it. \"We'll just see,\" he said. \"We'll see if the political winds pull him in that direction.\" Manchin has also been critical of Trump at times. He opposed the President's initial executive order on immigration back in February and has sent sharp warnings against trying to repeal Obamacare, saying government should simply focus on repairing it. Still, in his interview with CNN, Manchin offered perhaps his highest compliment to Trump. \"President Trump, from all I can observe in the first 100 days, is operating like the governor of the United States,\" said Manchin, a former governor himself. Manchin still relishes his time as his state's chief executive (2005-2010) and almost achingly longs for that kind of role again. He's part of a former governors caucus in the Senate, where there's a running joke that the worst day as a governor is still better than the best day as a senator. \"We're the ones I think that can solve the problems. I really believe that. Because we had to,\" he said. \"We could never afford the luxury of being real right or real left.\" 'That will be a hard decision' Not being \"real right or real left\" can also be a fitting description for West Virginia voters.  Interviews with more than a dozen local residents in search of a job at the fair revealed not only mixed reviews of Manchin but a mosaic of perspectives that defy political norms. Some were Democrats who voted for Trump. Some were Republicans who liked Manchin. But most emphasized that, while they may be registered with a party, they primarily consider themselves independents.  Most shared a widespread distrust of politicians, even for the ones they like. Mike Mitchell, 66, a registered Democrat who votes \"for the person, not the party,\" wanted Clinton to win, but he backed Trump instead. And while he said he's \"happy\" with Manchin as his senator and plans to vote for him next year, he said at the end of the day he's \"not sure\" he can trust him. \"Government is awful. It's just very awful,\" Mitchell said. \"Do you trust in who you believe in? It's very hard anymore. Things are not like they used to be. Even around here.\" Jarrett Peters, 78, said he's not registered with any party and voted for Trump last year. He said he likes the way things are going in Washington under the new administration and plans to vote for Manchin. Eddie Edwards, another Democrat who voted for Trump, wasn't as pleased with the federal government, including Manchin. \"I guess he's our guy. I don't pay attention to politics because it pisses me off,\" Edwards said, expressing frustration at the lack of jobs in the area and federal attempts to roll back Obamacare. Marilyn Meade, a 63-year-old Democrat who also stressed that she votes \"for the person,\" preferred Bernie Sanders over Clinton in the primary, but said she likes Manchin's moderate spirit and stated that she'll be voting for him next year. To further demonstrate her independent approach, Meade added that she voted for her Republican congressman, Evan Jenkins.  It's that same congressman who's considering a challenge against Manchin next year, as is state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Meade was surprised to hear that Jenkins might run for the Senate, and her enthusiastic tone for Manchin suddenly changed. \"I don't know, that will be a hard decision,\" she said.  The forming opposition  Republicans, who feel they have a strong path to victory in West Virginia, are prepared to throw the kitchen sink at Manchin next year. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has already started linking his voting record -- and that of other vulnerable Democrats up for re-election -- to that of liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren and pointed out last week that her political action committee donated to his campaign. It's all part of an effort by Republicans to deflect attempts by these moderate Democrats to broaden their appeal among Trump voters.  \"Joe Manchin will speak conservative, but his actual voting record indicates otherwise,\" argued Conrad Lucas, chairman of the West Virginia GOP.  Also likely to come up is Manchin's 2013 proposal with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey to expand background checks on gun purchases, a position that drew sharp rebuke from gun rights activists, including the National Rifle Association.  Manchin, a gun owner himself, defended his compromise push four years ago, which failed to advance in the Senate. Manchin feels that the proposal now  has a greater chance of success under Trump than under Obama , because Second Amendment supporters won't be as worried that Trump will use it as a slippery slope toward more gun control.  \"There's no one who believes he's going to take their guns away,\" he said. Also anticipated from his opposition are attacks involving his daughter, Heather Bresch,  over criticism that her company, Mylan, raised prices for the life-saving medicine EpiPen by nearly 500% last year in order to enrich her company And Republicans are sure to reiterate Manchin's loyalty to Clinton last year, even after she made the damaging comment in a CNN town hall that she was \"going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\" Clinton later said it was a misstatement, but the quote still reverberated around the state. She won a dismal 27% of the vote there in November. Manchin described her comment as \"horrible\" but defended his continued support of her after the remark, saying, \"I don't think that was in her heart. I talked to her and we were going to do things for my state.\" \"I think the President respects and understands the loyalty that I had. I wasn't against, I was just for,\" he said. \"And that person I was for got defeated.\" 'I'm just going to get a boat' It's no secret that when Manchin is in Washington, he lives on a houseboat that he named \"Almost Heaven.\" It was both a practical and symbolic decision. \"I didn't want to be a permanent resident in Washington. And when you buy something, it's almost like you've anchored yourself down,\" he said. \"So I told my wife, I'm just going to get a boat.\" Multiple stories have been written about Manchin using his boat as a vessel to bring senators together behind the scenes, aided by some food and drinks. He said last week that sometimes they play music by country singer Lee Greenwood, most known for his song \"God Bless the USA,\" which Trump used as his walk-on music for campaign rallies. Manchin painted a hard-to-imagine picture of kumbaya moments on the boat. \"It's the most fulfilling thing to watch -- all these senators at the end of an evening, when we're together, hug each other and basically sing 'Proud to be an American,'\" he said. Manchin ranked No. 4 on a  bipartisan index by The Lugar Center and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy , which ranks senators based on how many pieces of legislation they worked on with members of the opposite party.  The only Democrat who had a higher ranking was Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who's also up for re-election next year in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. (The rankings measured legislative work from the 114th Congress, not the current session which started in January.) But acting as a bipartisan mediator can be a risky calculation during such partisan times. While it can appeal to more moderate voters, it can also remove the security blanket of getting the full support from your own party, and it can draw accusations of being a fair-weather politician based on the changing moods among voters. Manchin, as he approaches what's expected to be a tough race, appears to be comfortably set in what can sometimes look like political no-man's land.  \"The country is getting further and further apart. You know, you're on the right or the left. There's no middle,\" he said. \"And I'm not leaving the middle.\"","articles_date":"27 4 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/27\/politics\/joe-manchin-trump-hundred-days\/index.html","articles_title":"Manchin charts own path in Trump-era West Virginia ","candidate_fk":5,"first_name":"Patrick","id":178,"issue":8,"last_name":"Morrisey","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Sens. Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp on Thursday became the first Senate Democrats to announce their support for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch -- breaking with their colleagues who have blasted President Trump's pick.\u00a0 \u201cSenators have a constitutional obligation to advice (sic) and consent on a nominee to fill this Supreme Court vacancy and, simply put, we have a responsibility to do our jobs as elected officials,\u201d Manchin, of West Virginia, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cI will vote to confirm him to be the ninth justice on the Supreme Court.\u201d\u00a0 I will vote to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the ninth justice on the Supreme Court.

She added that her vote \"does not diminish how disturbed I am by what Republicans did to Judge Garland,\" former President Barack Obama's nominee who was blocked by the GOP-led Senate.\u00a0 While two Democrats have now come out in favor of Gorsuch, opposition in the party runs deep.

If they can't, they may employ a procedural tactic to change Senate precedent and push the nominee through.\u00a0 This week, Vice President Mike Pence was in West Virginia, Manchin\u2019s home state, urging that he vote \u2018yes\u2019 for Gorsuch. \u201cThroughout Judge Gorsuch\u2019s career, he has come to his legal rulings objectively, through the letter of the law rather than through his own opinion,\u201d Manchin said in his statement. \u201cI hold no illusions that I will agree with every decision Judge Gorsuch may issue in the future, but I have not found any reasons why this jurist should not be a Supreme Court Justice.\u201d The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on April 3. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-K.Y., said they plan to vote to confirm Gorsuch on the Senate floor on April 7.\u00a0 Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Background: Brent Benjamin won his seat as the Chief Justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court in a 2004 statewide election. The man who is perhaps most responsible for Benjamin's spot on the court is Don Blankenship, CEO of Massey Coal one of the largest companies in the Mountaineer State. Blankenship spent $3 million in advertisements to help Benjamin's cause. That amount represents 60 percent of all money spent on behalf of the Benjamin campaign. There is no argument that the donations were legal. After the election, Blankenship's company appealed an adverse $50 million judgment to the West Virginia State Supreme Court now presided by the man he help put there. Justice Benjamin refused to recuse himself from the case saying there was no conflict of interest and his ability as a jurist would not impact his ability to render a fair decision. Benjamin cast the deciding vote in Massey's favor setting aside the $50 million judgment. The losing side in the dispute\u2014a collection of smaller coal companies\u2014contends their Due Process rights were violated by Benjamin's decision to remain in the case. In its brief to the Supreme Court they argue Benjamin's presence \"created a constitutionally unacceptable probability\" of bias. Lawyers for Massey Coal contend recusal is necessary only when a judge has a \"pecuniary\" interest in the outcome. Something they say is not at issue in this case. They also point out that Justice Benjamin has voted against them at least five other times in cases totaling in excess of $243 million. Earlier this year, Benjamin announced he would no longer take part in Massey Coal cases saying it would be disrespectful while the matter is before the Supreme Court. This case is seen by some interests as a prime example why judges shouldn't be elected in the first place. The case also closely parallels the 2008 John Grisham book \"The Appeal.\" Date: Tuesday, March 3, 2009 Issue: This case is about the availability of relief under the Federal Arbitration Act when third parties attempt to force arbitration in federal courts. Background: After Wayne Carlisle and two associates sold their construction business they wanted help in setting up tax shelters for their profits. They eventually partnered with a firm called Bricolage who worked with other companies setting up the shelter. As part of the agreement with Bricolage, Carlisle and his business partners signed a contract providing for arbitration in case of a dispute. As it turned out, the IRS said the shelter was illegal and initially allowed Carlisle some extra time to make good on his tax obligations. But Carlisle says the firm the IRS reached out to never informed him of that grace period. Eventually the IRS cracked down on Carlisle for the failure to pay his original tax burden and added fines and interest all totaling in excess of $20 Million. Carlisle sued Bricolage and eight other interests saying they were responsible for his tax mess. The arbitration agreement with Bricolage was enacted\u2014but only with Bricolage. The other eight firms were left to defend themselves in court. They argue they too should be covered by the arbitration agreement.","articles_date":"18 03 2009","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/story\/2009\/03\/18\/march-3-west-virginia-judges-and-arbitration.html","articles_title":"March 3: West Virginia Judges and Arbitration","candidate_fk":1,"first_name":"Don","id":181,"issue":6,"last_name":"Blankenship","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Outside the Capitol Building on Tuesday sat dozens of cardboard cutouts depicting Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, wearing a characteristic T-shirt emblazoned with the message \u201cFix Fakebook.\u201d Inside, clad in a navy suit and bright blue tie, Mr. Zuckerberg appeared before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees as he really is: the billionaire leader of one of the world\u2019s most powerful commercial and civic enterprises. Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance, his first before Congress, turned into something of a pointed gripe session, with both Democratic and Republican senators attacking Facebook for failing to protect users\u2019 data and stop Russian election interference, and raising questions about whether Facebook should be more heavily regulated. Of specific interest were the revelations that sensitive data of as many as 87 million Facebook users were harvested without explicit permission by a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, which was connected to the Trump campaign. Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, appeared confident and answered questions directly, and his performance helped bolster Facebook\u2019s stock, which ended the day up 4.5 percent. It was the first of two marathon hearings; the second will be before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday. He was forced to admit mistakes and take responsibility for his company\u2019s actions \u2014 as have the many tobacco, pharmaceutical and bank executives who have been summoned to Washington. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty much impossible, I believe, to start a company in your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we\u2019re at now without making some mistakes,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, zeroed in on the central issue of the hearing, asking Mr. Zuckerberg whether he would be comfortable sharing aloud the name of the hotel where he stayed on Monday night, or whether he would be comfortable sharing the names of the people he has messaged this week. \u201cNo. I would probably not choose to do that publicly here,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cI think that may be what this is all about,\u201d Mr. Durbin said. \u201cYour right to privacy. The limits of your right to privacy. And how much you give away in modern America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg was the only technology chief in the room, but he was often treated as a stand-in for the whole industry. Facebook has come under intense criticism for the Cambridge Analytica leak and for its initial response, which set off a #DeleteFacebook campaign online and sent the stock plunging more than 15 percent. But the hearing was about more than Facebook; it exposed a critical turning point as the power, sophistication and potential exploitation of technology outpaces what users, regulators or even its creators expected or seem prepared to handle. The moment is creating a showdown between two national power centers \u2014 Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 as they jockey in a technology-centric world. Although Washington has long served as a check on the power of Wall Street and other profitable industries, lawmakers have tended to act as cheerleaders for technology companies rather than watchdogs. Light regulation enabled a culture of freewheeling innovation, and the beloved products that Silicon Valley companies created made them politically convenient allies. Today, five of the eight largest companies in the world are West Coast technology companies. Only a single East Coast institution, JPMorgan Chase, cracks the top 10. And lawmakers on both sides of the aisle suggested that Facebook and other companies may not be able to police themselves. \u201cHave you gotten too big?\u201d Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, asked Mr. Zuckerberg, before suggesting that Facebook might need to be reined in to protect it from itself. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook had become a monopoly, asking why Congress \u201cshould let you self-regulate?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said he welcomed some form of regulation, as long as it was the \u201cright regulation.\u201d He also expressed support for the Honest Ads Act, a bill in Congress that would require more disclosures from online political advertisers. His answers did not mollify lawmakers, including Mr. Graham, who said in a statement after the hearing that \u201ccontinued self-regulation is not the right answer when it comes to dealing with the abuses we have seen on Facebook.\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview that he was \u201cunsatisfied\u201d and that it was clear Facebook could not and would not fully regulate itself and that Congress needed to provide a solution. \u201cThe old saying: There ought to be a law,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be a law. Unless there\u2019s a law, their business model is going to continue to maximize profit over privacy.\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance before more than 40 senators came after weeks of preparation, and it appeared to pay off, as he seemed calm, deferential and prepared. Mr. Zuckerberg offered humor about the company\u2019s onetime mantra: \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d (It has since been edited to \u201cmove fast with stable infrastructure.\u201d) He insisted on continuing questions when offered a break, eliciting smiles and laughter from staff sitting behind him. However, when Mr. Zuckerberg did take a break, he left behind his notes, which were quickly photographed and contained talking points for various topics including \u201cDefend Facebook,\u201d \u201cDisturbing Content\u201d and \u201cElection integrity (Russia).\u201d His performance won accolades on Wall Street. \u201cThis is a different Mark Zuckerberg than the Street was fearing,\u201d said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s a defining 48 hours that will determine the future of Facebook, and so far he has passed with flying colors, and the Street is relieved.\u201d But Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that his idealistic view of humanity, and those of his fellow executives, had exposed Facebook\u2019s roughly 2.2 billion users to danger. Among them: Facebook failed to detect and stop Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, an oversight that Mr. Zuckerberg called \u201cone of my greatest regrets.\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Facebook and its role in society \u201cextraordinary\u201d and began the hearing by explaining that Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg were being singled out because of the company\u2019s power. Mr. Thune said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how Facebook could be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared \u201cto be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users\u2019 information.\u201d In an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, \u201cIn the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies\u2019 efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg was careful when pressed on how he defined the company, wary of opening it up to new legal liability. He said that Facebook was responsible for the content on the social network, but he argued that it was a technology company, rather than a publisher. \u201cI agree that we\u2019re responsible for the content,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t produce the content.\u201d The primary thing that Facebook does, he added, is employ engineers and build products. Some of the hardest questions came from Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, whose name is being floated for a presidential bid. Ms. Harris pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook executives made a decision not to inform users about the Cambridge Analytica data leak when they learned in 2015 that data was sold by a researcher to the political consulting firm. The question was crucial to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s investigation of Facebook\u2019s violation of a 2011 agreement to protect users\u2019 privacy. If the company withheld information, which violates its agreement, the company could face record fines. Mr. Zuckerberg did not admit that the company explicitly decided to withhold that information from consumers, but he said the company had made a mistake in not informing users. There were glimmers of a partisan divide during the hearing. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, asked about Facebook\u2019s handling of conservative media, including content related to Glenn Beck and a Fox News personality; Democrats questioned Mr. Zuckerberg on how quickly Facebook responded to Russian meddling in the election. But the dominant theme of the day was uncertainty about how to deal with Facebook, a complex, multifaceted giant that even technologists have struggled to define. Lawmakers \u2014 many of whom grew up in an era without social media \u2014 labored at times to understand the fine-grain nuances of Facebook\u2019s business model, such as the difference between selling user data to advertisers and allowing advertisers to target ads to an aggregated slice of Facebook users. At one point, Mr. Zuckerberg was forced to shoot down a conspiracy theory floated by Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, that Facebook listens to users through their microphones in order to serve them ads. Mr. Zuckerberg, who spent weeks being coached for the hearing by a team of outside experts, remained cool and collected while fielding question after question. But the lawmakers\u2019 technical sophistication was mostly irrelevant \u2014 by the end of the session, the warning had been sent: In order to avoid a much harsher regulatory glare that could include major punitive measures, Facebook needs to stop apologizing, get its act together, and show that it is capable of changing. \u201cThis episode has clearly hurt us,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe have to do a lot of work about building trust back.\u201d","articles_date":"10 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/10\/us\/politics\/zuckerberg-facebook-senate-hearing.html","articles_title":"Mark Zuckerberg Testifies on Facebook Before Skeptical Lawmakers","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":182,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson don't need a new war authorization to fight ISIS, they told Congress on Wednesday. But if Congress wants to pass one, then they'd be happy to support it. Mattis and Tillerson discussed the prospects for a new war authorization behind closed doors with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where lawmakers said they had a productive discussion but aren't necessarily closer to resolving the prickly issues that have kept Congress from passing an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) since the US began fighting ISIS in 2014. Sen. Tim Kaine, who has led the push in the Senate to vote on the ISIS war, said he was encouraged by the discussion with Mattis and Tillerson. \"They were very open to the idea of working on an authorization, not because they feel like they legally have to have it, but they think for the mission itself it would be good to have Congress engaged in that way,\" the Virginia Democrat told reporters after leaving the classified setting. But the Trump administration made clear ahead of Wednesday's briefing that the military did have the legal authority it needed. The State Department sent Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker a letter Wednesday stating the US \"has sufficient legal authority to prosecute the campaign against al Qaeda and associated forces, including against the Islamic State.\" \"They were very clear in their responses -- the administration is not seeking an AUMF,\" Corker said. \"I'm confident they'll work with us. They're not seeking one. But I think they saw there's an effort to do something.\" Nevertheless, the closed briefing with national security leaders was another step signaling renewed momentum on Capitol Hill for Congress to finally vote on the war. But there are still significant roadblocks to passing a new Authorization for Use of Military Force to replace the 2001 authorization still being used by the US military to fight ISIS, al Qaeda and others across the globe. A small group of lawmakers from both parties have long been pushing for Congress to pass a new authorization for the war against ISIS, and their effort received a jolt in the arm in June when a House panel  voted to repeal  the 2001 war authorization, a 60-word broad authorization approved just days after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. The amendment to the defense appropriations bill from Rep. Barbara Lee -- a California Democrat who was the only member of Congress to vote against the 2001 AUMF -- would have repealed that authorization while giving Congress eight months to pass a new one. But her effort was  stripped from the underlying defense bill  by House Republican leadership when it went to the floor last week, as House Speaker Paul Ryan argued the spending measure was an inappropriate means to debate the war. In the Senate, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is holding hearings on the issue, but so far Senate leadership hasn't indicated a desire to pivot to the issue on the floor. \"Mitch McConnell has so many fires right now, that the last thing he wants to do is something that doesn't have a predictable outcome,\" a Democratic senator told CNN. The problem with trying to pass a war authorization is twofold: Many lawmakers are still wary of the way that the 2002 vote for the Iraq War was used against Hillary Clinton in both the 2008 and 2016 presidential elections. In addition, while most lawmakers support a new war authorization to fight ISIS, there are major disagreements over the details, including whether to allow or restrict US ground troops, the length of time for the authorization and whether to have geographical restrictions. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, whose committee is hearing from Mattis and Tillerson Wednesday afternoon, said he's still assessing what the next steps are to debate and mark up a war authorization, with a public hearing the next likely step. Kaine and Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona  introduced a war authorization  in May, which they hope is a bipartisan path to voting on the ISIS plan. The Trump administration, like the Obama administration before it, believes it has the legal authority to fight ISIS with the 2001 war authorization, and it has not requested an updated version. The Trump administration also asserted it had legal authority to strike the Syrian government based on the same authorization. Still, at a Senate hearing earlier this year, Mattis endorsed the idea of Congress voting to endorse the ISIS war. \"I think it would be a statement of the American people's resolve if you did so,\" he said. Corker and Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel, said they're working toward marking up a new war authorization. Corker said Wednesday that the discussion was helpful in beginning to address some of the sticking points on a new authorization. \"Secretary Mattis was very helpful in talking through some of the caveats that people might want to put in place,\" Corker said. A key issue to watch will be how the bill would deal with the issue of ground troops -- many Republicans want no restrictions on the commander-in-chief and most Democrats argue they're hoping to prevent another open-ended US ground war in the Middle East. \"It can't be a lessening, in my opinion, of the options the president has,\" said North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis. But Cardin told reporters Tuesday he believes the new war authorization should allow for US troops to conduct special operations and other targeted missions in the ISIS war, but that US ground forces should be prohibited. He argued many Republicans are coming around, too, an idea that would be tested if a war authorization did come to the Senate floor. \"I think the landscape has changed in two years, I really do,\" Cardin said. \"I think there's now more and more members of the Senate who recognize ground troops is not the answer.\" CNN's Emily Karl contributed reporting","articles_date":"2 8 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/08\/02\/politics\/mattis-tillerson-isis-war\/index.html","articles_title":"Mattis, Tillerson talk authorizing ISIS war","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":183,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Democratic mayors came to Washington this week to rail against Washington -- and to insist they could run the city better.  Hundreds of mayors of both parties gathered at the Capital Hilton for the annual US Conference of Mayors winter meeting. Among the Democrats, there were 2020 presidential prospects in Los Angeles' Eric Garcetti and New Orleans' Mitch Landrieu; those set on carving out national identities, like New York's Bill de Blasio, Chicago's Rahm Emanuel and South Bend, Indiana's Pete Buttigieg; and more who are running for Congress this year.  As executives with broad authority and no place to shift blame for inaction, the Democratic mayors said, they represent a clean break from the slow-moving, crisis-to-crisis lurch of the federal government.  LA Mayor Garcetti says men should make gender equality a top issue \"Anybody that's watched us has to be startled by the difference between watching us work and watching Congress work,\" Landrieu, the chairman of the mayors' conference, said in an interview. \"There's no way for city government to shut down. There's no way for us not to balance our budget. And so hopefully we're mirroring leadership to Congress.\"  He said mayors wanted to \"model engaging constructively\" for Congress \"as they get through their difficult times.\"   \"Congress doesn't seem to understand the need to move with speed, or the need to move at all,\" Landrieu said.  The Democratic mayors began their trip with an unexpected brawl with President Donald Trump after a Justice Department move to crack down on sanctuary cities. Landrieu and de Blasio responded by canceling their visit to the White House scheduled only hours later. Garcetti, Emanuel, Buttigieg and others weren't invited -- but said they wouldn't go even if they had been.  \"Hell no,\" said Mayor Ted Wheeler of Portland, Oregon.  For 2020 prospects like Garcetti and Landrieu, the week was a chance to build relationships with potentially important endorsers, court potential donors and talk about national issues.  In a speech Thursday, Garcetti blasted Trump for pulling out of the Paris climate accord and for his handling of young undocumented immigrants while saying, \"We're not going backwards.\"  National political figures are rarely plucked from the ranks of America's mayors. Like former Mayor Tim Kaine of Richmond, Virginia, who's now a US senator after serving as Virginia's governor, they typically need higher-profile, statewide roles first.  But the Democratic Party's search for new leaders -- combined with Trump's moves on issues like sanctuary cities and Confederate monuments -- has elevated the profiles of mayors who already weren't shy about their ambitions. Mayors like Garcetti and Buttigieg have popped up in early presidential primary states. De Blasio visited Iowa last month. Landrieu is a darling of some Southern Democratic strategists.  Others, including Phoenix's Greg Stanton and Jim Gray of Lexington, Kentucky, are among the party's top recruits for House races in 2018.  Buttigieg used the week to launch a new automation task force through the mayors' conference -- which he'll chair. Garcetti got a prime speaking slot and used it to discuss gender equity and the #MeToo movement.  \"Men, own this as your issue,\" he said. \"Let's not talk about doing it because we have daughters and sisters and mothers. Do it because we know our cities will be more prosperous when we, as leaders, step up.\"   CNN's Morgan Stephens contributed to this report.","articles_date":"25 1 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/01\/25\/politics\/democrats-mayors-washington-conference\/index.html","articles_title":"Mayors come to Washington to take on Washington","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":184,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will delay the vote on the Republican leadership's health care bill until after the July 4 recess. McConnell told GOP senators that he wants to make changes to the bill, get a new Congressional Budget Office score and have a vote after the holiday, two sources told CNN. Following McConnell's decision, President Donald Trump said negotiators are continuing to work and \"getting very close\" on a deal and that Obamacare was \"melting down as we speak.\" \"We are going to talk,\" Trump told reporters during a meeting with Republican senators, who had been bussed from Capitol Hill to the White House. \"We are going to see what we are going to do. We are getting very close.\" Trump added, \"For the country, we have to have health care and it can't be Obamacare, which is melting down. The other side is saying all sorts of things before they even knew what the bill was. This will be great if we get it done and if we don't get it done it is just going to be something we aren't going to like. And that is OK and I understand that very well.\" RELATED: Susan Collins: Trump hasn't learned how to work with Congress McConnell's decision does not mean Republicans' plans for repealing and replacing Obamacare are dead, but it highlights the challenge facing the GOP leadership as they try to bridge the divide between conservatives and moderates in the party. While the additional time could allow for more negotiations to bring more lawmakers on board, it also means members of Congress could face pressure from constituents when they go home for recess with the future of health care hanging in limbo.  A senior Senate Republican aide told CNN that the plan for the moment is to hammer out a compromise bill by the end of this week, give members the full week of recess to digest and then vote on it when they get back.  RELATED: Who gets hurt and who gets helped by the Senate health care bill \"We know what everyone needs,\" the aide said. \"Now we just need to make it work.\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump spoke with McConnell on Tuesday morning and has been \"fully engaged\" with senators. \"For us, it is never been about the timeline but getting the best piece of legislation that helps the most,\" Sanders said. The news followed a bustling morning in the Capitol, where Republican leaders, along with Pence, were meeting behind closed doors with the bill's opponents, as a number of senators came out against voting for a procedural step to advance their plans to repeal and replace Obamacare.  Mike Lee became the fifth member Tuesday to plan to vote against the motion to proceed on the health care bill as it is currently written, an aide told CNN. The motion is normally a routine procedural move, but its chances were growing increasingly grim due to the Republican intraparty division. With Republicans only able afford the loss of two votes, the bill appeared to be teetering on the edge by lunchtime. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, told reporters the effort to get to 50 votes was \"fluid\" but maintained a degree of hope. \"I wouldn't count McConnell out yet.\" Meanwhile, Democrats on the Hill were organizing news conference after news conference, including a large showing of Democratic senators who gathered on the Capitol steps to lambast the beleaguered bill. Behind the scenes, staffers for McConnell were trading potential legislative proposals with key offices, and McConnell himself met privately with Sen. Ted Cruz for nearly an hour. While the Texas Republican hadn't said how he'd vote on the motion to proceed -- he had previously been publicly opposed to the bill though open to negotiations. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, had been largely quiet since the bill went public last week. She's long been a question mark on how she would vote on the bill, and she told CNN Tuesday morning that she's \"concerned about the bill in the form that it is now.\" Asked later if there needs to be more opioid funding in the bill, Capito said that was just one of the issues. \"That's not the only one,\" Capito told reporters. Aides were also seen scurrying around in the Capitol trying to buttonhole members and their key staff about where things currently stand, with the idea being to have a menu of options ready for the Senate Republicans' weekly Tuesday lunch, where McConnell ultimately announced his decision to delay.  The lunch, according to an aide, was expected to be at effort to both rally the troops and serve as a policy discussion. For McConnell's part, according to the aide, the message would be clear: A vote against the bill would be a vote to maintain Obamacare. If the bill failed, McConnell was set to argue, the only option would be to work with Democrats, which would lead to a less conservative outcome. Pence expressed uncertainty earlier Tuesday on whether the bill would make it to the floor. \"We'll see,\" he told CNN as he entered a meeting in the Capitol.  Pressed on what they are doing to salvage the bill, Pence responded, \"lots of good discussions underway and we'll continue to work very diligently.\" RELATED: Senate Republican health bill: Pay more, get less Also at the Capitol Tuesday was Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who was scheduled to hold meetings with Pence, McConnell and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida. Rubio, like some senators, had been waiting to make his decision on the bill until he felt like he had enough input from his state's governor and other constituents. An aide to the senator said Rubio's staff invited staff from the offices of Scott -- as well as the Florida speaker and Senate president -- to Washington to be \"embedded\" in Rubio's office for the week and work with Rubio's team to analyze how the bill will affect Florida.   Over on the House side, Speaker Paul Ryan urged his members in a closed door session to give their Senate colleagues some space, according to a person in the room. Ryan's point was that given the current state of play, it's not helpful for anyone in the House to come out and attack or criticize elements of the bill. Should the Senate pass the bill, Ryan argued, the House will get their chance, one way or another, to weigh in. Until then, he urged members to hold their fire.

After Trump's  incendiary language  and his rejection of a bipartisan deal last week, Democrats may be leaning more toward withholding their votes on a spending compromise. But at least one Democrat said he'll vote to support a continuing resolution. Sen. Joe Manchin, a red state Democrat up in 2018, told reporters Tuesday he will vote to keep the government funded even without a DACA deal. \"I'll vote to keep the government open,\" the West Virginia senator said. If the House passes a stopgap measure to keep the government running ahead of the Friday deadline, McConnell will need at least nine Democrats in the chamber to vote \"yes\" again on a short-term funding bill -- and he may need more, depending on whether any Republicans vote against the continuing resolution or are absent due to health reasons. Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said he won't support a short term spending bill that doesn't include DACA fix. \"I will vote against a clean (continuing resolution) if it does not include DACA, a fix to some of the other things that are high priorities to me. Why are we kicking the can down the road?\" Booker said. Other Democrats who supported the last stop gap measure in December said Tuesday they were unsure where they stood on plans to extend funding again.  Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Demcorats, told CNN that he is reluctant to vote for another CR if it doesn't include DACA, but that he has not made up his mind yet. \"I'm just tired of voting for CRs,\" King said. He added that he also wants to see re-authorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program to be included, which Republicans could use as a bargaining chip to attract red state Democrats. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia wouldn't say Tuesday night whether he'd support the short term bill without a DACA fix. \"We want to see what's in it and then we're going to decide,\" he said. \"We need to do a DACA deal.

This is just trying to make sure that Virginians are kept safe,\" McDonnell spokeswoman Stacey Johnson told FoxNews.com.\u00a0 She said the governor has been talking to federal officials about the idea for the past couple months and that the details of the arrangement \"will be announced in the coming weeks.\"\u00a0 McDonnell is trying to expand authority through a program known as 287g -- an agreement dozens of localities across the country have forged with Immigration and Customs Enforcement that trains local officers in immigration enforcement. The program allows the officers to carry out some of those duties under ICE supervision.\u00a0 ICE would not comment on the negotiations with Virginia. If the deal is sealed, McDonnell's state would join several others in implementing the partnership for state law enforcement.\u00a0 It's unclear whether the governor would take any action to codify Cuccinelli's decision or if he would even need to. McDonnell described the ruling Tuesday as nothing new.\u00a0 Cuccinelli described his opinion as a clarification of the law. He explained that Virginia law allows state law enforcement to check immigration status but does not require it -- the section of the Arizona law that mandated the immigration checks was blocked by a federal judge last week pending litigation.\u00a0 Virginia is pursuing tougher immigration policies on several fronts, with officials claiming their actions will be able to withstand legal challenge.\u00a0 \"We're very prudent, we take our time -- measured responses,\" said state Republican Delegate Robert Marshall, who originally requested the ruling from Cuccinelli.\u00a0  Board of County Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart is pushing a separate statewide bill that would bring an Arizona-style system to Virginia. The proposal would require police to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest. Stewart, who claims his proposal avoids the legal pitfalls that have tripped up Arizona, has launched a political action committee to raise money for a public campaign in support of the bill and has started a website where he is trying to collect 100,000 signatures.\u00a0 Senate Democratic Leader Richard Saslaw, though, said the proposal doesn't stand a chance. He also cast doubt on whether Cuccinelli's ruling would have any impact on Virginia police operations.\u00a0 Should a deal be struck with ICE, Virginia would join  , Arizona, Colorado,  , Florida, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Tennessee in extending the program to state police.

Beto O'Rourke, the Texas Democrat running to unseat Ted Cruz from the Senate, said he outraised his Republican opponent for the final quarter of 2017.  At an event in Houston on Sunday night, O'Rourke  announced  that his campaign had raised $2.4 million, noting that the amount came from 55,000 individual contributions.  \"Texans have stepped up in this campaign,\" O'Rourke said. \"We have 55,000 individual contributions ... the average contribution online is 25 bucks, and that is what is powering this campaign.\" According to the Dallas Morning News, the Cruz campaign took in $1.9 million in the last quarter of 2017. However, the incumbent Republican maintains an advantage when it comes to cash on hand, ending the year with $7.3 million -- as opposed to O'Rourke's $4.6 million, according to their report. The Cruz campaign did not immediately return CNN's request for comment.  The fundraising announcements came days before the Federal Election Commission filings deadline on Wednesday.  O'Rourke is serving his third term in the House, representing El Paso. He launched his Senate campaign in late March 2017 and has refused to accept any corporate money or donations from political action committees -- a pledge that stretches back to his first run for the House.  In an interview with CNN  shortly after the start of his bid, O'Rourke acknowledged that his campaign would be seen as a long shot but said he'd \"like nothing more for the establishment to count us out.\"  Despite his high-fundraising dollars, at least one expert doesn't think O'Rourke stands much of a chance of unseating Cruz. Josh Blank, the manager of polling and research for the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, told CNN that the numbers don't \"change the fundamentals\" of the deep-red state. Texas has not had a Democratic senator since 1993.  \"It's a real uphill climb for him,\" Blank said, noting that O'Rourke likely benefited from launching his campaign early and being boosted by the Democratic establishment. Despite the national recognition, Blank said O'Rourke will likely have a difficult time translating that to the local electorate. In an October 2017 University of Texas\/Texas Tribune  poll of O'Rourke's favorability , the majority of respondents (53%) didn't know or had no opinion of the Democrat, and 16% found him neither favorable or unfavorable.

Signer, who wrote a book on political demagoguery, called for unity and a national effort to recognize and combat racism. But he also believes Trump emboldened the activists who gathered in his city in the wake of a  decision to remove a statue  of Confederate icon Robert E. Lee. \"Look at the campaign he ran,\" Signer, a Democrat, told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" Sunday. \"Look at the intentional courting both, on the one hand, of all these white supremacists, white nationalist groups like that, anti-Semitic groups,\" Signer said. \"And then look on the other hand, the repeated failure to step up, condemn, denounce, silence, you know, put to bed all those different efforts.\" Long involvement in Democratic politics Signer went to Princeton, attended law school at the University of Virginia and got a Ph.D. in political science from the University of California at Berkeley,  according to his personal website. He has a long history in Democratic politics, including working as counsel for then-Virginia Gov. Mark Warner, as senior strategist for Tom Perriello's 2008 campaign for Congress and as national security director for John Edwards' 2008 presidential campaign. Signer ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor of Virginia in 2009, and then was appointed by then-Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine to a four-year term on Virginia's Board of Medicine. As an author, he has made a 15-year study of political demagogues and wrote a book: \"Demagogue: The Fight to Save Democracy from Its Worst Enemies\" on the topic. Signer currently works as general counsel at WillowTree, Inc., a mobile development company in Charlottesville. He is married to Emily Blout, who teaches at American University. Trump 'a demagogue' This isn't the first time Signer has accused Trump of race-baiting. He told CNN in September 2015 that then-candidate Trump had classic demagogue qualities. \"Despite his prior glitzy image, Trump started becoming a demagogue when he started trying to lead a 'silent majority' of furious, mostly white, lower- and middle-class voters,\" Signer told CNN  in December 2015. He's continued his criticism over the weekend, after he said Trump emboldened racists with his campaign -- and then told CNN's \"New Day\" on Monday morning that even though he's spent enough time talking about Trump's statement on Charlottesville this weekend, he added, \"I think it speaks for itself.\" He was referencing Trump's statement failed to condemn white supremacists or the \"alt-right\" for violence that left three people dead n the Virginia city. \"I've already spent enough time talking about Donald Trump.

Sam Brownback to be ambassador at large for international religious freedom. It was Pence's second time breaking a tie on Wednesday. Earlier, he had raced to Capitol Hill after a 49-49 tie to end a filibuster of Brownback's nomination. He was again needed to vote later in the day on the final confirmation vote, 50-49. Republicans control 51 seats in the chamber but two GOP senators were not present to vote: Sen. John McCain, who's battling cancer in Arizona, and Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who's in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum.  Throughout the tax reform battle in the fall, Democrats often cited tax cuts in Kansas -- which Brownback supported -- that were later repealed after the state's economy struggled. Brownback, a former senator himself, had been seen on Capitol Hill in recent months lobbying senators to back his nomination.  Democrats had also brought up concerns about Brownback's confirmation hearing in October. At the time, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Brownback if there was any circumstance in which religious freedom could justify \"criminalizing, imprisoning or executing\" someone based on sexual orientation.   \"I don't know what that would be, in what circumstance, but I would continue the policies that have been done in the prior administration in working on these international issues,\" he said.  Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, argued on the Senate floor Wednesday that Brownback's answer was insufficient.  \"Governor Brownback could not bring himself to muster a resounding 'no,' \" Menendez said. \"Condemning such horrific human rights abuses should never be a heavy lift for anyone who seeks to represent our nation on the global stage.\" According to  The Kansas City Star , Brownback later clarified his answer in a written response  \"Violence or persecution in the name of religion against members of the LGBT community is wrong, as is persecution or violence based on gender, race, faith, age, heritage, national origin, or disability,\" Brownback wrote. RELATED: Mike Pence is breaking ties in the Senate at a record-setting pace As Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, headed into Brownback's confirmation vote, he was asked about the opposition to Brownback, which is unusual for nominees who are former senators.  \"Sometimes politics trumps friendships around here,\" Hatch said. \"And it shouldn't.\" As president of the Senate, the vice president has a unique relationship with the upper chamber and can cast a tie-breaking vote in the rare event the Senate is evenly split. Since the 1870s,  each vice president has done this fewer than 10 times during his tenure .  While Pence has been vice president, Republicans have maintained a thin margin over Democrats in the Senate, which increases the likelihood of a tie. For all of 2017, Republicans numbered 52, compared with Democrats at 48. That balance changed to 51-49 in January, after Democrat Doug Jones was sworn in following his victory in the December special election in Alabama. Tie-breaking votes are also more common now because the threshold for passage on procedural votes like the one Wednesday was lowered from 60 votes to 50 in 2013, essentially creating more opportunities for a tie.

Dogged by deep ideological schisms within his conference, McConnell  postponed a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare  until his party can find a way to come together.   But more days of negotiations may not make the problem any easier. When Ryan was looking for the solution, he could afford to lose nearly two dozen members. McConnell can only lose two. It's not simply that members want more time to look over the bill or review it. There are significant divisions within the party over what a Republican health care plan should even look like. Moderate Republicans -- many of whom come from states that have been better able to help low-income people get health care coverage because of Medicaid expansion -- are dubious of rolling back federal dollars for their states. Without the money, there is fear that vulnerable populations could find themselves once again unable to afford health care.  But conservatives believe that Republicans have an obligation to stay true to their campaign promise. The promise was not to repeal parts of Obamacare, but leave the basic infrastructure -- the market place, the subsidies, the federal enhanced dollars for Medicaid-- in place. They argue, the promise was to repeal the program \"root and branch.\"   Here's more on what key Republicans are looking for: Rob Portman (Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (West Virginia) and Susan Collins (Maine): more opioid funding. The Senate's health care bill included just a drop in the bucket -- $2 billion -- to tackle the opioid crisis. Capito and Portman had requested $45 billion. That shows just how far off their ask leadership was.  The idea all along has been that Republican leadership has more money to negotiate with if they need to. They could increase the funding as a way to sweeten the deal for moderates, but so far it's unclear exactly how much that funding will grow. Sen. Dean Heller (Nevada), Shelley Moore Capito and Rob Portman: Return the Medicaid growth rate to Medical inflation This ask is a bit in the weeds, but here it goes.  The Senate bill -- in 2025 -- would begin tying the growth rate for Medicaid funding to standard inflation (CPI-U) instead of the more generous medical inflation (CPI-M). Medical costs are growing faster right now than the cost of other goods so if you tie Medicaid funding to standard inflation it means over time states would get less many from the federal government. Moderates are deeply concerned about what that cut could mean for their states. Medicaid is expensive, and if the states start to receive less money from the feds, it ultimately means they either have to find the money elsewhere to make up the gap or they have to start cutting benefits. That violates the promise that moderates made to not \"pull the rug out\" from vulnerable populations. From the beginning, moderates told leadership this was a non-starter, but it ultimately was included in the bill to woo conservatives like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Ted Cruz (Texas), Mike Lee  (Utah), Rand Paul (Kentucky) and Ron Johnson (Wisconsin): More flexibility and fewer Obamacare regulations. This is where the conservatives come in. In addition to wanting the opposite of what moderates want on Medicaid funding, conservatives are also negotiating with leadership to try to make sure that more Obamacare regulations are repealed. They have several suggestions for doing this, but one of the ideas is to allow more insurance plans to be exempted from Obamacare regulations. The conservative argument is that in order to lower premiums, you have to free insurers from having to offer things like essential health benefits or community rating, one of the key protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Community rating bars people from being charged more based off their past medical history.  Moderates, of course, worry that rolling back something like \"community rating\" could hurt people with pre-existing conditions. They are against going that far. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska): Strip the provision that defunds Planned Parenthood As if this wasn't already complicated enough, the two moderate Republicans are asking for leadership to take out a provision in that defunds Planned Parenthood for a year. They argue Planned Parenthood provides key services to women and shouldn't be defunded. But, of course, conservatives say that the Planned Parenthood defund must remain in the bill to get their support. There is also pressure from the religious right to ensure that this provision stays in the bill. Without it, conservatives might vote against it.  Rand Paul: Get rid of the Obamacare subsidies   Paul continues to argue that Republicans shouldn't be spending money on what he calls another \"entitlement.\" Paul is opposed to the subsidies in the Senate bill, which help low-income people buy health insurance and are more robust for low-income people than the ones in the House bill. Paul argues they are nothing more than \"Obamacare lite.\"  He's pretty much out on his own on this one, but it's one of the reasons why this negotiation is so tough for McConnell. Every vote counts. Even those votes on the fringes.","articles_date":"28 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/28\/politics\/mcconnell-challenges-on-health-care\/index.html","articles_title":"Mitch McConnell's myriad of challenges on health care","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":192,"issue":2,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"OMAHA, Neb. \u2014  Just 18 months after declaring his opposition to banning assault weapons, Nebraska Democrat Brad Ashford has changed his mind. The former one-term congressman, now trying to win back an Omaha-area seat he lost in 2016, used to consider it futile to push for a ban while Republicans held power on Capitol Hill. But the student activism that has followed the rampage at a school in Parkland, Florida, has changed his thinking in a way that other high-profile shootings, including two in his hometown since 2007, had not. Ashford's conversion mirrors the one underway in his party. Not long ago, a moderate record on guns would have been considered a plus for a Democratic candidate in the GOP-leaning suburbs and conservative outskirts of Nebraska's largest city. Today, even with Ashford's reversal, it's a vulnerability that his opponent in the May 15 Democratic primary has been quick to exploit. That contest, along with races in Virginia, rural Pennsylvania and other places where gun control has been taboo, shows how far the Democratic Party has traveled on this issue. The November elections will test whether Democrats will make room for candidates who don't back all gun control measures. \"He should have been stronger on this,\" said Kara Eastman, the 46-year-old political newcomer running against Ashford, a 68-year-old former Republican, for the Democratic nomination in the 2nd Congressional District. \"We need leaders who are going to stand up and fight for the kids.\" Eastman, director of a children's nonprofit group and a community college board member, has focused her message on suburban women and young people. She and other progressives, energized by rallies across the country, say they the best way to turn out voters is to offer a contrast to pro-gun Republicans. \"Women have had it with what's going on,\" said Crystal Rhoades, the Douglas County Democratic Party chairwoman who supports Eastman. \"They're mad that they have to worry about sending their kids to school out of fear they'll be murdered.\" Polling shows there's little disagreement among Democrats on the question of stricter gun laws. A poll last month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 69 percent of those surveyed, including 90 percent of Democrats, think gun laws in the U.S. should be tightened. There are political risks. The Omaha district represented by Republican Don Bacon has a healthy number of gun owners, and that could make Eastman's call for comprehensive gun control a problem for her if she advances to the general election. The GOP-leaning district includes a portion of a rural county south of the city where many active duty and retired military personnel from Offutt Air Force Base live. \"I don't think their mindset has changed. If you're pro-gun, you're still pro-gun,\" said Charlene Ligon, the Democratic chairwoman in rural Sarpy County. \"And there are a lot of people with guns around here.\" In a northern Virginia swing district, all six Democrats who hope to challenge the Republican incumbent, Barbara Comstock, want to ban assault rifles and expand background checks for gun buyers. In 2016, Comstock's Democratic opponent endorsed only modest changes. Last month, Democrat Conor Lamb won a special congressional election in southwestern Pennsylvania in which he advocated expanded background checks, a once disqualifying position in a district that Donald Trump won by 20 percentage points in 2016. Lamb stopped short of embracing an assault weapons ban, though Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., has joined the call. And longtime gun advocate Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator from West Virginia, led an unsuccessful effort to expand background checks in 2015. \"It certainly seems to be a realignment of what was viewed as politically expedient,\" said Andrew Patrick of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. \"This is no longer a liability for Democrats.\" While Nebraska's Ashford, advocated some gun control measures during two terms in the state Legislature, he said during a 2016 debate with Bacon, \"I don't think we should ban assault weapons.\" In Washington, Ashford did not join lawmakers from both parties in backing legislation to expand background checks, saying any gun measures would have proved futile in the GOP-controlled House. Nor did he go along with about 150 Democratic co-sponsors on a measure to ban assault rifles after the shooting in San Bernardino, California, in 2015. \"I had no belief that putting a lot of effort in an assault weapons ban would get us anywhere,\" Ashford said in an Associated Press interview. \"I had sort of lost faith in our ability to ever get there.\" The students in Florida and elsewhere who mobilized after the Parkland shooting have changed Ashford's mind. \"The Parkland thing, now I just feel reinvigorated, and I would vote for an assault weapons ban, today,\" he said. Eastman, his primary opponent, is keeping the pressure on. She accuses Ashford of being on both sides of the issue at a time when voters, especially young people and parents, demand action. And she's ready to delivery, saying she supports an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and an automatic waiting period between purchase and delivery. \"I'm talking to voters, they are frustrated with that and are looking for someone who stands by their convictions,\" she said.","articles_date":"9 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2018\/04\/09\/us\/politics\/ap-us-democrats-gun-control.html","articles_title":"Moderate Democrats Reassess Their Position on Guns","candidate_fk":4,"first_name":"Joe","id":193,"issue":6,"last_name":"Manchin","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) At a time of unrelenting political divisiveness, a bipartisan group of senators claimed a rare victory on Monday following the deal  to reopen the government .  Led by centrists Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a group of senators met four times behind closed doors throughout the weekend to forge an alliance that would pressure leaders on both sides to come to an agreement.  Collins and Manchin led a similar effort during the 2013 shutdown and early last week they decided to give it another go as negotiations stalled ahead of the shutdown.  The group started out with 17 senators on Friday and expanded to 25 senators by Monday. \"That's a pretty powerful number of people who are able to make a difference with their votes and their voices,\" Collins told reporters.  In exchange for a vote to end the government shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged his \"intention\" Sunday to hold a debate on immigration legislation after February 8 if a deal wasn't already struck by then. The compromise proposal was very similar to what the bipartisan group had pitched, Collins said.  Not pleased with the word \"intention,\" Democrats were skeptical at first that McConnell would follow through on his promise. Members of the bipartisan group emerged from their Monday meeting urging McConnell to strengthen his commitment. At the same time, members also urged Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to accept that commitment, if made firmer.  McConnell used the term \"intention\" again on Monday but delivered what many Democrats described as a more convincing promise with concrete details. Within a couple of hours, the Senate advanced the proposal with the help of more than two dozen Democrats.  Manchin and Collins immediately held a news conference to praise the group's effort and tout its influence in the process.  \"It was the decisions made by Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer that brought us to this point,\" Collins said. \"But I believe that our group, by giving them specific ideas for how to move forward and because of the size and bipartisan nature of our group, played a very instrumental role in breaking the impasse.\" Also closely involved in the talks was Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who separately helped lead the \"Gang of Six\" bipartisan group that focused specifically on immigration before the government shutdown.  Can the group stay together? Graham said he hopes the Collins-Manchin bipartisan talks will now turn to a number of issues, including disaster relief, the budget and defense spending.\u00a0\"The people who kind of were involved in helping the leaders reopen the government need to stay involved in finding solutions.\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said he was \"proud\" to play a role in the bipartisan group. In a place where trust runs low, he said the group managed to form a degree of trust that helped other rank-and-file members develop trust in Schumer and McConnell.  \"There will always be critics,\" Kaine said, when asked about criticism Democrats faced by agreeing to McConnell's offer. \"We know who's in the White House ... but we're living in a reality. I think this is the most likely path to finding a solution for Dreamers.\"\u00a0 Sen.

Led by centrists Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a group of senators met four times behind closed doors throughout the weekend to forge an alliance that would pressure leaders on both sides to come to an agreement.  Collins and Manchin led a similar effort during the 2013 shutdown and early last week they decided to give it another go as negotiations stalled ahead of the shutdown.  The group started out with 17 senators on Friday and expanded to 25 senators by Monday. \"That's a pretty powerful number of people who are able to make a difference with their votes and their voices,\" Collins told reporters.  In exchange for a vote to end the government shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged his \"intention\" Sunday to hold a debate on immigration legislation after February 8 if a deal wasn't already struck by then. The compromise proposal was very similar to what the bipartisan group had pitched, Collins said.  Not pleased with the word \"intention,\" Democrats were skeptical at first that McConnell would follow through on his promise. Members of the bipartisan group emerged from their Monday meeting urging McConnell to strengthen his commitment. At the same time, members also urged Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to accept that commitment, if made firmer.  McConnell used the term \"intention\" again on Monday but delivered what many Democrats described as a more convincing promise with concrete details. Within a couple of hours, the Senate advanced the proposal with the help of more than two dozen Democrats.  Manchin and Collins immediately held a news conference to praise the group's effort and tout its influence in the process.  \"It was the decisions made by Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer that brought us to this point,\" Collins said. \"But I believe that our group, by giving them specific ideas for how to move forward and because of the size and bipartisan nature of our group, played a very instrumental role in breaking the impasse.\" Also closely involved in the talks was Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who separately helped lead the \"Gang of Six\" bipartisan group that focused specifically on immigration before the government shutdown.  Can the group stay together? Graham said he hopes the Collins-Manchin bipartisan talks will now turn to a number of issues, including disaster relief, the budget and defense spending.\u00a0\"The people who kind of were involved in helping the leaders reopen the government need to stay involved in finding solutions.\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said he was \"proud\" to play a role in the bipartisan group. In a place where trust runs low, he said the group managed to form a degree of trust that helped other rank-and-file members develop trust in Schumer and McConnell.  \"There will always be critics,\" Kaine said, when asked about criticism Democrats faced by agreeing to McConnell's offer. \"We know who's in the White House ... but we're living in a reality. I think this is the most likely path to finding a solution for Dreamers.\"\u00a0 Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, acknowledged the group was \"just getting started\" in terms of broader efforts, but he said the outcome gave him hope that moderates in the Senate can have more sway in the future. \"I think there's a strong sense that we can actually work together,\" he said.

These latest investigations came out the same day that a few thousand more West Virginians were told they could use their tap water again, for the first time in nearly a week. Still, nearly two-thirds of the nearly 300,000 people initially prohibited from using their taps still are waiting for the all-clear. Their headaches and heartaches trace to the leak of several thousand gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol -- a substance used in the coal industry -- from a storage tank belonging to a company called Freedom Industries. That chemical made its way into the Elk River, to a water plant about a mile upstream, then into the water system. Residents of nine counties -- including the one that is home to Charleston, West Virginia's capital and most populated city -- were urged last week not to use their tap water to do anything except flush their toilets. With its strong odor as the telltale sign, officials warned that they couldn't say that the water so many rely on to drink, cook using or wash themselves with was safe. Authorities worked to flush the foul-smelling chemical from the area water system, all while conducting tests that eventually showed it declining.  Chemical spill shines spotlight on loose regulation But it has been only recently some have been told they can use their water, such as the lifting of the \"do not use\" order Tuesday morning for the Southridge\/Southside area near Charleston.  By Tuesday evening, about 114,000 people were advised it was safe for them to run their taps again -- with more than 180,000 remaining in limbo.  And it's not just individual citizens in their homes who have been affected. Without safe water, schools and many businesses such as hotels, restaurants and more decided to close. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's office said schools would remain closed in four counties Wednesday, leaving about 46,000 students at leisure. Amid this widespread pain, a number of local, state and federal authorities have announced they're launching investigations intent on getting to the bottom of what happened and holding people, agencies and companies responsible for the spill and possible issues in the response. Investigators from the Kanawha County Fire Department and the state Department of Environmental Protection were among the first at the scene.  By the next day, U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin announced that his office was also looking into what happened, telling CNN that \"even a negligent release of this kind could be a criminal violation.\" Also on the federal side, Environmental Protection Agency investigators went to the scene as did a team from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board. Plus, two U.S. congressmen --  Reps. Henry A. Waxman and Paul D. Tonko, Democrats from California and New York respectively -- said in a letter Monday they believe the spill may have exposed regulatory gaps in the country's chemical control laws. Two new authorities in the state of West Virginia on Tuesday announced their own investigations.  Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said  in a statement that his office plans \"to get to the bottom of this and ensure that the public knows the truth\" -- including what happened, why and how might it have been prevented. \"We need to make sure this never happens again, and that responsible parties are held accountable,\" Morrisey said of his office's \"unbiased, independent inquiry.\" And Unger, the Democratic state senator from Berkeley,  said the Joint Legislative Oversight Commission on State Water Resources  -- which he co-chairs -- is also digging into the \"unacceptable\" ordeal. Among other things, that legislative body will look into who knew what and when, \"and if no one knew, why not.\" \"There will definitely be a change to the way things have been done in the past,\" Unger said. And it's not just West Virginians who are affected. The Greater Cincinnati Water Works, which serves that Ohio city and parts of four counties in Ohio and Kentucky, will temporarily stop taking water from the Ohio River as a precaution, allowing water that might contain traces of the chemical to pass the city, company spokeswoman Michele Ralston said Tuesday. Two Kentucky water systems -- in Ashland and Russell -- temporarily turned off their valve systems, Dick Brown, a spokesman for the Department for Environmental Protection, told CNN.  The move was strictly a precaution since the Elk River is a tributary to the Kanawha, which feeds into the Ohio River.  The Cincinnati utility is sampling the Ohio River water and so far hasn't detected anything out of the ordinary, Ralston said. The move will not disrupt customers' water supplies because the company has a two-day reserve and a groundwater plant that can provide even more treated water, she said.

Fifty-four percent of Americans say they expect Trump to lose his campaign for re-election, the same number who said Obama would lose the 2012 election at this point in his first term. Only 40% of Americans think Trump will win in 2020, similar to the 44% who said the same for Obama. Republicans overwhelmingly say they expect Trump to win re-election to the White House in 2020 (79% feel that way), while Democrats nearly unanimously say they expect him to lose (87% say so). A majority of independents also expect him to lose. Republicans now are more optimistic about Trump's re-election prospects than Democrats were about Obama (just 69% of Democrats said they expected Obama to win at this point in 2010). Former President Bill Clinton faced even worse expectations in 1995, when only a quarter of Americans expected him to win his second term following deep losses for his party in the 1994 midterm elections. Trump filed re-election paperwork with federal election officials on Inauguration Day in 2017. He  formally announced his re-election bid  in February. Republican presidential primary 2020 Trump holds strong support among his own party's potential voters in a 2020 primary race. Three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 75%, say they think the GOP should re-nominate Trump in 2020. Only one in five, 20%, say the GOP should nominate a different candidate. These numbers are virtually identical to Obama's support among Democrats at this point in his term. But when those who want to see someone else take the party's nomination are asked to name an alternative to Trump, no potential candidate has a clear edge. None of the potential nominees raised by respondents earn more than 1% support; that list includes Vice President Mike Pence, former GOP nominee Mitt Romney, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, television personality Oprah Winfrey and retiring South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy. Speculation about a Republican primary challenge has swirled around some anti-Trump GOP voices like Ohio Gov. John Kasich, outgoing Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who have refused to rule out a run for the White House. Democratic presidential primary 2020 Former Vice President Joe Biden holds the most widespread support when potential Democratic primary voters are asked to rate the chances they would support six possible candidates for the party's 2020 nomination. A broad 84% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they are likely to support a Biden bid for the Democratic nomination, two-thirds of whom say they are \"very likely\" to back his candidacy. Large majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents also say they are likely to support Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (75%) and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (68%). Still, this support is slightly less intense than Biden's: Six in 10 likely Sanders backers say they are \"very likely\" to support him and less than half of Warren's likely supporters say they are \"very likely\" to support her. Both Biden, 75, and Sanders, 76, have not ruled out bids for the White House in 2020. Warren  has said she isn't running . About half of potential Democratic primary voters say they are likely to back California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Roughly one in five say they aren't sure if they'd support those latter three, lesser-known possible candidates. Only two in 10 potential Democratic voters overall say they are \"very likely\" to back Harris and Booker; only one in 10 are \"very likely\" to support Gillibrand. Sanders still has the strongest grip on young voters in the Democratic party: 60% of potential Democratic primary voters under 35 say they are very likely to back Sanders vs. 52% for Biden, 29% for Warren, 18% for Harris, 16% for Booker and 12% for Gillibrand. Among potential Democratic primary voters, racial divisions also play a role. Six in 10 nonwhites, 61%, say they are very likely to back Biden's candidacy vs. 52% of whites who say the same. On the flip side, 39% of whites are very likely to back Warren's bid vs. only 25% of nonwhites. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS March 22-25 among a random national sample of 1,014 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.

Last week, Democrats announced that Rep. Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts  will give the party's response  to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday. Kennedy is also planning to bring  US Army Staff Sgt. Patricia King , a transgender soldier, as his guest.  Washington (CNN) One congressman is a low-key member of a political dynasty who is strategically inserting himself into policy debates and laying out what he thinks Democrats still need to learn. The other is a retired Marine and combat veteran who has tangled with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and has already logged a high-profile trip to Iowa more than three years ahead of the next presidential caucus. Massachusetts Reps. Joe Kennedy III and Seth Moulton take different approaches to their work in Washington. But as Democrats focus on retaking the House next year, these lawmakers in their late 30s are getting a fresh look as potential future leaders in a party where many in the senior ranks are well into their 70s.  \"Both are certainly talented enough to certainly be included in higher office and in greater roles and contributions in the country,\" said Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House.  In interviews with dozens of House Democrats over the past several months, Kennedy and Moulton are both viewed as necessary new voices at a time when the caucus is growing restless. Publicly, their colleagues point to the Massachusetts lawmakers' contributions on national security and health care and say they can connect better with young constituencies. But privately, some House Democrats say Kennedy is going about his next steps in a more methodical and collegial way, traveling to districts to help raise money and awareness on issues. Moulton is viewed by some as more eager to elevate his own profile, appearing regularly on cable outlets and repeatedly criticizing his own leadership. For now, Kennedy and Moulton are thinking a lot about 2018, a year that is starting to show signs of being a potential wave election favoring Democrats. In this time of anti-Trump fervor, they're confident in the prospects of Democrats taking the 24 seats needed to reclaim the House majority for the first time in eight years. But first, they're urging their colleagues to internalize lessons from 2016. In a recent interview after his fall trip to Iowa, Moulton says the message he delivers across the country is simple: Democrats need to turn to a new crop of leaders. \"It's unequivocal, everyplace I go, the one line I can use in a speech that I know will get applause is when I say it's time for a new generation of leadership in our party,\" Moulton said. Kennedy, the great nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, headlined a recent Texas Democratic party dinner heavy on criticism of President Donald Trump, who he said launched an \"all-out assault on America's character.\" But he also used the occasion to level some direct criticism at Democrats who spent time hand wringing after Trump's victory without relearning what he described as a basic lesson about politics. \"Do not underestimate what it means to be able to provide for your family and how deeply it destroys you when you can't,\" he said. Kennedy was in Texas, where his wife grew up, to campaign for another young House Democrat, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who is challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. O'Rourke told him that on a recent campaign trip to a small town, he was told no Democrat had campaigned there for 40 years. Kennedy stressed to CNN that fellow Democrats need to prove they mean it when they say every voice, every vote counts. \"That's how you start to earn people back. You show up.\" He thinks leaders from both parties need to get a \"little bit outside those comfort zones, outside the district and actually try and listen to some of those voices that are coming from places that we don't represent because those voices count too. And I think if you zoom out far enough at that moment you've got an electorate writ large which is really angry at Washington that just isn't listening.\" *** It's rare that a top House Republican leader agrees to sit down to talk to a reporter working on a story about a junior House Democrat. But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has a struck up a close friendship with Kennedy, bonding over early morning workouts in the House gym where they talk about politics and family. The California Republican is sometimes as effusive as Democrats in praising Kennedy.  \"I think he's got more potential than anybody else on the Democrat side of that conference because of the way he carries himself, the homework that he does and his ability to serve,\" McCarthy told CNN recently in an interview in his Capitol office. The No. 2 House GOP leader travels to Massachusetts regularly to raise money for his party, but says when he's \"off the clock,\" he spends time with Kennedy and his wife, Lauren. When Kennedy's wife gave birth to their daughter, Ellie, McCarthy and his wife delivered a stuffed elephant rocker as a gift.  \"So, I jokingly tell Joe Ellie is going to be the first Republican Kennedy,\" McCarthy says, laughing, and proudly recounting how he posed for a picture with her on a visit to the Capitol. Though Kennedy, 37, comes from one of the most prominent families in American politics, his colleagues say you wouldn't know it. Illinois Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos, who invited Kennedy to Chicago last year for a fundraiser, noted a slew of family members who were nationally known figures in the room but says Kennedy is a \"policy scholar\" and \"not a show off.\"  Kennedy is a draw on the fundraising circuit.  He's raised roughly $1.3 million this election cycle so far, according to a source in his political operation, and was tapped to help recruit new challengers, particularly those his age and those weighing a run who also have young families. Hoyer, who served in Congress alongside Kennedy's father Joe and is close to many in the political family, said \"I think his son is as comfortable in his own skin as anybody.\"  McCarthy spoke less about his name and more about his style. \"He's a very worthy adversary. He's smart. He does that homework and what I really admire about him, he can go out and be one of these legislators who can just go get press,\" McCarthy said. \"That's not his way. He really got the legislator quality of where the Kennedys were in the past.\" Before being heavily recruited to run for the seat of retiring Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank, Kennedy worked as a prosecutor. Several colleagues mention he takes a methodical approach to legislation he pushes in Congress. \"He dives in on it. He treats it like a case,\" said Oklahoma Rep. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican who serves with Kennedy on the Energy and Commerce Committee, who has also become a close friend. \"He's this tall, redheaded ugly guy that we just seem to get along from day one,\" Mullin said. \"One thing about Joe: Joe's heart is in the right place. I tell him he voted wrong all the time. He tells me he votes wrong all the time. But I know where his heart is and he truly has a passion to serve. You can see that in him.\" When asked during an interview with CNN about his family's influence on his approach to congressional work, Kennedy slowed down and paused deliberately. \"I am, not surprising, very proud the contributions of many of my family members have done, whether it's made to the country, whether in elected office or otherwise,\" Kennedy said. But then he made clear he's cutting his own path, saying \"I'm also conscious of the fact that if you are in, serve in elective office, that by far the most important thing that you have is your credibility.\" The issue of credibility comes up again when he talks about the task ahead for a party rebuilding after a stunning national defeat in 2016 but is sensing renewed energy heading into the midterms. \"I think what (the 2016) election showed is we've got to do a better job of recognizing that it's not just, it's not just spewing out various policies, even if you might be right on the policy,\" he said. \"You have to have the credibility to be able to talk to someone and say, 'listen, this is why I think this is going to be best, help your family, help your future,' and that is a credibility that has to be earned, not just granted.\" Mullin tells CNN the first serious policy discussion he had with Kennedy when they started together in the House in 2013 was about health care. He remembers how passionate Kennedy became, telling him then that the issue was something his family championed in Congress for 50 years.  And that issue earned Kennedy national attention during the health care debate when he delivered an emotional speech that went viral. During a marathon committee markup on the GOP's Obamacare repeal and replace bill, Kennedy ripped House Speaker Paul Ryan personally. He took issue with the fellow Catholic's interpretation of the scripture and calling the measure an \"act of mercy.\" Kennedy denounced the proposal to repeal and replace Obamcare as an \"act of malice.\" When asked about the role younger members can play, Kennedy won't criticize Pelosi, calling her \"one tough lady and one tough leader.\" And he cautions against pigeon-holing someone because of their age.  \"We have to be disciplined enough not to prejudge because somebody is an older socialist from Vermont, that they can't necessarily speak to the hopes and aspirations of a coal miner, a farmer, a college student, a millennial that loves avocado toast,\" Kennedy said. *** Even before he arrived on Capitol Hill, Moulton was a party renegade. In the 2014 midterms, he challenged Rep. John Tierney, an 18-year veteran backed by Pelosi. He gained national headlines for being the first to oust an incumbent that election cycle, and again in 2016 when he publicly called for Pelosi to step down from leadership to make way for newer Democrats to chart the party's future. He backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan's challenge to Pelosi's status as minority leader. He notes that while Ryan failed in that effort, he still got 63 votes in the secret election. Of those, only Moulton and roughly a dozen others have gone public. Hoyer, who years ago had his own leadership battles with Pelosi, said Moulton's moves remind him of himself. Before he came to Congress, Hoyer was the youngest president of the Maryland state Senate. \"I'm not so old that I can't remember being a Young Turk myself,\" Hoyer told CNN, adding about Moulton, \"he's sees himself as an agent of change.\" Hoyer works closely with Pelosi now. But he praises Moulton as \"very bright, very energetic\" and a top messenger on national security issues. Moulton's military service comes up a lot in an interview in his Longworth office in between votes recently. It's what he says exposed him to people from all walks of life and economic levels, and instilled a desire to continue in public life after his four combat tours in Iraq. \"My battalion motto in the Marines was 'whatever it takes,' and I'm going to do whatever it takes to help win back the House in 2018,\" Moulton told CNN. He was recently tapped, along with California Democratic Rep. Jimmy Panetta and Florida Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy, to head a task force to educate House Democrats about foreign policy and defense issues. \"That's a sign that he wants to be a deep thinker and wants to be a big player. And I think it was smart for him to do something like that,\" Bustos said.   The Illinois Democrat was part of the trio -- along with Moulton and Ryan -- invited to headline the annual \"steak fry\" fundraiser in Iowa in September. She said she values his counsel on defense issues, but acknowledged that his tactics inside the caucus, such as his challenge of Pelosi, have caused some friction.  \"People who talk publicly about leadership and the need for leadership change, that's going to ruffle some feathers,\" Bustos said. While Moulton, 39, may criticize Pelosi, he is doing the same thing she did to propel her stock among her colleagues: Raising big bucks for fellow Democrats as they prep for the next election.   He created his own political operation that recruits and mentors candidates who served in the military or have service backgrounds. He says he saw a hole and decided to take on a veterans' candidate program, and he worked with an outside group, VoteVets, to partner with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to ensure these types of candidates were getting attention. Moulton's colleagues have taken notice of the impressive $600,000 he's raised, plus $300,000 for his own re-election campaign.  He told CNN his goal is to formally recruit and back two dozen veterans through his political group -- the same number Democrats need to win back control of the House. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, who heads the DCCC, praised Moulton for zeroing in on the need to focus on fellow veterans. \"He has brought in a spirit of he's willing to speak up and stand up and say what needs to be said based on what he believes, that is in the best interests of his constituents and the people he is fighting for,\" Lujan said.  Moulton's speech in Iowa earlier this fall didn't hold back on the challenge facing his party. He said while Americans in communities across the country were struggling economically, Democrats were \"in the worst position since the 1920s to do anything about it.\"  He pointed to losses both at the national and local level and used them as evidence of his central theme: \"That means that we've got change to make. That means that we can't just keep doing the same old thing and expect to win again. We've got to get back to our party roots. We've got to get back in touch with those voters that we have lost, because the reality is that a lot of Americans feel left behind -- not just by the Republicans, but by our party, and by our country.\" In his Washington office, Moulton says part of the reason he's helping bring candidates in and support them is because he's worried other Democrats aren't creating the environment to foster more people to get engaged in politics. \"I think there is a lot of chaos right now and that's a sign that there's a leadership vacuum,\" he said. He said he doesn't pretend to have all the answers, but says the focus on veterans is his \"niche.\" While he offers his own take on the kinds of issues and economic message he believes is important he says it's too early to be telling voters what matters in the next election. \"We need to be in listening mode for our party right now as Democrats, not in preaching mode,\" he said. Asked about the congressional Democrats' recent roll out of a message campaign offering voters \"a better deal,\" Moulton again breaks with his own leadership. \"A better deal sounds like we're talking about the same deal that everybody has today and we're just going to make it better,\" he said. \"The economy is changing too fast for that. We need to be talking about the future, that's part of why I'm talking about a new generation of leadership and recruiting all these young people to run for Congress.\" He says he's working with the DCCC and his own effort to flip more red seats in the House, but adds, \"We've got to have a message, we've got to have a vision and it's going to be hard to win if we don't have new leadership.\" Not surprisingly, Lujan, a close ally of Pelosi's, disagrees with Moulton's criticism of the top House Democrat. And he appeared to issue what might be a warning to Moulton about any additional effort to push her out. \"You need to be able to learn to count to get there and I think that is a skill set that more people need to fully appreciate and clearly leader Pelosi has understood the importance of counting, if you will. Not just to get bills passed, but with leadership votes as well,\" Lujan told CNN. Drew Hammill, Pelosi's spokesperson, accused Moulton of grandstanding. \"Leader Pelosi enjoys widespread support in the House Democratic Caucus,\" Hammill told CNN in a statement. \"The few who take potshots in order to get booked on TV are merely a distraction from the goal of retaking the House majority. Leader Pelosi will not be deterred from her mission of winning the House back for the American people.\" Moulton appeared annoyed when pressed on whether he's taken on Pelosi to garner more attention for his own political profile and says he's not getting any blowback from colleagues. \"The number of Pelosi allies who have come to me and told me to back off, that I'm not doing the right thing is exactly zero,\" he says, adding, \"the number of members of the caucus who voted for her, who have checked to see who was listening and then patted me on the back and then said 'keep going Seth, you're doing the right thing' is literally dozens.\" Like Kennedy, Moulton has also collaborated with Republicans in the House. After the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 and injured hundreds, he teamed up with Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo on legislation to ban bump stocks, the accessories that can convert a firearm into an automatic weapon. Even though there was a similar bill offered by top House Democrats, he decided to get behind the version with Curbelo. \"I just think it's the only realistic way to do anything when you are in the minority,\" Moulton said. Oklahoma GOP Rep. Steve Russell, also a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, has traveled overseas with Moulton. Russell told CNN their politics are polar opposite but they share a \"warrior bond.\"  The two created the \"warrior caucus\" a group of roughly 30 House members who served in combat, and try to find military readiness issues to work on together. \"One of the things that I like about Seth is that he is intellectually honest, he won't retreat to a partisan corner as a matter of course,\" Russell said. \"He may not commit to something without further study, but he's willing to engage and dialogue.\"  *** As with any up-and-coming politician, the conversation about Moulton and Kennedy quickly turns to the future.  Moulton made clear he didn't want to talk about any political positions in the years to come. \"I think it's a huge mistake for people in the party to be thinking about 2020,\" he said. \"If we can't figure out how to win in 2018, we're going to be a mess in 2020.\" When asked about taking a run at a top leadership post in the House after the midterms, Moulton says, \"I'm not going to write it off, but it's truly not what I'm thinking about.\"   The former Marine grew noticeably irritated when pressed about prospects for a Senate bid if one of his colleagues retires or runs for another office, or whether his Iowa trip or work on a new book about public service are precursors for a national campaign down the line. He says he was invited to Iowa because the organizers of the annual event were looking for \"people who are trying to breathe new life into the party.\" But he said spent the bulk of his time at the event \"with a Miller Lite in one hand and an open hand to meet more people.\" Meanwhile, former Rep. Patrick Kennedy believes his cousin has the credentials to move up if he decides he wants a career beyond the House. \"There's just no question that if he sticks to doing what he's doing now that every one of the options that have been mentioned that are not only a possibility, but a reality,\" he said. Joe Kennedy shrugs off questions about whether he has designs beyond his current House seat. \"If a Senate seat were to come open, yeah it's something I'd take a look at,\" he said.   But he also says it's not just him who will decide. His family is growing after his wife had a second child just before Christmas.  \"I'm young I've got a young family and it's a great family and as other opportunities come up, I'll take a look at some of those when they do but it's got to be right for my family and for me at the time,\" he said.

The internal memo from Carla L. Provost, acting chief of US Border Patrol, is the third indication that there appears to be no evidence of foul play that led to the mysterious death of US Border Agent Rogelio \"Roger\" Martinez, who was found critically injured near a concrete-lined culvert along with his partner.  Provost's February 8 memo, which was sent to Border Patrol employees, including the rank-and-file agents, lays out the findings of the FBI's investigation up to this point. It also echoes an earlier memo from Kevin McAleenan, acting commissioner of the US Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the border patrol.  \"Currently there is no evidence indicating the presence of other persons or the commission of a crime,\" Provost's memo said.  \"Unfortunately, the investigation up to this point has not revealed exactly what took place prior to the two [border patrol agents] being injured and what might have caused BPA Martinez to fall into the culvert,\" Provost's memo said. Martinez's family has been updated on the investigation, the memo said.  \"The family, as we all do, still has unanswered questions,\" the memo said. Martinez, 36, was patrolling alone near Interstate 10 when he stopped his vehicle about 12 miles east of Van Horn, Texas, on November 18. He died hours later of his injuries after he and his partner, Stephen \"Michael\" Garland, were found hurt near the culvert, a tunnel structure used for water drainage.  The agents were patrolling in separate vehicles and it's unclear why both ended up at the bottom of the culvert, the FBI said.  Last week,  FBI investigators  said they had found no evidence so far of an attack or scuffle in Martinez's death. The FBI said it had interviewed hundreds of people, combed through cellular data and analyzed DNA from the scene.  McAleenan's memo said \"there were no defensive wounds\" on Martinez or his partner and \"there was no third-party blood or DNA evidence from the scene or from the agents' clothing.\" The only footprints at the scene belonged to the agents and first responders, according to McAleenan's memo.  Shortly after the incident, Texas politicians -- including Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz -- described the incident as \"an attack.\" A spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represented the officers, said it was an \"ambush.\" And President Donald Trump said the injured agent had been \"brutally beaten\" as he called again for the construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico. Earlier this month,  a medical examiner in Texas  said Martinez died from blunt injuries to his head, but the manner of his death was \"undetermined.\" Martinez's injuries included fractures to his skull, right jaw, upper ribs and his right collarbone, according to an autopsy report released by the El Paso County Medical Examiner's Office. Chris   Cabrera, the spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, said last week the union disagreed with the findings in McAleenan's memo and the FBI's account. \"Our view hasn't changed. Our view is he was attacked,\" he told CNN then, referring to the FBI's investigation. \"It seems to me that they don't have any leads.\"  CNN's Dave Alsup and Nicole Chavez contributed to this report.

Republican leadership aides told CNN intra-party negotiations over the complex bill are still generating new proposals that are regularly being sent to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office for analysis and that process would continue over the weeklong July 4 recess.     A deal cannot be finalized until that CBO scoring takes place and the Senate parliamentarian reviews the language to ensure it fits the strict reconciliation rules being used to pass the bill without the threat of a filibuster. Aides to McConnell insist the Kentucky Republican never imposed a hard Friday deadline for an agreement although other GOP senators, including the third-ranking Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, spoke about that as a goal. \"I think the goal is, as much as we can, have at least sort of a framework in place by the end of the week that we can send to the Congressional Budget Office to get scoring back, so that when we come back after the Fourth of July break next week, the following week, we can move a bill to the floor, get it up and get to work on it and open up the amendment process and hopefully eventually pass it,\" Thune told PBS on Wednesday. On Thursday, Thune was still holding out a hope a deal could be reached. \"We'll see. I'm the optimist,\" he said. \"I'm glass half full.\"  But the reality is stark policy and ideological differences continue to splinter senate Republicans. Despite numerous meetings this week with wavering Republicans in McConnell's office -- many attended by Vice President Mike Pence and Medicaid administrator Seema Verma -- there was little evidence of actual progress toward narrowing the differences between the right flank of the party and members at its center.  Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, who is concerned about reductions in Medicaid spending, was asked if there's been movement.  \"We still got a long way to go I think. I just was in another meeting. In some ways, we're going around in circles, but I think we're getting close on some elements,\" he said.  Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, advocating a plan to allow insurance companies to offer stripped-down and less expensive plans -- a key goal of conservatives -- emerged from his second meeting in McConnell's office in the last two days subdued but positive.  \"We continue to make steady progress,\" he told reporters.  Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman, who also is concerned about reduced Medicaid funding and who wants additional dollars to fight opioid abuse, credited McConnell for picking up the intensity of the talks and trying hard to reach an agreement.   \"I think our leadership team is trying to address issues now in a more aggressive way, which is the only way you get there,\" he said.  Sen. Dean Heller, an endangered Republican running for re-election in Nevada, was one of the first key voices of opposition to the Senate bill when last Friday he declared he was against its proposed reductions to Medicaid.   Top Republicans lobbied him hard in separate meetings Wednesday and Thursday.  He slipped away from reporters when he left those meeting but CNN caught up with him outside a Senate hearing and asked him what it would take to get him to yes.  \"I'm not going to negotiate with the press here on what it's going to take to get to something favorable for the state of Nevada. But the bottom line is if this bill is not good for the state of Nevada, I'm simply not going to support it,\" he said. \"I want to make sure that these families have health insurance tomorrow, especially our poorer families.\" Talks are expected to continue over the recess even as senators are back in their states. When senators return to Washington, they will have three weeks to try to complete the bill before going on a the much-longer August recess.

John McCain as the Arizona Republican returns to Congress following his first round of treatment for brain cancer. The chairman of the Senate armed services committee, McCain will lead debate on the National Defense Authorization Act, one of the few remaining \"must-pass\" pieces of legislation that would authorize $700 billion in Pentagon spending and set a wide swath of military policy. The measure is expected to be debated on the floor as early as this week, and it will set the pace as one of numerous national security issues Congress will tackle in the fall. There have been major foreign policy developments around the globe since Congress was last in Washington, which is reflected in the double-barreled  briefings scheduled  Wednesday on North Korea and Afghanistan. The full House and Senate will receive separate classified, members-only briefings from Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Joe Dunford and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. The briefings will be the first chance for skeptical lawmakers to question President Donald Trump's plan for Afghanistan, which he laid out in a speech last month. Trump's call for more US troops with greater authority to attack the Taliban and other militant groups was praised by Republicans for committing US forces to winning the war in Afghanistan, but Democrats criticized the President for lacking a strategy and not providing details like the number of US additional troops that would deploy. North Korea's  latest nuclear test  on Sunday will refocus attention in Washington on the threat Pyongyang's nuclear program could pose to US allies -- not to mention the US itself. Trump also stirred up concerns about conflict with North Korea in August when he warned of \"fire and fury\" against Pyongyang if it does not stop threatening the US. After the North's latest missile test that flew over Japan, US B-1B bombers and F-35B fighter jets joined with South Korean F-15 fighter jets in a  joint flyover  of the Korean Peninsula as a show of force. Trump has continued to tout potential military action over diplomacy,  tweeting on Wednesday  that \"talking is not the answer\" for North Korea. His Cabinet, meanwhile, is emphasizing diplomacy. \"We're never out of diplomatic options,\" Mattis said when asked about Trump's tweet. But the following day, Mattis rejected the notion he was at odds with the commander in chief. \"There was nothing contradictory there,\" Mattis told reporters. \"The President made very clear we are not talking to North Korea. ... there was no contradiction at all.\" Some lawmakers have expressed concern that Trump could launch a preemptive military strike against North Korea, but there's  not a lot Congress could do  to tie the President's hands short of explicitly barring military action, which is not likely to be considered. Congress could, however, take steps toward drafting a war authorization for ISIS this fall. Mattis and Tillerson briefed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the issue before the August recess, and the panel's chairman Bob Corker has expressed openness to debating a draft authorization in committee that's authored by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona. But the first item on the Senate's agenda will be the defense authorization bill, which could be the vehicle for a number of contentious debates over military policy. Democrats  are preparing  to try to reverse Trump's proposed ban on with an amendment to the defense bill, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York has been sounding out moderate Republicans to find a provision that they could support. The bill will attract scores of amendments, and party leaders will negotiate what issues will get votes on the Senate floor. The bill would authorize a major boost in military spending, even more than Trump proposed in his budget, but securing the defense increase is no sure thing. Congress is likely to pass a continuing resolution to prevent the government from shutting down on Oct. 1, which will keep funding at the same levels as the current year. After that, there's still no clear path forward on a budget agreement to lift defense spending, and this fall the military is facing the  most budget uncertainty  that it's seen in years. In a Washington Post op-ed  published Friday , McCain urged Congress to return to regular order and find a bipartisan agreement on the defense budget, among other items. \"We all know spending levels for defense and other urgent priorities have been woefully inadequate for years. But we haven't found the will to work together to adjust them,\" McCain wrote. \"A compromise that raises spending caps for both sides' priorities is better than the abject failure that has been our achievement to date.\"","articles_date":"3 9 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/09\/03\/politics\/north-korea-afghanistan-congress-national-security\/index.html","articles_title":"North Korea, Afghanistan top Hill's fall national security agenda","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":201,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"In places such as Murrieta, California, and Oracle, Arizona, the message is clear: Thousands of immigrant children fleeing Central America are unwelcome in Small Town U.S.A. The children, many of them arriving unaccompanied from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have traveled up to 3,000 miles across deserts and rivers, clinging to the tops of trains. They sometimes face rape and beatings at the hands of \"coyotes,\" smugglers who are paid thousands of dollars to sneak them across the southern border with Mexico. Earlier this month in Murrieta, busloads of babies in their mothers' laps, teens, 'tweens and toddlers were turned back from a detainee facility.  They were met by screaming protesters waving and wearing American flags and bearing signs that read such things as \"Return to Sender.\" And so it goes. Southwest border towns, West Coast suburbs, and middle-America enclaves have become the newest battleground in the vitriolic political debate over immigration. The showdowns highlight the scope and depth of challenges the Obama administration grapples with as officials try to use immigration-related fixes to resolve what politicians on both sides of the aisle have called \"a humanitarian crisis.\" Here's a snapshot of how things are playing out across the country: Arizona:  In Oracle, a town of roughly 3,700,  protesters  faced off Tuesday at Sycamore Canyon Academy, a nearby boys ranch that is to be used as a temporary housing facility for the immigrant minors, according to CNN affiliate KOLD. Protesters representing both sides of the debate screamed and waved signs reading such things as \"Send 'em to Coyote Obama,\" according to video from CNN affiliate KPNX. One man trumpeted a Mariachi-version of the  \"Star-Spangled Banner\"  as people around him yelled. Protesters even tried to stop a bus of kids from the local YMCA , which they had mistaken as the immigrant children. But the Central American children never arrived, according to  media reports . Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said accepting the unaccompanied juvenile immigrants only encourages more to come. \"Their very hope was realized when we took them in. Nobody was turned back and what I believe, and I think a lot of Americans would agree, is instead of accepting these 90,000, they should have -- the humanitarian way to address this is reunite them with their families and their country of origin because this 90,000 is going to be hundreds of thousands,\" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo Wednesday. \"These children should be returned to their home country -- not to Oracle, Arizona, paid for by American taxpayers,\" Babeu said earlier in a statement on the department's  Facebook page . California:  In sharp contrast to the   reception similar children received in Murrieta, Central American immigrant children have been welcomed by the community of Fontana.  Just over 40 immigrants on Homeland Security buses arrived at the St. Joseph's Catholic Church there on Thursday and were greeted by staff and community donations of food, clothing and toys, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. And a group of California state lawmakers headed to Central America on Monday to discuss the surge of immigrant children with leaders from that region, according to  CNN affiliate KCRA.   Texas:  Protestors in Waco, Texas, meanwhile, are demanding better conditions for the 250 men from El Salvador being held at the  Jack Harwell Detention Center , according to CNN affiliate KCEN.  And the  League City, Texas , City Council approved a proposal banning the housing or detention of undocumented immigrants within the city at a recent meeting, according to KHOU.  New Mexico:  In Artesia, New Mexico, hundreds of residents turned out for a  contentious town hall  meeting to decry the hundreds of women and children being housed at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, a facility that also trains Border Patrol agents, according to CNN affiliate KOAT. Iowa:  Gov. Terry Branstad  told CNN affiliate WHO  on Monday that he does not want federal officials to send Central American children to his state, adding that by accepting them, the United States is sending \"a signal to send kids illegally.\" Some local aid groups are appalled.  \"My God. This is a humanitarian crisis,\" said Kathleen McQuillen, the Iowa Program Director of American Friends Service Committee.  McQuillen's group, a Quaker-based organization, questions how the country could spend trillions on war and not have the pennies on those dollars to spend to take care of children in dire need. She said, \"It's a simple thing to begin to say, what's important in this world?\" Nebraska:  At a National Governors Association meeting in Nashville earlier this month, Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman complained that federal officials did not notify him that they were placing hundreds of immigrant children with family members in his state. Michigan:  Protesters headed to city hall in Vassar earlier this month to oppose a social service agency's plan to temporarily house 60 immigrant children according to CNN affiliate  WNEM .   \"It's about the American government, Democrat or Republican, getting off their lazy butts and passing a decent bill where we can screen our immigrants, make sure they're not felons, diseased or whatever, and get a program set up to bring them into this country,\" Vassar resident Jack Smith told WNEM. Virginia:  Federal officials shelved plans to send the children to an unoccupied, historically black college campus in Lawrenceville, a small community of about 1,400, after nearly the entire town showed up at a meeting and furiously denounced the proposal. \"Our staff will immediately cease any further activities in your community,\" Mark Greenberg,  the Department of Health and Human Services acting assistant secretary for children and families,  wrote the community in June. Prince William County officials were frustrated to learn second-hand that some children are being housed in shelters in the region. \"HHS did not inform the county. We're somewhat upset about that,\" Prince William County Board of Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart told CNN affiliate  WJLA . \"I'm concerned these children may be housed here permanently and of course there is going to be a drain on our educational system and other county services.\"  Maryland:  Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley told CNN in an interview that he asked the White House to not send the minor immigrants to a site in western Maryland that was under consideration. \"What I said was that would not be the most inviting site in Maryland. There are already hundreds of kids already located throughout Maryland,\" O'Malley said. The plan was scuttled. O'Malley officials pointed to graffiti that was found spray painted on the shelter site in Westminster, Maryland, last weekend as an indication of hostility the migrant housing plan was generating.  \"No illeagles here. No undocumented Democrats,\" the graffiti read.  A Maryland law enforcement official told the Washington Post the message would be investigated as a hate crime. Washington:  Roughly 600 unaccompanied immigrant children from Central America may soon be heading to Joint Base Lewis-McChord south of Tacoma, according to CNN affiliate  KING.   Representatives with HHS are slated to meet Wednesday with Lakewood city leaders and staffers from the office of Democratic Rep. Denny Heck to discuss the matter. \"The biggest concern we have here in DuPont is the security,\" DuPont City Administrator Ted Danek told the station. \"You've got a lot of people coming here (with) no known backgrounds.\" And on Monday, the U.S. government deported the first group of what authorities promise will be many more -- about 40 mothers and children. They flew to Honduras on a charter flight. Despite the perils of their journey to the United States and their failed attempt to stay, one woman plans to make the trek again. There is nothing left for them at home, she said.","articles_date":"16 7 2014","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2014\/07\/15\/politics\/immigration-not-in-my-backyard\/index.html","articles_title":"Not in my backyard: Communities protest surge of immigrant kids","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":202,"issue":2,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Who is the Republican candidate whose victory will expand the House majority to 245 members? ADVERTISEMENT Speaker John Boehner and House Republicans are looking beyond holding their majority on Election Day. They are aiming to get to 245 members, which would be the largest Republican majority since the end of World War II. Currently, Republicans hold 233 seats to the Democrats\u2019 199. There are three vacancies. House Republicans are not alone in their belief that there will be notably fewer Democrats in the 114th Congress. Famed political prognosticator Charlie Cook sees Republicans holding as many as 248 seats, while his esteemed counterpart Stu Rothenberg projects the high mark for Republicans will be as many as 245. [pullquote] To achieve success, Republicans will need to win in all three of these categories:\u00a0 1. Open seats currently held by a Republican in Republican territory.\u00a0 2. Seats currently held by a Democrat in Republican territory.\u00a0 3. Seats currently held by a Democrat in swing territory. As results on the East Coast should be known early, here are three races to watch to gauge the potential for Republicans to reach 245 seats in the House by the end of the evening.  With the retirement of Rep. Frank Wolf, Republicans must hold this sprawling Northern Virginia district, which he has represented since 1981. Republican State Delegate Barbara Comstock faces Democrat Fairfax County Supervisor John Foust. As evidenced by Republicans winning this congressional district by a mere 1 percent in last year\u2019s gubernatorial election, it has become increasingly competitive. With her repeated elections to the state House, Comstock has shown an ability to win in the more challenging areas of the congressional district for Republicans. She will easily hold this seat if she continues to do well with voters in her current state legislative district and scores big victories in the traditionally Republican strongholds in the western counties and cities in the district. This race represents a Republican pickup opportunity. Republican presidential nominees have won the district recently, while Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall continues to hold on. State Sen. Evan Jenkins offers Republicans the most credible nominee the party has had since the mid-\u201990s. In a race that will see as much advertising by third-party organizations as any House race in the country, the winner will be the candidate who voters believe will do the most to take on President Obama\u2019s War on Coal and the EPA.  Election outcomes in this district have mirrored the national environment lately as much as any congressional district in the country. In a year favoring Republicans, this provides a welcome advantage for State Rep. Marilinda Garcia, who is challenging the Democratic incumbent, Rep. Ann Kuster. Through her work in the New Hampshire House, Garcia has advocated against ObamaCare and championed alternative ideas to improve access to and quality in health care.\u00a0 Conversely, Kuster has said she would vote for ObamaCare again if she had the chance. If the political impact of ObamaCare is enough to decide an election, it will happen in this district. By winning these three races, the question throughout the night will increasingly become which Republican candidate\u2019s victory expands the majority to 245 seats. Who do you think it will be?","articles_date":"01 10 2014","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/2014\/10\/01\/november-midterms-who-will-be-245th-house-republican.html","articles_title":"November midterms: Who will be the 245th House Republican?","candidate_fk":3,"first_name":"Evan","id":203,"issue":8,"last_name":"Jenkins","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Tom Perriello, a former Virginia congressman and an ex-diplomat in the Obama administration, is set to shake up the Democratic primary in the highly anticipated 2017 Virginia gubernatorial race. A Democratic source with knowledge of Periello's plans confirmed them to CNN. A second senior Democratic source said Perriello has informed Lt. Governor Ralph Northam, up until now the only announced candidate, of his intention to run.  The New York Times    first reported  Perriello's plans, and official announcement could come as soon as Thursday. Perriello himself did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Perriello confirmed his bid Thursday morning, tweeting: \"I'm running for Governor. VA will remain the firewall vs Trump- our values worth defending: http:\/\/tomforvirginia.com.\" Perriello's plans complicate the Democrats' strategy in Virginia, a state with likely the most important political contest in 2017. Only two states, Virginia and New Jersey, will hold governor's races this year and the results are often viewed as a way to judge voters' impressions of the newly elected presidential administration.  Democrats had thought they had avoided an ugly primary battle when the state's popular attorney general, Mark Herring, chose to run for re-election instead of challenging Northam in a primary.  Perriello's entry creates an interesting dynamic. He served one term in the conservative, sprawling 5th District of Central Virginia before being swept out of office in the tea party wave of 2010. His two years were spent balancing his liberal politics with the conservative sensibilities of the largely rural district, which does include the progressive enclave of Charlottesville.  He sided with conservatives on key issues such as guns (he once received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association) and abortion (he cast a ballot in favor the Stupak amendment which prevents federal funds from being used to pay for abortions). But Perriello ended his 2010 campaign in a liberal flourish, even bringing President Barack Obama to the district for a dramatic rally in the closing days of the campaign. He lost by 4 percentage points.  Perriello is viewed as a progressive champion among Virginia Democrats, while Northam is viewed as a more traditional, moderate Virginia Democrat. Born and raised in the state's Eastern Shore, Northam was a prep school baseball star before attending the famed Virginia Military Institute and then eventually becoming a pediatric neurosurgeon. He also served in the Virginia Senate and was known for his ability to work with both sides, but had a reliably liberal voting record, especially when it came to abortion rights.  Meanwhile, Perriello has spent his years out of public office working for a liberal think tank in Washington before accepting an assignment as the Obama administration's Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa.  Both men have relatively low profiles when it comes to statewide Virginia politics, but Northam certainly starts the race with an enormous head start. He has already raised millions of dollars and has spent the last year criss-crossing the state as the presumptive Democratic nominee.  He also still enjoys the support of most of Virginia's prominent Democrats including both senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, and Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Aides to the two senators and the governor confirmed to CNN they will stick with the Northam regardless of Perriello's entry into the race.   This new development could be good news for Virginia Republicans, who are already anticipating their own bruising primary. Their contest could be the first major inter-party battle for the GOP since Donald Trump's surprise win in the race for president.  Former George W. Bush aide Ed Gillespie is considered the frontrunner, but he is facing a feisty challenge from a slew of candidates including, Corey Stewart the former Virginia Campaign Chairman for Trump, State Sen. Frank Wagner and businessman Dallas Riggleman.   Virginia hold its primary -- which is open to all voters -- on June 13.

Meanwhile, Perriello has spent his years out of public office working for a liberal think tank in Washington before accepting an assignment as the Obama administration's Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa.  Both men have relatively low profiles when it comes to statewide Virginia politics, but Northam certainly starts the race with an enormous head start. He has already raised millions of dollars and has spent the last year criss-crossing the state as the presumptive Democratic nominee.  He also still enjoys the support of most of Virginia's prominent Democrats including both senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, and Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Aides to the two senators and the governor confirmed to CNN they will stick with the Northam regardless of Perriello's entry into the race.   This new development could be good news for Virginia Republicans, who are already anticipating their own bruising primary. Their contest could be the first major inter-party battle for the GOP since Donald Trump's surprise win in the race for president.  Former George W. Bush aide Ed Gillespie is considered the frontrunner, but he is facing a feisty challenge from a slew of candidates including, Corey Stewart the former Virginia Campaign Chairman for Trump, State Sen. Frank Wagner and businessman Dallas Riggleman.   Virginia hold its primary -- which is open to all voters -- on June 13.

Senators are likely to have only a handful of days to decide whether to support or vote against the 142-page bill, which was unveiled on Thursday. In his statement, Obama said the Senate bill is \"not a health care bill.\" \"It's a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America,\" he wrote. \"It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else. Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again. Millions of families will lose coverage entirely.\" The former President argued that he fought for the ACA \"for more than a year\" alongside \"thousands upon thousands of Americans\" because \"we knew it would save lives, prevent financial misery, and ultimately set this country we love on a better, healthier course.\" He ended his Facebook post encouraging the public to call members of Congress, visit their offices, speak out and \"let them and the country know, in very real terms, what this means for you and your family.\" \"After all, this debate has always been about something bigger than politics,\" he wrote. \"It's about the character of our country -- who we are, and who we aspire to be. And that's always worth fighting for.\" The Senate bill is similar to the version of the House measure that passed last month. Trump has since called it \"mean,\" despite celebrating it at the Rose Garden with House Republicans.  Democrats have blasted the Senate bill, with some  calling it \"meaner.\" Four conservative Republican senators -- Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson and Mike Lee -- said they opposed the current version.

Obama indicated before leaving the White House last fall that his short-term, post-presidency focus will be on General Assembly races and redistricting after the 2020 Census. And 2016 presidential candidate former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley has become the most recent high-profile Democrat to take up the cause. \u201cAmerica needs non-partisan redistricting commissions,\u201d O\u2019Malley said at Boston College Law School, where he\u2019s now a visiting professor. \u201cThis simple reform \u2026 must become the new norm of American democracy. \u2026 How can we expect people to vote if their voice has been carved into irrelevance by a political map ahead of time?\u201d An early test for Democrats trying to win state-level races and stopping the Trump wave arrives this weekend. Delaware is holding a special election for an open state Senate seat that will decided whether Democrats keep their roughly 40-year hold on the chamber. \"If we lose, a new Republican majority will take power and rubber-stamp every single one of Trump's hateful policies,\" the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee said in a recent fundraising letter. \"They'll grind all our progress to a halt.\" Voting districts are redrawn after a federal Census to reflect the changes in population and other demographic. Much of the redistricting across the country is done by the political party that controls the state legislature. However, critics argue the process, known as gerrymandering, has run amok, with the majority party drawing districts in crazy-quilt patterns to help protect incumbents and their party win more races. \u201cThere\u2019s one district in Virginia where you have to take a boat on the James River to get to another part,\u201d Jared Leopold, spokesman for the Democratic National Redistricting Committee, told Fox News. The tax-exempt group is leading Washington Democrats\u2019 major effort to erase the majorities Republicans have in Congress and statehouses across the country. The Republicans wave election of 2010 handed them the House majority and control of 20 additional state House and Senate chambers, giving the party broad authority in redrawing district maps after the Census that year. Twenty-three legislatures are primarily responsible for that task. And the situation has only helped Republicans retain their seats and add to 2010 gains. Leopold cited three main objectives: help Democrats win more races in the next few election cycles to \u201cput them in a better situation before redistricting in 2020,\u201d embark on legal efforts to \u201cundo some of the more egregious redistricting\u201d after the 2010 Census and push ballot initiatives that will lead to \u201cfair maps.\u201d He described the NDRC as a \u201csuper group\u201d that brings together the efforts of the Democratic Governors Association, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee and House Majority PAC. The group\u2019s chairman is former Attorney General Eric Holder, whose support, along with Obama\u2019s, will give the group bonda fides and fundraising clout. \"We heard a lot in this past election about rigged systems,\u201d Holder said last month in announcing the group\u2019s start. \u201cBut I want to say the biggest rigged system in America is gerrymandering.\u201d However, the group is not championing non-partisan redistricting commissions, as O'Malley and others are.\u00a0 O\u2019Malley, who is continuing efforts to lead the party\u2019s progressive wing, has also made clear that his call to end gerrymander speaks directly to what he fears is a rising, anti-immigrant sentiment and other policies associated with Republican President Trump. \u201cI want to speak with you today about the immediate challenges facing our nation,\u201d said O\u2019Malley, who also equates Trump\u2019s beliefs and polices to fascism. \u201cWe must frame a principled opposition to Trump-ism.\u201d Beyond the Delaware contest, the real bellwether races will start next year in Virginia, North Carolina and New Jersey. Virginia, a battleground state that has voted Democrat the past three presidential elections, next year is having state House races and a gubernatorial contest to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe. The governor\u2019s race already has heavyweights from both parties including Democratic Rep. Tom Perriello. The Republican slate includes Corey Stewart, an immigration hawk and former Trump campaigner, and Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who nearly upset Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in 2014. Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee spokeswoman Carolyn Fiddler told Fox News that the Democrats\u2019 recent efforts are a \u201csmart refocus of efforts,\u201d more than a reckoning and that related fundraising has been \u201castronomical.\u201d She also said Trump\u2019s victory has indeed sparked a lot of interest -- from potential canvassers to candidates. \u201cBut it has also crystalized some social and political priorities for people in ways they had not before.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0","articles_date":"25 02 2017","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2017\/02\/25\/obama-democratic-super-group-unite-to-end-gerrymandering-win-state-races-reclaim-majorities.html","articles_title":"Obama, Democratic 'super group' unite to end gerrymandering, win state races, reclaim majorities","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":207,"issue":8,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat on the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, had just finished his train commute from Delaware to Washington on Tuesday morning when he learned the news. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  had been fired . \"I turned to (my staffer) and I said, 'Please just tell me it's going to be a calm day, nothing much going on. I've got a very full plate. I just need an ordinary day,' \" Coons recounted. The staffer looked at Coons and asked if the senator was cracking a joke. Then he told Coons, \"The President just fired the secretary of state in a tweet.\" Even in Washington, which has become acclimated to a rigorous pace of news dominated with presidential tweets, staff shake-ups and quickly evolving storylines, President Donald Trump's announcing his decision Tuesday took members of Congress (as it did Tillerson)  by surprise . Across Capitol Hill, aides and members were scrambling to figure out what had just happened, with many learning the news from reporters clamoring the halls for answers. Members -- even those on relevant committees -- lamented they'd been given no warning that the firing was imminent. \"Well, I mean the way that this all happened obviously is a concern,\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican. \"To find out you've been fired by tweet is not exactly reassuring in terms of the conduct of government.\" The chairman of the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, learned Tillerson was leaving from news reports and didn't get a call from Trump until 9:58 a.m. ET, more than an hour after the news had broken. \"I heard about it like so many things,\" Corker said, looking at a group of reporters peppering him with questions. \"I heard about it from y'all.\" Compounding the feeling of volatility on the Hill was the fact that just hours after Tillerson was let go, Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy Steve Goldstein , a top aide, was also fired . Tillerson's firing had a real and immediate impact on the GOP's agenda in Congress. The Senate -- already swamped with a banking bill, sex trafficking legislation and an upcoming federal spending deal -- learned Tuesday that it would now have to devote significant floor time not only to confirming Tillerson's replacement, who Trump named as CIA Director Mike Pompeo, but also to confirming a new CIA director to replace Pompeo. \"With everything else we have to do around here, having the prospect of two additional confirmation fights perhaps is going to be a challenge,\" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip and second ranking Republican in the chamber, told reporters. But while the timing of Tillerson's ouster caught Capitol Hill off guard, the fact it happened did not. \"I don't think this shocked a lot of people,\" Sen. Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, told CNN. \"This has been going on since before around Thanksgiving. I think people thought ... not if, but when.\" Still, lawmakers said, the firing had come at a pivotal time for US foreign policy, just as Trump had announced last week that  he would meet with North Korea's leader  and as the President had just  announced new tariffs on imported aluminum and steel . If members had once seen Tillerson as a steadying force in the White House, that channel had just evaporated. And it came just a week after Gary Cohn, whom  members described as another voice of reason in the administration , had  quit his post as a top economic adviser . \"The last thing we need at this time in the world is the chaos the administration has created,\" said Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. \"He's running our country more like a reality TV show than the most influential and powerful country on Earth,\" said Coons. For months, Tillerson and Trump have not seen eye to eye, a fact several members of Congress have been privy to. After news broke that  Tillerson had called Trump \"a moron\" last year , the President's frustration with his secretary of state never ceased to hinder their relationship. Trump and Tillerson disagreed on a whole host of foreign policy issues, from Iran to North Korea to the Paris climate deal. Adding to the tension was a simple distinction in how both men approached their jobs. Corker described Trump as \"entrepreneurial\" in his approach to foreign policy, while Tillerson -- who came from a job as CEO at Exxon Mobil -- had tended to be more \"process oriented.\" \"There were just differences in style,\" Corker remarked. \"I don't share conversations, but I have a close enough relationship with both of them to understand very well the relationship.\" \"It was not a long-term tenable situation to have ongoing tension and conflicts between the President and secretary of state,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, told CNN. Members acknowledged Tuesday that Tillerson may not be the last Cabinet member shake-up. Trump said Tuesday that he was \"close\" to having the Cabinet he wanted, an allusion that more news could be coming. Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said the GOP had discussed Tillerson's firing at lunch and added that \"the vice president thanked Secretary Tillerson for his service to America. We all joined in that.\" \"Every president has his own management style, including President Trump. It's not a criticism, it's just a fact. As we say in Louisiana, President Trump is a hard dog to keep on the porch. He's not a porch dog, he's a running dog, and likes to do things his way,\" Kennedy said. Responding to the President's statement that he almost has the Cabinet he wants, Kennedy smiled, and said, \"That means he's got a little more running to do, maybe.\" CNN's Ted Barrett, Manu Raju, Phil Mattingly, Sunlen Serfaty, Daniella Diaz and Liz Turrell contributed to this report.","articles_date":"13 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/13\/politics\/foreign-policy-congress-tillerson\/index.html","articles_title":"On Capitol Hill, a day of chaos follows Tillerson firing: 'I heard about it from y'all'","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":208,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Congressional Democrats are eying unlikely bedfellow President Donald Trump as a potential game changer in the push to combat gun violence, pointing to some of his past statements in favor of gun control and his recent deal-making with Democrats.

While Trump's rhetoric was fiercely pro-Second Amendment on the campaign trail, and while his sons are known as avid hunters, some senators emerged from the meeting pointing to mixed signals he's given on gun control in the past. In December 2012, Trump praised then-President Obama for his speech in Newtown, Connecticut, after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In that speech, Obama pledged to work toward change to combat gun violence, saying society wasn't doing enough and signaled he would push for both gun control measures and mental health laws. While Trump wasn't specific about what he liked in Obama's speech, he  tweeted  that \"President Obama spoke for me and every American in his remarks.\" Asked by someone on Twitter in 2013 for his take on gun control,  Trump responded , \"Big Second Amendment believer but background checks to weed out the sicko's are fine.\" He also said in his 2000 book that  he supported the 1994 assault weapons ban that was not renewed in 2004.   In his presidential campaign, however, Trump offered a different view, saying in a policy paper that \"gun and magazine bans are a total failure.\" Though Democrats are doubtful that Trump will side with them on the issue, they're not ruling him out -- or at least a messaging strategy to put the ball in his court.   \"If he is true to what he has said earlier, he could be a huge ally,\" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia. \"That he once favored it gives me hope that maybe somewhere down the line he'd be in favor of that again,\" said Sen.

Asked at a news conference if Trump was the only factor that could end the gun standoff, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he's \"the most logical\" choice.

Within hours of the Senate majority leader unveiling a  long-anticipated health care bill  on Thursday, four of his Republican colleagues were quick to put a damper on things: \"We are not ready to vote for this bill,\" the group said in a joint statement.  The swift rejection may be a negotiating ploy, but the public nature of it is a reminder for McConnell of the deep reservations running through his own conference on a proposal that conservatives do not believe goes far enough to repeal Obamacare -- and the monumental challenge that lies ahead as he looks for 50 \"yes\" votes.  RELATED: What's inside the Senate Republican health care bill Over the next few days, McConnell needs to determine what concessions he can make to sway at least two of the four conservative senators -- but do so without losing support from the more moderate wing of the Senate, some of whom face tough re-elections next year. Sen. Ted Cruz, who along with Sens. Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson said they could not support the bill in its current form, told reporters Thursday afternoon that the real negotiations have only just begun -- and suggested he would be willing to swallow elements he doesn't care for.  \"Everyone's going to have to give. That's the only way you can get at least 50 out of 52 Republicans,\" Cruz said. \"We have a very narrow majority.\" The White House is preparing for a roller coaster week until a vote. \"It's going to be rocky next week, like you saw with the House bill,\" a senior White House official said, comparing the ongoing negotiations to a game of \"whack-a-mole\" -- a reference to the challenge of balancing any changes that win over one group while risking losing another. But McConnell doesn't have much time.  He is aiming for a vote before members leave town ahead of the July 4 recess, giving Senate Republicans have just a handful of days to study a 142-page bill. And they will have even less time to consider the Congressional Budget Office's score of the bill -- and dramatic headlines of what it means for Americans' health care coverage -- once it's released early next week. Many of McConnell's colleagues, however, are confident that if anyone can find 50 votes, it's their majority leader -- a political tactician who knows Senate procedure inside and out. \"Listen, I think Mitch's role is to choose to take a vote on this. I think that's what he's doing he's gone through a very exhaustive process of the input, and he's come up with a blue print that can still be amended and probably will be in reconciliation,\" said North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr. \"If anyone can get this done, it's him,\" South Dakota Sen. John Thune said. RELATED: Senate math: Republicans have very little margin for error on health care The difficult votes to win On both the moderate and conservative sides of the party, some of the lawmakers that may be the toughest for McConnell to get to a yes are the same ones who may have to rely on his generosity for their re-elections. Sen. Dean Heller, a Nevada moderate, is facing re-election in a swing state that expanded Medicaid. On Thursday, he was among the first to release a statement raising \"serious concerns about the bill's impact on the Nevadans who depend on Medicaid.\" Cruz, a conservative from deep-red Texas who is also up for re-election in 2018, also said that the bill didn't go far enough to lower premiums. But in both cases, McConnell has leverage. Cruz, for example, could face a primary challenge and would be well served to stay in the good graces of McConnell. Heller similarly will have to rely on national party support to help him win in Nevada, where former Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid helped build an extensive political infrastructure. Also aiding McConnell is the fact that Republicans have campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for more than seven years. If they vote against a repeal bill now, they will be charged with not fulfilling their years-long promise back home.  Not to mention senators may have to face the ire of President Donald Trump if they vote against the bill. According to one GOP aide, Trump already made a call to Paul, and asked him personally to support the Senate bill days before its release.   The White House official said it's part of the process for members to raise concerns, but said, \"Hopefully they will conclude that this [bill] is better than the current system\" and support it. The overarching argument from the White House's point of view has been that this is members' best chance to keep their campaign promises to repeal Obamacare. And if the bill fails, would Trump blame McConnell? \"We're not looking to play the blame game. We're all in this together,\" this official said. Working in secret For weeks, McConnell's colleagues have publicly criticized his decision to write the bill behind closed doors. On Thursday, lawmakers reiterated those concerns, wondering out loud whether one week was enough to properly debate the contents of a bill aimed at overhauling the current health care system. \"It's going to be very difficult because it is a complex bill and there are a lot of differing points of view on it too, which is the real problem,\" GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch told CNN. McConnell's dilemma is similar to what House Speaker Paul Ryan faced earlier this year when he struggled to get enough votes to get the House Republican bill through the lower chamber. In fact, the first time that Ryan brought up the legislation in March, it was premature, forcing him to  yank the bill from the House floor  before regrouping to pass it last month. \"Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains,\" Ryan said at the time. \"And well, we're feeling those growing pains today.\" CNN's Athena Jones contributed to this report.","articles_date":"23 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/23\/politics\/mitch-mcconnell-health-care\/index.html","articles_title":"One week. 52 senators.

While the Wisconsin Republican argued Republicans need to focus on their legislative track record in Congress and avoid being outraised, he still said he doubts this will become a trend in Republican-leaning districts because there wasn't a primary. Lamb ran as a moderate eager to work across party lines. He said he supports abortion rights but personally opposes abortion -- a position that matches Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee. And he called for expanded background checks but opposed other new gun restrictions.  But he also campaigned on a pro-union platform. He toed the Democratic line on health care, aired advertisements opposing Ryan-backed reforms to Medicare and Social Security, and hammered the Republican tax bill, arguing it would balloon the deficit and lead to cuts to entitlement programs.

Rand Paul suffered  a painful rib injury  when he was allegedly assaulted by a neighbor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked what a potentially prolonged Paul absence could mean for the GOP agenda.   Heartburn, McConnell replied. \"Every day is a Maalox moment anyway,\" McConnell, who like Paul is also from Kentucky, told reporters in Louisville Monday. \"Any time we have a senator on our side who's not there it, it's potentially a challenge. I got a 52-to-48 majority and um, as you saw on several occasions, we're not always totally in lockstep.\" While many of the gory details of what exactly prompted Paul's neighbor, Dr. Rene Boucher, to allegedly assault the Republican senator -- and exactly how five of his ribs were broken -- are unknown, authorities and Boucher's lawyer say it was prompted by a trivial, long simmering, and  now very public and embarrassing dispute over yard waste . For now, it doesn't appear Republicans will lose any roll call votes because of Paul's convalescence at his home in a gated community in Bowling Green.   The Senate this week is voting to break Democratic filibusters and confirm four of President Donald Trump's executive branch nominees and only 51 votes are needed to do that. All the other GOP senators are here to see that through. Paul's absence did require two votes scheduled for Monday evening to be postponed until Tuesday because Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who was dealing with aftermath of the church shooting in Texas, was also away. But votes on tax reform, government funding, perhaps immigration and other controversial legislation is expected in the next few weeks.  With several veteran GOP senators dealing with illnesses -- including John McCain of Arizona, Thad Cochran of Mississippi and Johnny Isakson of Georgia -- every vote is critical for GOP leaders. That helps explain why McConnell looked relieved Tuesday when he announced to reporters he had spoken to Paul and expects him \"back in the saddle\" next week. \"It was quite an experience. He was literally, as you've read, or may have reported, slammed into by a neighbor,\" McConnell said. \"And he has five either broken or cracked ribs. And said it really hurt and but he's on mend. We expect him back next week, and back in the saddle.\" McConnell had reason to believe Paul might be out for an extended period, based on an ominous statement Sunday from Doug Stafford, an aide to Paul. \"Displaced rib fractures can lead to life-threatening injuries such as: hemopneumothorax, pneumothorax, pneumonia, internal bleeding, laceration of internal organs and lung contusions,\" Stafford said. The biggest upcoming legislative item is tax reform. The first key floor vote is expected the week after Thanksgiving.  While Paul, who is concerned about the bill's impact on the deficit, has yet to say he will for the bill, he has gotten outsized attention from the President on the issue in hopes of getting him to \"yes.\"  Several other GOP senators are considered wavering on the issue so every vote is expected to count for McConnell and other Republican leaders. That maybe why Majority Whip John Cornyn, who oversees corralling votes, sent Paul a text message Monday to check in on him. \"I sent him a text, boy!\" Cornyn exclaimed. \"It seems like he's pretty sore. We wish him and a speedy recovery.\"","articles_date":"7 11 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/11\/07\/politics\/rand-paul-return-mitch-mcconnell\/index.html","articles_title":"Paul's expected return soothes heartburn for McConnell","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":213,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Greisa Martinez Rosas would qualify for the Dream Act and serves as the Advocacy Director of United We Dream, the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the country. The opinions expressed this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN) This week, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke in Congress for eight hours straight about immigrant youth. She shared our stories and called for passage of the Dream Act. Yet, while she was speaking, Democratic and Republican party leaders  were writing a budget deal  that would leave protections for immigrant youth out in exchange for dollars on other projects.  Our lives \u2014 and the moral compass of this country \u2014 are in real danger and yet Congress is playing games with both. Speeches, empty promises and crocodile tears will not protect me or my sisters from deportation agents. Only votes from Congress can do that. At a CNN town hall one year ago, House Speaker  Paul Ryan told my friend Angelica  that she would be safe, yet we now live in danger of being picked up and taken to detention centers by Donald Trump's Immigration and Customs Enforcement squads.  We are tired of speeches, tweets and promises that are not followed by solutions. This is especially true for Democrats and moderate Republicans who say that they support us when the cameras are rolling but repeatedly cave to Trump's bullying. Earlier this week, the Senate's Democratic Leader, Chuck Schumer,  crafted a deal  that, cruelly, will do nothing to stop the pain and the deportations.  And Thursday night, Nancy Pelosi failed to whip her caucus to use its leverage to protect us, as 73 Democrats voted with Republicans for the budget deal and secured nothing from Paul Ryan.  In this leadership moment, where they had their opportunity to fight back against Trump's racist policies,  the Democrats stood down  and the deportations continue to escalate.  They did this over the wishes of the American people. Polls consistently show voters across the political spectrum supporting citizenship for immigrant youth over the Trump administration's vision of mass deportation. Immigrant youth and our allies in cities, towns, and states across the country have generated bipartisan, broad and deep support for passage of the Dream Act in Congress. We have created the political and moral conditions for Congress to use its leverage to protect the lives of immigrant youth and stand up to Trump. The world now must wonder if there exists in Congress a resistance to Trump's unpopular vision.  As ICE and Border Patrol agents board buses and trains to ask citizens and non-citizens alike for their papers, as children are dragged to detention camps and thousands of immigrant youth lose their jobs and become vulnerable, one has to wonder what it will take. The stakes are incredibly high. Millions of us have no protection from deportation at all and those who are now protected are becoming increasingly vulnerable. Since Trump announced last fall that he was ending the DACA program,  more than 19,000 immigrant youth  have lost their protections from deportation, 850 more lose it every week and on March 5, Trump has decided that it will end for all of us.  Nearly every day, I hear of another friend who loses protection. While Trump's top immigration  agent announced last June that we undocumented immigrants \"need to be worried,\"  and that no undocumented person would be off the table, young immigrants have continued to hear from politicians of every stripe (even Trump!) that this is our home and that they love us. Yet they continue to play cruel games with our lives.  Trump is killing DACA, putting me at risk, and now says he will only protect me if the country buys his plans to deport our families and end family immigration for all. It is blackmail \u2014 pure and simple. Those who claim to stand in the way of Trump's racist policies give us only speeches. Just weeks ago at the Women's March, I watched former Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine speak of his admiration for immigrant youth to great applause. The women there chanted \"Dream Act Now\" but just days, later,  Kaine voted to give up the fight to protect us .  Immigrant youth, people of color, faith leaders, women and millions of allies are putting our bodies on the line every day to resist Trump and fight for a better and fairer country. Leader Pelosi, House Democrats and the Republicans who say they stand with immigrant youth and the promise of Lady Liberty have a decision to make. Will they use their leverage to save the lives of immigrants or will they continue to enable our abuser?

The Republican and Democratic vice presidential nominees each weighed in on the news that has rocked the presidential race just days before the November 8 election.  \"I think what you see here is an example of real leadership,\" Pence, the GOP vice presidential nominee, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"  He cast it as correcting the FBI's July decision not to recommend charges against Clinton.

The issue for the FBI director is, is he following established protocols for a law enforcement investigation?\" Kaine said.  \"You know, criticism comes with the territory, but you can't tack and move one direction or the next to avoid criticism,\" he said. \"Following established protocols and rules is what you would expect from a chief law enforcement official.\"","articles_date":"30 10 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/10\/30\/politics\/pence-kaine-fbi-clinton-email-review\/index.html","articles_title":"Pence praises, Kaine criticizes FBI director","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":215,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) The Pentagon on Thursday provided lawmakers with a classified briefing detailing what the agency has uncovered so far in its investigation of the Niger ambush that left four US service members dead, amid swirling questions on Capitol Hill about the larger US strategy in Africa in the wake of the attack. Leaving the back-to-back briefings for the House and Senate Armed Services Committee, lawmakers said there are still many unanswered questions, including why it took 48 hours to recover the body of Sgt. La David Johnson, who was separated from the rest of the team, and how the attackers were tipped off to the presence of US troops. But the briefing has for now satisfied Arizona Sen. John McCain, the powerful Armed Services chairman who  blasted the Pentagon last week  for not being forthcoming about the attack and threatened to issue subpoenas if he did not get the information he was seeking. \"I am pleased at the cooperation we're getting now,\" McCain told reporters. \"It was an excellent briefing, we got a lot of good information. It's progress and we expect more, but this is what we've been asking for.\" However, McCain did express particular concern about why it took that much time to recover Johnson's body.  The Arizona senator said he was told the investigation is expected to last about 30 days, and once the Pentagon has finished with its assessment he'll decide whether to hold a public hearing on Niger. The October 4 attack has sparked questions not just about the specifics of the ambush but also about the role US forces are playing in Africa. The US Army team that was attacked had been gathering intelligence on a terrorist leader operating in the area before it was ambushed. US officials told CNN that the unit was not under orders to conduct a kill or capture mission on the leader, and the team was not directed to \"take direct action\" against enemy forces, according to a US defense official. \"I was encouraged by the testimony that on the initial assessment, there were not significant steps that could have been taken to prevent this assault,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican. \"The detailed investigation may produce different conclusions, so I'll certainly await the results of that investigation to ascertain what exactly occurred, but I was encouraged by the initial testimony.\" But the lack of drone support for the Niger mission and others like it was a significant concern to both Democrats and Republicans. Several noted that the head of US Africa Command, Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, told Congress in testimony earlier this year that he only had 20% to 30% of his command's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance needs fulfilled. \"That shortfall has not changed, and the tragic outcome of this incident in my view, can be attributed to lack of support in intelligence and resources that are necessary,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. The attack has also sparked new questions about whether the war against ISIS is moving to Africa as operations wind down in Iraq and Syria, and whether the US needs to adjust its strategy accordingly. \"The more we succeed in the Middle East, the more we're going to see snakes run to Africa,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican. \"And we've got to be prepared to advise and assist the nations there that are willing to work with us.\" House Armed Services chairman Mac Thornberry told reporters that he's hoping to get all the answers to what happened in Niger as quickly as possible, but he understands it's going to take time -- particularly because US investigators will need the cooperation of the French and Nigerien governments. \"You're never satisfied because there's an urgency to find out what happened,\" Thornberry said. \"So I expressed concern about how long the investigation is taking, until one of my colleagues reminded me we don't really know all the situation from Las Vegas yet. So it's a fair point, but we need to be right about it. We need to find the answers.\" CNN's Ted Barrett, Jamie Crawford, Jim Sciutto  and Ryan Browne contributed reporting","articles_date":"26 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/26\/politics\/pentagon-congress-niger-briefing\/index.html","articles_title":"Pentagon officials brief Congress on Niger attack","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":216,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) You may have read about the  new study  from political scientists that ranks President Donald Trump as the worst president ever. There's nothing inherently wrong with the study, and the political scientists who worked on it are well-respected. Most Americans, though, don't rank Trump  as the worst president ever , even if most  disapprove of the job Trump is doing .  Indeed, there is good reason to be cautious in using this study of political scientists to determine what Trump's place in history is at this point or what it will ultimately be. Why? 1. The survey respondents are not Trump friendly The majority of respondents (57%) self-identified as Democrats compared to just 13% who were Republicans. That 44-percentage-point split is about 35 to 40 points wider than what is found in the general public, according to polls  from Gallup . Given that Trump's approval rating nationally  among Democrats is in the single digits , it shouldn't be too surprising that his ranking among a very Democratic-leaning sample of political scientists is quite low.  Interestingly, the survey also found that Republican political scientists were also not fans of Trump. The 21 of them who took part in the survey (a small sample size to be sure) ranked Trump an average of 40th out of 44 presidents. In other words, the survey respondents didn't just hate Trump because he was a Republican.  These Republican political scientists probably aren't your normal Republicans, however. Although there is no reliable polling data that I'm aware of on Republican political scientists and their vote choice in 2016, I decided to take a look at how the precincts around some college campuses voted in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. I did so to get an idea of how these political scientists might have voted. Specifically, I looked at the precincts around Harvard University ( Cambridge ), the University of Alabama ( Tuscaloosa ), University of Michigan ( Ann Arbor ), University of North Carolina ( Chapel Hill ), University of Texas ( Austin ) and the University of Wisconsin ( Madison ). I chose these campuses because they are in different parts of the country. All of them, with the exception of Harvard, are also flagship state universities in states where Trump won the general election. Trump finished first in the primary in none of these areas. In fact, he never finished above 30% of the vote. Interestingly, Ted Cruz didn't win any of these areas either. Instead, John Kasich and Marco Rubio won them, despite the fact that neither of them won or even came close to winning any of the states these contests were held in.  2. These surveys are capturing a moment in time among a specific subset Keep in mind, those polled were a very specific segment of the population. They are \"current and recent members of the Presidents & Executive Politics Section of the American Political Science Association.\" The results could have been different if they polled historians, for example.  Just last year, C-SPAN  surveyed a group of   mostly historians . Now, Trump wasn't asked about in that C-SPAN sample. Still, there were some differences between the survey of political scientists and historians. C-SPAN found James Polk ranked 14th instead of 20th as the political scientists did. They put John Adams at 19th instead of 14th. Both of these differences occurred, even though neither Adams nor Polk has been president in over 150 years.  Even among political scientists, these surveys don't necessarily stay consistent. Ulysses Grant, who was president in the 1870s, rose from 28th in a 2014 survey of political scientists to 21st in this one. Andrew Jackson, who was president in the 1830s, fell from ninth to 15th.  What changed? There could have been different political scientists taking the survey. Some political scientists may have also changed their mind. Some zeitgeist factors could be in play: Grant was the recent focus of a widely acclaimed biography by \"Alexander Hamilton\" author Ron Chernow while Jackson's name has been on the chopping block for state-level Democratic fundraisers and possibly the 20-dollar bill. (Jackson, by the way, is a favorite of Trump's, so that could also be attention that hasn't helped him with this crowd.) In other words, popular opinion may have changed on presidents in a very short time for presidents who haven't been in office for over 100 years. 3. Modern presidents are even more difficult to judge The single-digit movement among presidents who served more than 100 years ago is nothing compared to the last two presidents who have been out of office for more than five years. During his presidency, a 2005  Wall Street Journal poll  of professors gave George W. Bush a ranking of 19th. A  Siena College survey  of presidential scholars just after his presidency in 2010 put Bush at 39th. The 2018 political scientist survey placed Bush at 30th. Likewise, Bill Clinton has seen major movement in his ratings. A  Wall Street Journal poll  taken during the Clinton presidency in 2000 put him at 24th. He rose to eighth in the aforementioned 2014 political scientist survey. He dropped to 13th in the most recent one.    Now, each set of judges may have had good reasons to vote the way they did, but the fact that the ratings changed frequently and by a lot gives you an idea of the fragility of them.  The Trump administration still has years to go. Something could occur that ends up changing the course of history. Trump could end up being a disaster in most people's minds by the end of it. He could end up surprising some folks.  The bottom line is that we don't know what's going to happen. Just don't be surprised if you turn around in a few years and find that Trump's position in the presidential rankings has changed.

The nominee,  Mike Pompeo , will face a grilling Thursday during his hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But in an unusual move, Pompeo is already privately courting moderate Democratic senators who don't serve on that committee, in what lawmakers in both parties say is a sign of the significant challenges facing the nomination. Already, Pompeo has lost the support of Republican Rand Paul, a Kentucky senator who serves on the committee, which is a significant defection given the GOP's one-vote advantage on the panel. That means Pompeo will have to win over at least one Democratic vote to get a favorable vote in committee. The focus will heavily be on New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, both of whom voted for Pompeo as CIA director and serve on the panel. But both senators have been skeptical of Pompeo's nomination to State, as many Democrats raise concerns over his hawkish views and worry he won't be an independent voice willing to stand up to Trump. And in the event that all committee Democrats vote against his nomination and Paul votes \"no,\" Republicans would be forced to take procedural steps to advance the nomination to the floor without a recommendation from the panel, amounting to a rebuke to the nominee. Pompeo still, however, could be confirmed as secretary of state if he wins a simple majority on the floor. But with a narrowly divided chamber,  Sen. John McCain absent as he recovers  from brain cancer and if Paul remains a \"no\" vote, Pompeo would need at least one Democratic senator to break ranks to advance the nomination. So behind the scenes, Pompeo, a former House member who lawmakers say is skilled at the art of schmoozing privately with senators, is beginning his outreach to potential \"yes\" votes on the floor. He met for about an hour Monday evening with Sen. Angus King, the independent Maine senator who caucuses with Democrats and voted for Pompeo as CIA director. He also met with Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a vulnerable Democrat who is open to backing his nomination to State but also does not serve on the Foreign Relations Committee. And he may meet soon with Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative West Virginia Democrat who faces a tough re-election this year. \"I've left that completely open before he testifies,\" Manchin told CNN when asked about voting for Pompeo. Heitkamp said she had a \"good meeting\" with Pompeo late last month. \"I'm waiting for the hearing before I decide what I'm going to do. ... My biggest concern would be the exercise of independent judgment.\" Pompeo has been privately assuring senators he'd be a voice of moderation within the administration, even suggesting he would not advocate tearing up the Iran nuclear deal, which he has sharply criticized in the past, saying it should be fixed first before any decision to nix it, according to two other senators who have met with him. Whether that's enough to win over Democrats remains to be seen. \"I think it's way too early to make that prediction,\" said Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and a member of the panel who met with Pompeo for 45 minutes Tuesday but made clear he still has concerns about the nominee. \"I think most members of the committee have not made decisions. ... It's way too early to make those judgments.\" Pompeo won the support of King and 14 Democrats as CIA director, but nearly all of them have made clear that they view the State Department much differently and are approaching this vote more skeptically. It would be highly unusual for Pompeo to be confirmed without a favorable vote in the committee. From 1987 to 2016, the Senate didn't confirm any nominee who got an unfavorable vote in their respective committees, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. During that time, two Cabinet-level nominees were rejected on the floor of the Senate after failing to win approval in committee, including John Tower as secretary of defense in 1989 and John Bolton in 2005, who was filibustered by Senate Democrats to be United Nations ambassador before being installed as a recess appointment by then-President George W. Bush. RELATED: Trump replaces H.R. McMaster as national security adviser with John Bolton The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, said Tuesday it's premature to say whether the GOP leadership will advance the nomination to the floor should Pompeo lose support in the committee. The Tennessee Republican said he's \"very impressed\" with Pompeo but that Democratic opposition could be significant. \"I think the frustrations that some Democrats have with the President might affect how they vote,\" Corker said. \"I'm just being honest.\" Another complication for Pompeo: He faces a top Democrat on the committee, Bob Menendez, who is prepared to aggressively question the nominee at the hearing Thursday. Menendez was not the top Democrat during last year's hearings for Pompeo's predecessor, Rex Tillerson, because the New Jersey Democrat had been sidelined amid corruption charges.  After being cleared of the charges , Menendez has resumed his top spot and is bound to set the tone for an aggressive hearing. \"Menendez is going to be tough,\" said one Democratic source on the committee. A source familiar with Pompeo's confirmation prep said he's met with many senators not on the committee, in addition to lawmakers who serve on the panel, including Menendez. \"He is taking this extremely seriously. He is meeting with every person he can, given the time that he has, to help the confirmation process -- not only with the committee,\" the source said. \"He realizes a hundred senators will be voting for him. He has not assumed confirmation at all.\" During his private meetings, the source said, he's heard a lot of policy-related differences, and has been asked to explain his past votes and controversial comments he made during campaigns. He has been trying to contextualize these votes and statements, the source said. While Democrats have pressed him about the administration's views on a wide range of topics, from North Korea to Russia, they are eager to hear how he'll manage a department that has been depleted. \"The big thing is that while they may (disagree) on specific policies, they have in Mike Pompeo a person who is willing to work with them to strengthen the State Department,\" the source close to the nominee said.  It's still possible Pompeo could get a favorable vote in committee. While Paul is likely to vote against him, the two men may meet before Thursday, the senator told CNN. Plus Pompeo met with Kaine and Shaheen Tuesday, and both kept the door open to his nomination. \"These hearings have changed my mind before,\" Kaine told CNN. \"So I'm walking in with a lot of questions but I'll wait until the hearing.\" Beyond their policy differences, Shaheen said she wants to know Pompeo's thoughts on restoring the morale of the State Department, its diplomatic corps and Tillerson's reorganization efforts. \"This is a very different job than CIA director,\" she said. \"It's different skills.\" CNN's Jeremy Herb, Ted Barrett, Nicole Gaouette and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.","articles_date":"10 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/10\/politics\/mike-pompeo-confirmation-senators\/index.html","articles_title":"Pompeo moves to court moderate Dems ahead of tough vote in committee","candidate_fk":4,"first_name":"Joe","id":218,"issue":8,"last_name":"Manchin","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) President Donald Trump's nominee to be secretary of state, facing an uphill climb to win Senate confirmation, is moving behind the scenes to win over moderate Democratic senators who could provide a lifeline to his nomination once it reaches the Senate floor.

Already, Pompeo has lost the support of Republican Rand Paul, a Kentucky senator who serves on the committee, which is a significant defection given the GOP's one-vote advantage on the panel. That means Pompeo will have to win over at least one Democratic vote to get a favorable vote in committee. The focus will heavily be on New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, both of whom voted for Pompeo as CIA director and serve on the panel. But both senators have been skeptical of Pompeo's nomination to State, as many Democrats raise concerns over his hawkish views and worry he won't be an independent voice willing to stand up to Trump. And in the event that all committee Democrats vote against his nomination and Paul votes \"no,\" Republicans would be forced to take procedural steps to advance the nomination to the floor without a recommendation from the panel, amounting to a rebuke to the nominee. Pompeo still, however, could be confirmed as secretary of state if he wins a simple majority on the floor. But with a narrowly divided chamber,  Sen. John McCain absent as he recovers  from brain cancer and if Paul remains a \"no\" vote, Pompeo would need at least one Democratic senator to break ranks to advance the nomination. So behind the scenes, Pompeo, a former House member who lawmakers say is skilled at the art of schmoozing privately with senators, is beginning his outreach to potential \"yes\" votes on the floor. He met for about an hour Monday evening with Sen. Angus King, the independent Maine senator who caucuses with Democrats and voted for Pompeo as CIA director. He also met with Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a vulnerable Democrat who is open to backing his nomination to State but also does not serve on the Foreign Relations Committee. And he may meet soon with Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative West Virginia Democrat who faces a tough re-election this year. \"I've left that completely open before he testifies,\" Manchin told CNN when asked about voting for Pompeo. Heitkamp said she had a \"good meeting\" with Pompeo late last month. \"I'm waiting for the hearing before I decide what I'm going to do. ... My biggest concern would be the exercise of independent judgment.\" Pompeo has been privately assuring senators he'd be a voice of moderation within the administration, even suggesting he would not advocate tearing up the Iran nuclear deal, which he has sharply criticized in the past, saying it should be fixed first before any decision to nix it, according to two other senators who have met with him. Whether that's enough to win over Democrats remains to be seen. \"I think it's way too early to make that prediction,\" said Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and a member of the panel who met with Pompeo for 45 minutes Tuesday but made clear he still has concerns about the nominee. \"I think most members of the committee have not made decisions. ... It's way too early to make those judgments.\" Pompeo won the support of King and 14 Democrats as CIA director, but nearly all of them have made clear that they view the State Department much differently and are approaching this vote more skeptically. It would be highly unusual for Pompeo to be confirmed without a favorable vote in the committee. From 1987 to 2016, the Senate didn't confirm any nominee who got an unfavorable vote in their respective committees, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. During that time, two Cabinet-level nominees were rejected on the floor of the Senate after failing to win approval in committee, including John Tower as secretary of defense in 1989 and John Bolton in 2005, who was filibustered by Senate Democrats to be United Nations ambassador before being installed as a recess appointment by then-President George W. Bush. RELATED: Trump replaces H.R. McMaster as national security adviser with John Bolton The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, said Tuesday it's premature to say whether the GOP leadership will advance the nomination to the floor should Pompeo lose support in the committee. The Tennessee Republican said he's \"very impressed\" with Pompeo but that Democratic opposition could be significant. \"I think the frustrations that some Democrats have with the President might affect how they vote,\" Corker said. \"I'm just being honest.\" Another complication for Pompeo: He faces a top Democrat on the committee, Bob Menendez, who is prepared to aggressively question the nominee at the hearing Thursday. Menendez was not the top Democrat during last year's hearings for Pompeo's predecessor, Rex Tillerson, because the New Jersey Democrat had been sidelined amid corruption charges.  After being cleared of the charges , Menendez has resumed his top spot and is bound to set the tone for an aggressive hearing. \"Menendez is going to be tough,\" said one Democratic source on the committee. A source familiar with Pompeo's confirmation prep said he's met with many senators not on the committee, in addition to lawmakers who serve on the panel, including Menendez. \"He is taking this extremely seriously. He is meeting with every person he can, given the time that he has, to help the confirmation process -- not only with the committee,\" the source said. \"He realizes a hundred senators will be voting for him. He has not assumed confirmation at all.\" During his private meetings, the source said, he's heard a lot of policy-related differences, and has been asked to explain his past votes and controversial comments he made during campaigns. He has been trying to contextualize these votes and statements, the source said. While Democrats have pressed him about the administration's views on a wide range of topics, from North Korea to Russia, they are eager to hear how he'll manage a department that has been depleted. \"The big thing is that while they may (disagree) on specific policies, they have in Mike Pompeo a person who is willing to work with them to strengthen the State Department,\" the source close to the nominee said.  It's still possible Pompeo could get a favorable vote in committee. While Paul is likely to vote against him, the two men may meet before Thursday, the senator told CNN. Plus Pompeo met with Kaine and Shaheen Tuesday, and both kept the door open to his nomination. \"These hearings have changed my mind before,\" Kaine told CNN. \"So I'm walking in with a lot of questions but I'll wait until the hearing.\" Beyond their policy differences, Shaheen said she wants to know Pompeo's thoughts on restoring the morale of the State Department, its diplomatic corps and Tillerson's reorganization efforts. \"This is a very different job than CIA director,\" she said. \"It's different skills.\" CNN's Jeremy Herb, Ted Barrett, Nicole Gaouette and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.","articles_date":"10 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/10\/politics\/mike-pompeo-confirmation-senators\/index.html","articles_title":"Pompeo moves to court moderate Dems ahead of tough vote in committee","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":219,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"President Barack Obama on Thursday signed major Veterans Affairs Department legislation intended to speed up access to healthcare for thousands of veterans and hold accountable any executives deemed to be incompetent or abusing their positions. ADVERTISEMENT The $16.3 billion Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act expands community healthcare options for veterans who face long wait times or commutes; funds the hiring of more doctors, nurses and other health-care workers; and improves accountability by making it easier for the agency secretary to fire problem executives. \u201cOver the last few months we\u2019ve discovered some inexcusable misconduct at some VA health care facilities,\u201d Obama said during a signing ceremony at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. He cited long wait times for care and employees \u201ccooking the books\u201d to hide the delays. \u201cThis is wrong. It\u2019s outrageous, and working together we set out to fix it,\u201d Obama said. He warned that those found culpable of manipulating data or covering up problems need to go, and also praised whistleblowers who brought problems to the media and public\u2019s attention. \u201cIf you engaged in an unethical practice, if you covered up serious problems, you should be fired. Period,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you blow the whistle on unethical practices or bring a problem to the attention of higher ups, you should be thanked. You should be protected for doing the right thing. You shouldn\u2019t be ignored and you certainly shouldn\u2019t be punished.\u201d Some officials have already been relieved of duties and investigations into the matter continue, the president said. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, who chair the veterans' affairs committees in their respective chambers, negotiated the final legislation as co-chairmen of the conference committee. \"In a dysfunctional Congress, I'm glad we accomplished something significant for veterans,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"This legislation will go a long way toward ending unacceptably long waiting times for veterans to access health care and allow the VA the resources to hire the doctors, nurses and other medical staff it needs to address these problems over the long term.\" Miller could not make the signing ceremony because of a previously scheduled oversight visit to the William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, with Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas. But in a statement he said he was \"pleased President Obama has finally recognized what we have been telling administration officials for years: that VA's widespread and systemic lack of accountability is jeopardizing the health of veterans and contributing to all of the department's most pressing problems. \"I sincerely hope the president views this event as more than just a photo-op or speaking engagement. Instead, it should serve as a wakeup call,\" Miller said. The legislation passed Congress the same week the Senate confirmed Robert McDonald, a West Point grad, Army veteran and former chief executive officer \u00a0for consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co., to be secretary of veterans affairs. McDonald took over from Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson, an undersecretary at the department installed temporarily to lead the agency in May after Eric Shinseki resigned amidst the growing scandal. But neither McDonald's appointment nor the VA reform legislation is halting congressional inquiries into mismanagement at the agency. Just this week, Miller accused VA officials of deliberately misleading his committee on the number of veteran deaths since 1999 were linked to delays in medical consultations. In \u00a0a letter to McDonald dated Aug. 4, Miller said agency health care officials testified several times that a VA review of 250 million consults since 1999 determined that 23 patients died from gastrointestinal illnesses because of delays in medical consultation. Not only were the review dates given in testimony by Under Secretary for Health Carolyn Clancy and Assistant Deputy Undersecretary Thomas Lynch, but were noted in an April fact sheet the VA provided Miller's committee. Miller said the VA now concedes that the actual review only covered the years 2010 to 2012, but has not explained why the actual dates were not provided. \"They tried to misdirect Congress and the American people away from the facts,\" Miller told The Tampa Bay Times in an interview. \"I think they got caught and now they are trying to modify their story ... The misdirection was, in fact, designed in Washington.\" Miller is now demanding to know who was responsible for the fact sheet, how they are being held accountable for the misinformation and the actual number of deaths linked to consult delays back to 1999, where they occurred and how the numbers were determined or discovered. Wait times for care has been a problem for the VA for some time, but gained national attention in May after whistleblowers at the VA Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona, told CNN that up to 40 patients on a secret wait list may have died before getting an appointment. Subsequent VA investigations confirmed some 35 veteran deaths linked to the lists, which the hospital maintained to conceal the scope of their wait-times problems. Investigators also concluded that such manipulation of patient data was systemic throughout the VA. Additionally, some executives were pulling in thousands of dollars a year in bonuses that at least in part were based on meeting VA standards on wait times. Officials say some of these VA managers and executives could face criminal charges for directing the manipulation of data or appointments. American Legion Legislative Director Louis Celli was happy to see the bill passed and signed, but said, \u201cThis is not the time to set back in your chair, put your feet up on the desk and say everything is done now and the VA is fixed. \u201cThe provisions [of the bill] need to be enacted,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll be working with and we\u2019ll be watching the VA to make sure they\u2019re carried out and that the money is spent wisely, so veterans get the health care they need.\u201d Celli said the Legion will also be watching how McDonald fares during his first few months on the job. \u201cWe will issue a report on the first 100 days to say where we see the agency under his leadership is going and where he is going,\u201d he said. -- Bryant Jordan can be reached at bryant.jordan@monster.com.","articles_date":"07 08 2014","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2014\/08\/07\/president-obama-signs-163b-bill-to-overhaul-va.html","articles_title":"President Obama Signs $16.3B Bill to Overhaul VA","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":220,"issue":6,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"WASHINGTON -- In Arizona, the shooting death of a rancher blew the lid off simmering anger over border security and helped solidify support for a tough new immigration law. A similar eruption threatens in Virginia following the death of a Catholic nun in a car accident involving a man in the country illegally and accused of drunken driving. ADVERTISEMENT The Benedictine Sisters of Virginia tried to discourage using the death of Sister Denise Mosier as a \"forum of the illegal immigration agenda\" and pleaded for a focus on \"Christ's command to forgive.\" \"The sisters' mission is peace and love,\" said Corey Stewart, chairman of   County's Board of Supervisors. \"My mission is law enforcement and the protection of public safety.\" Prince William County, about 25 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., stepped up its immigration enforcement in 2007 amid explosive growth of its Hispanic and immigrant populations. Under Stewart's leadership, the county implemented a local policy requiring police to determine the immigration status of all people arrested on suspicion of violating state or local laws. Stewart rushed back into the immigration debate after the Aug. 1 accident, firing off a statement that President  ,   Secretary   and members of Congress \"all have blood on their hands.\" \"What I'm hoping is that this situation, which because it involves a nun has drawn the nation's attention, can serve as a catalyst for change and force the administration to come clean about its catch-and-release policies,\" Stewart said. He also says that the tragedy illustrates the need for Virginia to toughen its drunken driving laws. Even though Stewart says he's not running for higher office now, he is seen as a possible lieutenant governor candidate in three years. \"Regardless of what he says, there is no question people would be interested in seeing him move up within the  ,\" said Stephen Farnsworth, an assistant communications professor at George Mason University. The day after the crash, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II issued an advisory opinion concluding that police have authority to inquire into the immigration status of any person stopped or arrested, similar to the Arizona immigration law that is under federal court review. Arizona passed the law after rancher Robert Krentz was fatally shot while checking water lines on his property near the Arizona-Mexico border. Authorities believe a scout for drug smugglers is to blame, although an investigation continues. The sisters at the Bristow, Va., monastery have buried Mosier, who would have turned 67 on Aug. 26. Two other nuns injured in the crash, Charlotte Lange and Connie Ruth Lupton, have undergone surgery and remain in critical condition. The man charged in the case, Carlos A. Martinelly Montano, 23, of  , had two prior drunken driving convictions, but was not required to serve any of his 30-day sentence for the first one. A Prince William County judge required Montano to serve only 20 days of his approximately one-year sentence on his second conviction. Local officials turned him over to federal immigration enforcement officers after the second incident and after sentencing, but federal officers released him both times while he awaited hearings. Montano is being held at the Prince William County Adult Detention Center, and the county's prosecutor is promising to ask a grand jury to consider charges that could put him in prison for 40 years. Montano entered the U.S. illegally with his parents and siblings, his uncle Luis Ronald Montano told The Associated Press. He attended American schools in New Jersey and Virginia from third grade through high school. He is engaged and is the father of two boys, ages 1 and 2, who were born in Manassas, Va. For a few years, the family had asked Montano, a T-shirt screenprinter, to seek professional help for his  . His family took away his cars, but he had taken his mother's Subaru at the time of the crash. Luis Ronald Montano said the family understands Carlos has broken the law several times. They worry about the future of his two young sons. They expect he will be deported, but they have hired lawyers in hopes of keeping him here with minimum jail time. \"He's getting used to crucify all the illegal aliens in the  ,\" his uncle said. The nuns have forgiven Montano. Mercy and forgiveness, the nuns say on their website, are not optional for Christians. Nearly half of the 292,663 people deported or removed by ICE this year through July 22 were considered criminals. That compares to 34 percent, or 136,343, in all of last year, a reflection of ICE's focus on deporting people with criminal records. Removals of non-citizens who are not criminals are below what they were at the same time last year, which has become fodder for criticism of the Obama administration. The law requires mandatory detention for immigrants who have committed certain crimes. In other cases, immigration officials have to make judgment calls on whether to release someone. In those cases, ICE considers the likelihood that the person will be a danger to the community and the likelihood the person will appear at deportation hearings, said David Leopold, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Factors they consider are ties to the community, such as whether they have family members or citizen children in the U.S.; length of time in the country; how the person entered the country; other immigration violations; and a criminal record. A judge's decision to relax a sentence also could be considered, Leopold said. Stewart criticized ICE for releasing Montano, saying the county hands immigrants over \"on a silver platter\" after they've been convicted of crimes \"and still they release them back into communities.\" He's asking Congress to subpoena statistics from ICE on how many people who have committed crimes are released to the community. But Leopold dismissed the criticism, saying that no credible studies show that drunken driving is a problem particular to immigrants. \"Frankly, drunk driving is a national problem which we deal with in every community,\" he said. The Benedictine Sisters operate several ministries, including providing transitional housing for homeless women and their children and an adult literacy project. None solely targets undocumented immigrants, Smith said in an e-mail, and the services are available to everyone. The Rule of Benedict and the Gospel of Jesus Christ \"compels us to reach out to the neighbor and the stranger, to the rich and the poor, to all who may come to our door,\" Smith said. \"I might add that Sister Denise was a model for us in this reaching out and acceptance of diverse persons and cultures.\"","articles_date":"08 08 2010","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2010\/08\/08\/push-virginia-follow-arizonas-lead-anti-immigration-law-nuns-death.html","articles_title":"Push in Virginia to Follow Arizona's Lead on Anti-Immigration Law After Nun's Death","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":221,"issue":5,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Here's what you might have missed on CNN today: -- The top US diplomat dealing with North Korea is departing and America still lacks a permanent ambassador to Seoul.

Rand Paul is likely to secure a vote on ending the war authorizations the US military uses to fight terrorism across the globe. Paul's office announced he would get a vote Wednesday on the Kentucky Republican's amendment that would repeal the 2001 and 2002 war authorizations after six months, giving Congress time to pass a new Authorization for Use of Military Force for the wars against Al Qaeda, ISIS and the Taliban. A spokesman for Senate Majority Mitch McConnell did not respond to confirm Paul's statement, but three Senate aides said a vote was likely on Paul's amendment. The 2001 and 2002 AUMFs authorized the war against Al Qaeda and the Iraq War, and they provide the legal basis that the Obama administration and now the Trump administration has used for the fight against global terrorism. Senate leaders appear to have agreed to give Paul a vote on his amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act after he threatened to object to all other amendments, which would have effectively prevented any amendments from getting a vote on the massive defense policy bill. The vote will be on whether to kill Paul's amendment. On the Senate floor Tuesday, Paul argued that the current war against ISIS and Al Qaeda across the Middle East was illegal, and Congress should reassert its authority to declare war from the Executive Branch. \"For the first time in 16 years, I'm advocating we should vote on whether or not we should be at war,\" Paul said. \"Will senators idly sit by and let the wars continue, unabated and unauthorized?\" Paul's amendment likely faces an uphill climb to be adopted onto the defense bill, as many lawmakers have expressed concern about repealing the authorization the US military uses to fight ISIS and Al Qaeda without first replacing it. \"It would send a very inappropriate signal to our troops, to our allies in the fight across the globe, and also it would send an unfortunate signal to our adversaries,\" said Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate armed services committee. \"It would be read in many places as a signal the Senate has essentially declared in six months we are going to de-authorize military actions.\" The Trump administration has asserted that it has the authority it needs to conduct the war on terror, and many lawmakers say that is sufficient. But Paul could find support in both parties from the corner of the Capitol that has been pressing for a new war authorization since the US began military operations against ISIS in 2014. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has joined forces with Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona to draft a new war authorization, says he's likely to back Paul's amendment. \"I'm inclined to support it, because I think it will encourage the foreign relations committee to really grapple the Flake-Kaine AUMF,\" Kaine told CNN. Kaine and Flake are pressing the foreign relations committee to mark up their authorization, and the committee had Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson brief them on the issue last month. But Flake said Tuesday he wants to move through the committee and not through Paul's amendment that would repeal the current measures. \"I'm sympathetic to his concerns, but I don't think this is the way to go about it,\" Flake said. \"I'd rather do it in a deliberative fashion. I think we're getting there.\" In the House, the appropriations committee approved an amendment from California Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee to repeal the 2001 AUMF, but House Republican leaders used a procedural tactic to strip the amendment before the defense appropriations bill passed on the floor. If Paul drops his objections to other amendments -- and no other senators raise their own -- there are a number of other contentious issues that might get votes on the defense policy bill, although there are hundreds of amendments that have been offered. New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins introduced an amendment on Monday that would  push back on President Donald Trump's proposed transgender ban  by blocking the Trump administration from discharging service members solely on the basis of their gender identity. Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Kamala Harris of California have proposed an amendment to protect military personnel who are recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) authorization. And Sen. Tom Cotton has proposed an amendment that would end the sequestration budget caps for both defense and non-defense spending, which as currently written would prevent the Pentagon's proposed $54 billion budget increase from taking shape.\"","articles_date":"12 9 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/09\/12\/politics\/paul-congress-war-vote\/index.html","articles_title":"Rand Paul likely to get a war vote","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":224,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) As the 2016 Presidential election winds down, we look back fondly (?) on the biggest whoppers of the general campaign.

June 9, 2016 -- the day that  Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort  met with a Russian lawyer to get opposition research on Hillary Clinton -- was a 24-hour period that the businessman-turned-presidential candidate likely hated: The spotlight wasn't on him. But more than a year after that unseasonably cool Thursday in New York, what happened on June 9 has intensified the spotlight on Trump -- now president -- and his family. News of the meeting between Natalia Veselnitskaya, billed in an email as a \"Russian government attorney\" and three of Trump's top campaign aides has rocked the Trump White House and led Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Sen.

Obama's backing of Clinton was always assumed, but Trump quickly responded. \"Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary,\" he wrote on Twitter at 2:22p ET. \"He wants four more years of Obama\u2014but nobody else does!\"   Clinton, in her most retweeted tweet of the entire campaign, responded to Trump: \"Delete your account,\" she wrote.     Trump's retort took two hours: \"How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?\" The back-and-forth was a preview of the biting, negative campaign that two New Yorkers would wage in the coming months. But little did anyone know that Trump's tweet about Clinton's deleted emails came 40 minutes after his son's meeting with Veselnitskaya was scheduled. Trump's attorneys and White House officials have said the President found out about his son's meeting only days ago. But on June 7, Trump teased on Twitter that he would deliver a \"major speech\" to discuss \"all the things that have taken place with the Clintons.\" \"I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons,\" Trump said during a speech after winning the California, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and New Jersey primaries. \"I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting. I wonder if the press will want to attend. Who knows?\"  The speech was later moved to June 22 -- due to the deadly terrorist attack at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando -- but Trump called on Clinton's deleted emails \"to be found.\" \"Should be able to be found because the government -- I will say, I've always heard you can never really delete an email,\" he said. \"So it should be able to be found if they really want to find them, but I don't think they want to find them.\" Trump campaign timeline 1:02 p.m. : Donald Trump leaves the Four Seasons, where he attended a Trump Victory Fund fundraising lunch. Trump returns to Trump Tower, where he remained for the rest of the afternoon. 2:18 p.m. : Paul Manafort leaves Four Seasons. 4 p.m. : Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, Manafort meet with Russian lawyer at Trump Tower 4:40 p.m. : Trump responds to a Hillary Clinton tweet with a dig about her emails. According to emails released by Trump's eldest son on Tuesday, the meeting was scheduled for 4:00 p.m. ET in Donald Trump Jr.'s office at 725 Fifth Avenue -- Trump Tower. The meeting, according Trump Jr.'s lawyer, lasted 20 to 30 minutes. The emails, which Donald Trump Jr. released Tuesday ahead of  a story by The New York Times  set to detail the exchanges, show him willing to take information from someone described to him as a \"Russian government attorney\" whose information was \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\" The interlocutor who connected Trump Jr. with Veselnitskaya also publicized the fact he was at Trump Tower on June 9. Rob Goldstone, a publicist who represents the son of an Azerbaijani-Russian businessman close to the Russian government, posted on Facebook that he was \"preparing for meeting\" at Trump Tower on June 9. Goldstone, in the emails released Tuesday, said he would not attend the meeting but would escort the lawyer to Trump Tower. Trump Jr. told Goldstone that if his emails are \"what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\" according to the email chain Trump Jr. released. Trump's only semi-public event of the day was his first fundraiser with the Trump Victory Fund, his campaign's joint fundraising effort with the Republican National Committee and a smattering of state Republican parties. At New York's tony Four Seasons Hotel, Trump met for lunch with dozens of top Republican donors to chart his fundraising plan for the general election. Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chair who now serves as Trump's chief of staff, attended the fundraiser and was seen walking into Trump Tower around 10:53 a.m. ET before the event. Trump left the donor meeting around 1:02 p.m. ET and returned to Trump Tower, the eponymous building where he both lives and works. The trip from the Four Seasons was less than two blocks. Trump remained at Trump Tower for the rest of the afternoon. Meanwhile, back in Chappaqua ... Clinton, after a surprisingly grueling primary against liberal Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, unofficially cinched the Democratic nomination three days earlier, according to an Associated Press delegate count -- on June 6 -- before an event in Long Beach, California. After coyly mentioning the news that had already reverberated around the Long Beach City College gym, Clinton's focus now turned to unifying the Democratic Party and squaring up against Trump, who was already the presumed Republican nominee. Clinton crossed the country on June 7 and headlined arguably the most significant political event of her life as she became the first female presidential nominee from a major US political party, the crowning achievement on her storied career. \"We believe that we are stronger together and the stakes in this election are high and the choice is clear,\" Clinton, who was introduced by a 3-minute video that acknowledged the history of the moment, told a cheering crowd at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. \"Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be the President of the United States.\"  Clinton, according to campaign records, was home on June 9 as Trump's son met with the Russian lawyer.  After a largely media free primary campaign, Clinton marked the turn to the general election with a series of interviews meant to celebrate Obama's endorsement and her turn to the general. Clinton -- starting in the afternoon -- did phone interviews with Bloomberg, Reuters, Politico and NPR from her leafy home in Chappaqua, New York, an estate that is a mere 35 miles from Trump Tower. It's unclear whether Clinton was speaking with reporters when the meeting at Trump Tower took place, but Clinton was reflecting more on her win against Sanders in the interviews than her future contest with Trump. Clinton told NPR she was \"thrilled\" by Obama's endorsement and was said she looked \"forward to working with (Bernie Sanders) during the campaign and then on after the inauguration.\" \"I think his campaign was good for the Democratic Party, good for our country,\" she said. \"And I know how passionate he is about the issues he cares about. So we'll have a long list of matters to discuss when we sit down.\" Clinton would continue to make calls later in the afternoon and spent a largely uneventful night, according to an aide, at her New York home on June 9 before waking up and flying to Washington on June 10 for a speech to Planned Parenthood and a visit to a local muffin shop. \"In the afterglow of clinching the nomination, she was celebrating our win,\" Nick Merrill, Clinton's spokesman said Tuesday, \"while the Trumps were colluding with Kremlin.\" CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Jeremy Diamond, Ashley Killough and Bonney Kapp contributed to this report.","articles_date":"12 7 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/07\/11\/politics\/trump-campaign-june-9\/index.html","articles_title":"Recreating June 9: A very consequential day in the 2016 campaign","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":226,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus reiterated his support Monday for embattled Republican nominee Donald Trump -- telling members of the RNC that the operation stands fully behind his campaign.  \"Nothing has changed in regard with our relationship,\" Priebus said in a call with RNC committee members, according to sources on the call. \"We are in full coordination with the Trump campaign. We have a great relationship with them. And we are going to continue to work together to make sure he wins in November.\" The move to present a united front with the Trump campaign comes after earlier Monday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan told Republican members of the House he would  no longer defend  Trump, but did not formally rescind his endorsement. Priebus convened the call with members on short notice over the weekend, and did not take any questions. His remarks lasted less than 14 minutes.  Trump's support in the Republican Party has eroded in the past few days after a 2005 recording surfaced of him making lewd and sexually aggressive comments toward women. Several prominent members of the party have pulled support for Trump, and the vast majority have publicly condemned his comments. Which Republicans are abandoning Trump and which are sticking with him? Monday, Priebus emphasized he does not defend the controversial remarks.  \"Like all of you, I don't condone what was said in the video,\" he said. \"In fact, the campaign itself doesn't defend the words in that video.\" But the GOP chairman said that Trump comported himself well in Sunday night's debate and apologized from the heart.  Priebus also pushed back on media reports of turmoil inside the RNC or efforts to pull back support from Trump. He said no one has left the RNC or the campaign, and said there were no meetings about rules to replace a nominee. He also said no efforts through the party and campaign's joint operation, Trump Victory, were halted.  He said efforts were \"ahead of budget\" and donations were still strong.  \"Everything is on course,\" Priebus said.  He also dismissed as \"silly\" the protest at RNC headquarters organized by a former Virginia campaign chairman for Trump, noting that the man, Corey Stewart, had been let go by the campaign.  Trump campaign fires Virginia chair after protest Priebus' move stood in contrast with the tone struck by Ryan, a close friend and political ally of the chairman, on a call with his GOP conference Monday morning.  Ryan told members he would not defend Trump and focus on protecting Republican majorities in Congress. He faced pushback from a few members on the call who accused him of ceding the White House. Ryan spokesman Zack Roday said the speaker \"made it clear on the call he's not conceding the presidential race.\" CNN's Manu Raju contributed to this report.

Evan Jenkins announced Monday that he plans to challenge Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia, a seat that Republicans consider within their reach in next year's midterm elections. Jenkins, who represents the state's 3rd Congressional District, criticized Manchin in a  nearly three-minute announcement video , painting the incumbent senator as a Washington insider and knocking him for supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016. A former governor with deep ties to the state, Manchin has wide name recognition in West Virginia but faces re-election as a Democrat in a state that voted for President Donald Trump by 42 points over Clinton last November.  Manchin charts own path in Trump-era West Virginia Jenkins, who previously served as a Democrat in the West Virginia Senate, was elected to the US House in 2014 as a Republican, defeating incumbent Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall. Jenkins was re-elected in 2016.  The video also hits Manchin on his 2013 proposal to expand background checks for gun purchases following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.  Jefrey Pollock, a spokesperson for Manchin's campaign, did not address each claim in the video, but sought to highlight Manchin's bipartisan record.   \"Senator Manchin has always been an independent fighter for West Virginia, willing to take on either party to do what is right for his state,\" Pollock said in a statement. \"He looks forward to seeing the results of the GOP primary and having the voters review his clear record of delivering results for the people of West Virginia.\" Since Trump was elected, Manchin has sought to work with the president on a number of issues, even bucking his own party at times to support many of Trump's picks for his Cabinet and the Supreme Court.  Jenkins also sought to align himself with Trump in the new video by including footage of him standing behind Trump at the White House when the President signed a law to repeal an Obama-era rule on the coal industry. (Manchin, along with West Virginia lawmakers, was at the same photo opportunity, but was not included in Jenkins' video.) Manchin is seeking a second full term. He first came to the US Senate in 2010 to fill the seat left vacant by Sen. Robert Byrd, and won election to a full term in 2012. Last week a former coal company employee, Bo Copley, also announced that he plans to run in the Republican primary. Copley became well-known in West Virginia last year after  confronting Hillary Clinton over a statement she made about the coal industry .  State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is also considered a potential Republican challenger.","articles_date":"8 5 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/05\/08\/politics\/west-virginia-senate-race\/index.html","articles_title":"Rep.

Rep. Eric Swalwell called on Congress to vote on military authorization for the US' clashes with forces supporting Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad on CNN's \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\"  \"It looks like we are at war in Syria,\" Swalwell said. \"But this would be a war that would be without the authorization of Congress, and it's time that Congress votes on: What is the timeline? What is the troop commitment? And what is the terrain that is covered?\" A US fighter jet  shot down  an Iranian made pro-regime drone Monday, and the US Navy  shot down  a Syrian warplane on Sunday. President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama's administrations have used a 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force against al Qaeda to legally justify a range of anti-terror military actions.  A lot of forces with competing aims are at close quarters in eastern Syria. The United States is aggressively backing a Syrian rebel alliance -- the Syrian Democratic Forces -- as they fight their way into Raqqa, ISIS' administrative capital for the past three years. The Syrian army and its allies (largely Iranian, Iraqi and Lebanese Shia militia), however, are also closing in on Raqqa. Last week the Syrian military reached areas controlled by the SDF. It was almost inevitable that at some point these opposing alliances would butt heads. So when the Syrian air force bombed SDF positions Sunday, the US came to the aid of its partners on the ground -- and the Syrians have one fewer fighter jet. The Pentagon said the action was \"in accordance with rules of engagement and in collective self-defense of coalition partnered forces,\" but that was not the view in Moscow. Lawmakers like Swalwell say Congress should vote on a new AUMF -- and have argued that the 2001 authorization does not allow for strikes against pro-regime forces not aligned with terror groups. Virginia Democrat Sen. Tim Kaine and Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake are attempting to get Congress to vote on an AUMF against ISIS, al Queda and the Taliban, CNN  reported  in May.  The Senate foreign relations committee held a  90-minute hearing  Tuesday to consider issues around authorizations for the use of military force.

Senators took a key step toward opening debate on immigration Monday evening, kicking off an exercise with little modern precedent that could affect millions of lawful and undocumented immigrants. The procedural vote, which passed 97-1, allows the Senate to next vote to officially open debate -- a vote expected on Tuesday. But Senate Republican leadership said Democrats would have to act fast if they wanted to offer proposals.  \"This is Sen. (Dick) Durbin and Democrats' opportunity and so far they kind of seem to be a little confused about what they're planning on doing -- but they better get it done quick because it's this week or not at all,\" said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn.  \"We need to get it wrapped up by Thursday,\" Cornyn said. Just an hour previous, Cornyn had told reporters the opposite, saying: \"We could do it this week if there is cooperation. If there is not, it might take longer.\" A GOP leadership aide said Republicans want to light a fire under Democrats and get them to release their amendments. GOP leaders are worried Democrats want to drag out the debate for \"weeks and weeks.\" \"That's the plan,\" said GOP leadership member Sen. John Barrasso when asked if this would be finished this week. He added that \"Democrats have been waiting for this for a long time. They were promised we'd go to the floor with this and it's now on the floor.\" Aides and lawmakers were unsure of any agreements on proceeding expeditiously. Without unanimous agreement from all senators, each amendment could take hours to consider. It was also unclear how far afield amendments would get, and if senators would be able to offer proposals on any provision of immigration or just the four pillars being proposed by President Donald Trump: border security, broadly defined to included physical security and enforcement powers; ending the diversity visa lottery; curtailing family-based migration; and a permanent solution for the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , the policy that allowed undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children to stay in the country and that Trump has decided to end.  Negotiators hope to have plan Tuesday Democrats and moderate Republicans negotiating with them, meanwhile, said they have nothing finalized -- yet. But the goal, they said, is to have something by Tuesday. \"We are continuing to really talk turkey, legislative language etc,\" said Democrat Sen. Tim Kaine, who is part of a bipartisan group negotiating on the topic. \"We're making progress, but,\" he added, trailing off. \"It may be (ready Tuesday), not for sure.\" \"We're close but we're not ready right yet,\" said Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who co-leads the group.  \"No, that's being worked on,\" Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said when asked if he was concerned about the lack of an offer. \"We'll have that by tomorrow.\" What's next The Senate is stepping into uncharted waters for recent history. Different amendments will be offered that will compete for 60 votes, the threshold to advance legislation in the Senate. If a proposal can reach that number, it will likely pass the upper chamber -- but face an uncertain future in a House and White House that has not made any commitments to the eventual result.  The No. 2 Senate Democrat and longtime immigration reform advocate, Durbin said the only path forward he could see was getting at least 11 Republicans to join the 49 Democrats in the Senate.  \"I'd feel much more optimistic and if I knew ... 11 Republican names,\" Durbin told reporters Monday afternoon. \"We believe we have five or six strongly moving in our direction, and I feel that are another five are within reach, and I'm constantly talking to every Republican privately.\" On Monday afternoon, senators took to the floor of the upper chamber to speak on the upcoming debate, with a group of Republicans supporting a version of the  White House framework that they introduced Sunday night .  That proposal got the support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though he did not indicate that he would tip the scales in its favor procedurally.  \"It's our best chance to producing a solution that can actually resolve these matters,\" McConnell said. Democrats say the White House framework supported only by Republicans couldn't pass.  \"The only enemy to this process is overreach,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \"Now is not the time nor the place to reform the entire legal immigration system.\" Monday afternoon, Durbin said he had faith in McConnell to keep his promise to be neutral in the process. \"I told Mitch McConnell looking him in the eye and said, 'I trust you ... and I defended you among some Democrats who were skeptical,'\" Durbin said. \"I was skeptical. I'm defending him now -- I think he's going to play it straight.\"","articles_date":"12 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/12\/politics\/immigration-debate-advances-one-week\/index.html","articles_title":"Republican leaders say Senate immigration debate may end Thursday","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":230,"issue":5,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Mitt Romney declared his bid for the US Senate from Utah on Friday. Despite being a fellow Republican, Romney is expected to be a thorn in President Donald Trump's side. Romney refused to endorse Trump during the 2016 campaign and, although he didn't reference the President by name, Romney made it clear with a number of references (such as to immigration) in  his campaign announcement  that he comes from a different wing of the Republican Party than Trump.  Romney couldn't have chosen a better state to be an anti-Trump Republican than Utah.  Utah was one of Trump's worst state performances during the 2016 primary season. Trump garnered  just 14% of the vote  and finished in third place behind Ted Cruz and John Kasich. Along with Minnesota, it was the only state where delegates were assigned in a caucus or primary (not a convention) in which Trump finished below second place. In no other state did Trump garner less than 20% of the vote.  Republican dislike of Trump in the state translated to the general election. In the  28 states with an exit poll , Trump's performance among Utah Republicans was by far the worst among Republicans. He won a relatively low  64% of Utah Republicans . In the average state, Trump won 88% of Republicans. Besides Utah, he never won less than 84% of Republican voters.  And don't forget that  Evan McMullin's longshot independent bid  for President in 2016 was largely centered on Utah. Of course, it's not just the fact that Utah Republicans aren't the biggest fans of Trump that makes the state friendly territory for Romney. It's that Utah is heavily Republican. Over the course of 2017, Republicans and independents who lean Republican made up 57% of Utah adults in  Gallup polling . Democrats and independents who lean Democratic made up only 29% of Utah adults. That 27 percentage point Republican lead was just behind Wyoming and North Dakota for the most Republican states in the nation.  Romney's path becomes clear when you realize the disparity between how Republican Utah is and how it feels about Trump. When you compare Trump's net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating) with the Republican margin in party identification, Trump is really underperforming.  Trump had a net approval rating of just +1 percentage point in Utah during 2017,  according to Gallup . That's a 26 percentage point difference with the Republican party identification edge. And while Trump tended to underperform the party identification in most states, he averaged just a 9-point difference. The 26-point gap in Utah was the largest of any state.  Indeed, there's little sign that Trump has made Utah any less Republican. Romney has led heavily in  surveys taken of the race .  Anti-Trump Republican John Curtis  won a primary and  a general election  in a special House election in Utah in late 2017. The bottom line is that Romney is running in the perfect state to be a anti-Trump Republican. He's in a strong position to take advantage of the the fact that 39% of Utah voters held an unfavorable view of both Hillary Clinton and Trump in 2016. No other state came anywhere close to as many people disliking both of them.  CORRECTION: This story has been updated to note that Utah is behind only Wyoming and North Dakota as the most heavily Republican states.","articles_date":"17 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/17\/politics\/utah-romney-perfect-anti-trump\/index.html","articles_title":"Romney picked the perfect state to be an anti-Trump Republican","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":231,"issue":8,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) A student who witnessed Wednesday's massacre at a Florida school made a direct plea to lawmakers on Thursday to take action, warning more children will die otherwise. \"Some of our policymakers and some people need to -- they need to look in the mirror and take some action because ideas are great but without action, ideas stay ideas and children die,\" Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School senior David Hogg told CNN's \"New Day.\" At least 17 people were killed Wednesday afternoon when, authorities say, a  19-year-old former student opened fire at the Parkland school  near Fort Lauderdale.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0introduced his Democratic counterpart,\u00a0Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, before a speech Monday morning that\u00a0Schumer gave at the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville.  At the top of his speech, Schumer presented McConnell with a bottle of bourbon that was made in Brooklyn, where Schumer was born and raised. \"I'm sure he'll never agree that New York bourbon even counts as bourbon,\" Schumer quipped.  Toward the end, the McConnell\u00a0Center\u00a0presented Schumer with a clock that has the\u00a0university's emblem\u00a0on it.\u00a0\"Story of my life: Mitch gets the bourbon, I get the clock,\" Schumer\u00a0joked. It's not unusual to see the two men together. They speak on a near daily basis on the Senate floor when they each deliver their opening remarks, and they are frequently involved in negotiations over legislative action that takes place on the floor.  But it's not a common sight to see them \"take this show on the road,\" as McConnell teased at one point. While the two men acknowledged their differences, they attempted to keep the message focused on the recent  two-year budget deal  they struck and the upcoming immigration debate this week on the Senate floor.  The Senate will vote Monday night to  open up debate on a bill that will serve as the main vehicle for immigration legislation.  Members can propose amendments to the bill, but they must get at least 60 votes to pass -- a high hurdle that will require some bipartisanship, as the chamber is currently split 51 Republicans to 49 senators who caucus with the Democrats.  Schumer gave McConnell credit for holding an open floor debate on immigration,\u00a0and he\u00a0framed the Senate as the best chance to carry out \"the business of the country,\" describing the House as too \"fractious\" and saying with a shrug \"the President is the President.\"  He urged Trump to \"lead in a\u00a0bipartisan way\" and recalled his own involvement in the \"Gang of Eight\" immigration bill, saying many of the policies that people currently want were in that bill.\u00a0 Schumer,\u00a0however, didn't hold back in his criticism of the other senator from\u00a0Kentucky, Rand Paul. He was asked during a Q&A portion by a member of the audience about Paul's  opposition to the massive spending bill , which is expected to add to the deficit.  He said Paul's\u00a0concerns about fiscal\u00a0responsibility \"ring very hollow\" because he\u00a0supported the tax bill that also increases the deficit. \"If you're a deficit hawk, you got to be a\u00a0deficit\u00a0hawk all the way through,\" Schumer said.  Asked about Democratic strategy for the 2018 midterms, Schumer said his party can't rely solely on public resistance to the President.  \"Our mistake, I think, you cannot just run against Donald Trump. It is the job of we Democrats to put together a strong cohesive economic group of proposals aimed at the middle class,\" he said, pointing to a rollout of policy proposals Democrats have been making since last summer.  This was the second time the McConnell Center has had both Senate leaders on the stage. The last time was in 2007 when former Sen. Harry Reid was a McConnell Center guest. When McConnell introduced Schumer, he said the center has had many interesting guests over the years but \"none more interesting than our guest this morning.\" The two men argued that their relationship was closer than it appears. \"We're kind of like the offensive and defensive coordinators,\" McConnell said, joking that offensive\u00a0coordinator is a better position. \u00a0 \"Robust debate is not unusual,\" McConnell continued. \"But at every critical moment in this country, we've come together to do what is needed to be done to move the ball down the field.\" \"We really do get along despite what you read in the press,\" Schumer said.   There was no mention of Schumer voting against McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, in her nomination to become\u00a0transportation\u00a0secretary early last year, which was seen in the media as a major sign of partisanship in the immediate aftermath of Trump's election. Nor was there in-depth discussion of the all-consuming legislative battles that rocked Capitol Hill in recent years.  Weighing in on what he sees as shared value with McConnell, Schumer said both men consider it their jobs to unify their respective members.    \"We have very diverse parties, he has a Susan Collins and Ted Cruz. We won't say Rand Paul, we're in Kentucky,\" Schumer said to laughs. \"I have Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin.

We have got the two-minute warning.  The West Virginia Democratic senator. Senator, good to have you.  Do you think that this -- there will be rapid progress on this investigation, especially with Mueller in charge here?  SEN. JOE MANCHIN, D-WEST VIRGINIA: I do.  That was the indication. We just came out of a briefing. I think Director Rosenstein was very clear that Mr. Mueller has unfettered access that he can do and run this investigation the way he chooses. He will have the resources to do it and he thinks it's going to get going real quickly and it will be well-done.  CAVUTO: Do you get a sense, though, as we wait, that the president is stymied by this, though, Senator, that this could be such a huge distraction, it could be, as someone was saying, a summer bummer?  MANCHIN: Neil, we already have one heck of a distraction going on now.  CAVUTO: Right.  MANCHIN: I would think that, as the president and the White House, having someone the stature as Bob Mueller would get this done in an expedited matter, get -- unturn all of the stones, if you will, see everything, and let's move on and do the business of this country.  I would think they would want to get this done, Neil.  CAVUTO: All right, very quickly, we're also learning the markets were down a little bit today, Senator. But there is a fear that tax cuts, any of that stuff could be significantly delayed.  Do you agree with that? MANCHIN: It's a shame. It's a shame, Neil, on that. That's something we -- you know, we need infrastructure. Infrastructure is going to have to have a tax overhaul. We have a $20 trillion debt we have got to deal with. These are things that can be done. We have got health care we have got to deal with. These are all things that are fixable. And we can do it if we work together as Americans and quit fighting each other about being a Democrat and Republican and quit all the other crap.  There's not going to be a witch-hunt, I can assure you. I will not partake in anything such as that. I'm on Intel Committee. We are going to find the facts out and go whatever the intel and facts take us to the truth. We have confidence in Mueller.  I think that Rosenstein is a very dedicated, tough professional. So, let these people do their job and let's work with them.  CAVUTO: Senator, Claire McCaskill -- I think it was Claire McCaskill -- was not a big fan of the possibility of Joe Lieberman being the next FBI director, that a politician or someone who had elected office shouldn't be considered for that job. What do you say?  MANCHIN: Well, let me just say this, Neil.  Joe Lieberman is an absolutely wonderful human being. He's my dear friend.   OK? And I think the world of Joe Lieberman.  And I would just subscribe right now during these times exactly what Lindsey Graham said. Maybe it should have someone that has no political connections whatsoever, someone comes out of the professional ranks. Maybe that's where they should go.  But let me be very clear. If they don't, and Joe Lieberman is the man, I'm going to vote for him.  CAVUTO: So, if he is, and even though that's not your choice, it's someone who have -- from a political background, you would still support whatever he wants to do?  MANCHIN: I know Joe Lieberman.  CAVUTO: OK.  MANCHIN: There's not a finer human being than Joe Lieberman. OK?  With that, also, I agree with Lindsey Graham. The difficult times we're in, the challenging times we're in, if they can find that person, if they can pull that Bob Mueller out of the ranks of the professions that doesn't lean right, left, you don't know whether they're Democrat or Republican, that's probably what we need right now.  CAVUTO: Yes.  MANCHIN: But that's not my call to make.  And I will -- and the only thing I have said, if Joe Lieberman is there, his friend Joe Manchin, who knows him very well, is going to be with him.  CAVUTO: You know, yesterday, or this morning, sir, the president said -- tweeted out that this is the single greatest witch-hunt of a politician in American history.  What did you think of that?  MANCHIN: I will have to disagree.  I can only -- I can only speak about the people I know and how they're talking.  CAVUTO: All right.  MANCHIN: And I don't see anybody, I haven't seen anybody with -- all lathered up, if you will, it's a witch-hunt, and we're going after them.  CAVUTO: OK.  MANCHIN: I don't see that.  CAVUTO: All right, Senator, thank you very much. MANCHIN: Thank you, Neil.

Rand Paul told CNN Monday. \"So far the Senate leadership is not negotiating with our office,\" Paul said in an interview on CNN's \"Newsroom.\" \"I'm trying to negotiate with the President, but really the President is going to have to tell leadership it's going to have to negotiate with some of us who don't see this bill as being good for the country.\" The Kentucky senator said he spoke to President Donald Trump on the phone over the weekend to discuss the Senate's health care proposal. Paul has publicly opposed the bill in its current form  along with Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah, and Dean Heller of Nevada , who has become the target of  a critical advertisement  from the pro-Trump group America First Policies.  Three more Republican senators -- Susan Collins of Maine, Rob Portman of Ohio and Mike Rounds of South Dakota -- have expressed concerns about the bill; and four others -- Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia -- have made specific demands for changes.  To pass the bill, the GOP can lose only two senators. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not immediately respond to request for comment. Paul spoke to the push for a rapid turnaround on the Senate's proposal, which McConnell has said he wants to vote on  before July 4 . Paul said he has not yet finished reading the Senate's  newest draft of the bill , released Monday. \"I think it's a lot to digest in one week, not only to read the bill, but we don't even have the CBO score until this afternoon,\" Paul said. The  Congressional Budget Office released the score  minutes later, estimating that the Senate bill would leave 22 million fewer Americans with health insurance by 2026 than would be covered by Obamacare. Paul said he thought the bill would keep too many provisions of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature health care law, in place.  \"We keep 10 or 12 of the Obamacare regulations,\" Paul said. \"I'm concerned that the death spiral of Obamacare may get even worse in the Republican version.\" The Kentucky senator told CNN in a separate interview that he would not support the bill until he is convinced it would actually lower premiums. In an  interview with CNN on Monday , Josh Holmes, McConnell's former chief of staff and campaign manager, affirmed his faith in the majority leader's ability to get the bill passed. \"He keeps a close watch on his fellow senators and makes observances about what they need,\" Holmes said. When asked Monday what he thinks of a potential vote Tuesday on a motion to proceed to the bill, Johnson expressed skepticism. \"If leader McConnell says failure is not an option, don't set yourself up for failure,\" he said.

President Trump is telling Congress, Do your job, get to work on passing historic, Reaganesque tax reform that the American people voted for and they will benefit from. Now, tonight on this program, we will offer up solutions and we will explain why this is needed now more than ever. And more importantly, we will continue to hold Washington accountable. And that is tonight's important \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, President Trump is pushing for sweeping tax cuts and major tax reform. Why? To unleash the American economy and provide relief to the American people. Why? Because millions of Americans desperately need the health and the growth of the economy.  Now, the president sat down with a group of bipartisan lawmakers at the White House earlier today, and here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have four principles for tax reform. Make the tax code simple and fair. Cut taxes substantially. It'll be the largest tax decrease in the history of our country for the middle class. Encourage companies to hire and grow in America, and by doing that, we're going to have to reduce the taxes for companies. TRUMP: Another bipartisan project that is urgently needed is infrastructure and infrastructure investment.  TRUMP: It's time now to build new roads, new bridges, airports, tunnels, highways and railways all across our great land.  TRUMP: We don't want to forget DACA. And it's already been a week-and-a-half and people don't talk about it as much. We want to see if we can do something with regard to immigration, with regard to the 800,000 people that are now -- young people. They're not children anymore. They were children. Now they're young people. But we want to see if we can do something in a bipartisan fashion.  TRUMP: We want to get our country working again and competing again worldwide. And there'll be nothing that can stop us. (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: Now, notice, but for DACA, the president was echoing everything he promised you in the campaign. Now, the president also wrote on Twitter earlier today, \"The approval process for the biggest tax cut and tax reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast, Congress.\" And he added, \"With Irma and Harvey devastation, tax cuts and tax reform is needed more than ever before. Go, Congress, go.\" Now, President Trump is right. The time for tax reform is right now. We did not do this since 1986! And tonight, the president dined with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.  Here's what's happening. Look, the president is reaching across the aisle to try and get things done because, let's face it, Republican leadership in Congress -- they have failed miserably and at every turn. Now, Republican failure -- they've broken promises. They have now left the president with no other option if he's going to keep his promises to the American people. They have proven themselves to be incompetent, ineffective. And the president -- frankly, I don't blame him -- he's done waiting and he's forging ahead with or without Mitch McConnell. We'll have more on him in just a second. But first, let's look at some of these statistics on how massive and how burdensome this tax system in this country has now become. Now, according to Republican members on the House Ways and Means Committee, the current federal tax code -- look at this, over 70,000 pages! Who could ever comprehend that? Now, put that in perspective for you -- back in 1913, when the income tax was introduced, it was only 400 pages long. Now, the Tax Foundation also has an estimate that Americans spent 8.9 billion hours in tax preparation last year! And that translates to over $400 billion in lost productivity. Now, the president understands this all has to change, because unlike the vast majority of politicians in the swamp and the sewer and the so-called policy wonks in D.C., well, the president -- he's actually run a business. And here's what the president has been calling for. Pay close attention. He wants bold tax cuts and tax reforms. He wants an emphasis on benefiting the middle class, including middle class tax cuts. He wants seven brackets to go to three brackets to make it easy and simple. He wants that 15 percent corporate tax rate. Why? Because that makes American businesses more competitive on the global stage.  And of course, he's been talking about allowing multi-national corporations -- what? To repatriate trillions of dollars that they have sitting overseas at a low rate. And that way, they can invest in American workers and build factories and manufacturing centers right here in Michigan, in Wisconsin and Ohio and Pennsylvania. And of course, he's also pushing energy independence. Why? Because there are literally millions of high-paying career jobs available. And the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin -- he's saying the administration wants to make these tax cuts retroactive. Wow! People start spending money. Texas Senator Ted Cruz -- who will join us in just a minute -- he's also offering up his own tax reform plan. Now, here's the senator explaining today what you, the American people, need and why you need tax reform. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: Our economy since World War II has grown on average 3.3 percent a year. And yet for the past eight years, we've been mired in stagnation.  CRUZ: From 2008 to 2012, the economy grew on average 0.9 percent a year. CRUZ: Ronald Reagan was elected on a promise of tax cuts, of tax reforms. We saw historic tax reform in '81 and '86. And by the fourth year of Reagan's presidency, 1984, we went from stagnant economic growth, less than one percent a year, to 7.2 percent a year -- massive, booming growth lifting millions out of poverty, increasing significantly median incomes! (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: Senator Cruz is right. In the Reagan years, Reagan went from 70 to 28 percent top marginal tax rates in this country. OK, how did it result? Government doubled the revenues that they had in eight years, 20 million new jobs were created.  And by the way, Here are the highlights of what Senator Cruz is proposing. This makes perfect sense, and it's simple and it's easy and it's basic and it's fundamental. A low flat tax rate, tax returns that can be filed on a postcard, immediate expensing for businesses, a low corporate tax rate, repatriation, ending the death tax, getting rid of the alternative minimum tax.  Now, President Trump and Senator Cruz's philosophy on tax reform is simple. They want to get the government off your back and let you keep more of your hard-earned money in your wallet, spend it the way you want. And as we've been seeing, President Trump is working nonstop. He wants to get his major agenda items passed with members of Congress, meeting with them day and night and by taking his message on the road and speaking directly to the American people.  Now it's time for Congress. I cannot believe they have no urgency. Get your job done! And I'm specifically talking about, you, Senator Mitch McConnell and the never-Trumpers out there like, let's see, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake -- oh, Ben Sasse. We'll add him to the list. You know what? It's now or never. And by the way, no more excuses as to why you can't keep your promises. Oh, it's so hard! Well, for seven-and- a-half years, you promised to repeal, replace ObamaCare, and you couldn't get it done.  No more blaming the president like Mitch McConnell did last month, and he said the president had excessive expectations, and well, he doesn't understand the parliamentary procedures and the difficulties of legislation because he's never done this before. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, AUG. 7) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., MAJORITY LEADER: Now, our new president has, of course, not been in this line of work before and I think had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: That's so pathetic! That's the swamp! That's the sewer! And now, according to Roll Call, Senator McConnell is now saying tax reform may have to wait until next year? This is pathetic! It's inexcusable! It's unacceptable! Why did we elect you?  Now, it's time for an ultimatum. Senator McConnell, other Republicans, if you don't get the urgency to work for the American people, if you don't pass tax reform by the end of this year, you need to resign, go home, play golf, and get out of the way and let's get people in those positions that can serve the American people.  I'm tired of the complacency and business as usual. You know what? It's not been working. Congress is now failing the American people -- 50 million Americans in poverty, 50 million on food stamps, 90-plus million out of the labor force, lowest home ownership rate in 51 years. Really?  This is why, Congress, you have an approval rating that hovers around 15 wonderful percent. It's why Mitch McConnell has a dismal 18 percent approval rating in his own home state of Kentucky! Now, instead of whining and complaining and pointing fingers about why you can't pass legislation, you people in Washington and Congress, time to roll up your sleeves, get in a room -- I'll send you pizza and beer -- and turn off the air conditioner, like our framers and founders, and get to work and don't leave the room until you build consensus to help people. You know what? It's not like these issues or ideas are new. Just like with ObamaCare. What have you been doing? You've been promising and promising and running and elect us and elect us. The American people -- you've been doing this for years! And you know what? You said you're going to do this. You said you'll cut taxes. You said you'll pass reform. You said you'll repeal and replace. Where is your sense of urgency? Every American I know has a sense of urgency on their job. Where's your accountability? Now, the president can't do everything on his own. You need to hold up your end of the bargain. You need to accomplish something for once! Here with reaction, Texas senator Ted Cruz. Senator, are my expectations out of whack? SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: Sean, you're exactly right. Your expectations are what the American people are rightly demanding. We need to get the job done. We've got a mandate, an overwhelming victory from the voters in November. They've given us a Republican president, Republican heads of every agency and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. We don't have any more excuses. We need to get the job done. And the big four that we promised the American people is repeal the train wreck that is \"Obama care.\" We've got to get that done. Major tax cuts, major tax reform -- we got to get that done. Regulatory reform, getting Washington off the backs of small businesses and job creators. And confirming constitutionalists to the U.S. Supreme Court and the federal courts. If we do those four, this could be the most productive Congress in decades. And if we don't do any of them, it will be a heartbreaking missed opportunity. HANNITY: Listen, I see that your plan and the president's plan are almost identical. I can live with either one and the American people would benefit. You add energy independence to that.  CRUZ: Absolutely. HANNITY: You're right about justices. You build 400 miles -- 300 miles of the wall. You show you're getting that job done. And Republicans can have the best year they ever dreamed of in 2018! CRUZ: Yes. HANNITY: But it's not happening. And I -- do you agree that the Republicans, especially in the Senate, have pushed the president into the arms of the Democrats now, and he's got to look for alternates? CRUZ: Well, look, I think the president is frustrated. I think the American people are frustrated because we're not getting the job done. On \"Obama care,\" we came one vote short. It was beyond -- it made your head explode. But let me tell you, on \"Obama care,\" we're going to get the job done. I believe failure is not an option. I've told Mitch McConnell, I've told other senators we need to keep at it until we honor that promise, and critically, we lower premiums and give people more choices, more options, put you in charge of your health care. On tax reform, we've got to do it. And what the president just said that you aired earlier on the show, simple and fair. Put it on a postcard. Get rid of those 9 billion hours that we waste filling out forms, paying accountants, paying lawyers. Make it simple, fair and focus on jobs.  HANNITY: All right... CRUZ: Let small businesses create more jobs, raise wages. If we get the economy booming, we cut taxes, repeal \"Obama care,\" we'll have a terrific election in 2018. If we don't get any of it done, we'll have a terrible election in 2018! HANNITY: Senator, here's your plan. Now, it's what I've been saying. It's what the president has been saying. It's simple! Give the middle class a tax cut, corporate tax cuts, repatriation, file on a postcard. I agree with you 100 percent. And you add that to energy jobs and you've got millions of Americans now working. And you got money flowing in to Washington. You guys will have more money than you ever dreamed of. And Newt Gingrich told me he thinks it's about a 50 percent shot we get that done. Those aren't great odds to me. CRUZ: Well, and let me emphasize a couple of points from the tax speech I gave today. Number one, the president said today he wants a big, big tax cut. There's some Republicans in Congress that are talking about making tax reform revenue-neutral. Revenue-neutral means they're not cutting taxes. They're just moving money around from one bucket to another. We don't need revenue-neutral. We need a big tax cut on you, on families who are struggling, on small businesses. We need a Reaganesque tax cut that unleashes incredible growth. And I laid out today how we do it. We do that under the budget rules by having a 30-year budget window, which means we can have a big tax cut that isn't revenue-neutral that lasts for 30 years and unleashes booming growth. Let me make a second point, which is something I called for today, which is total expensing, immediate expensing of capital expenditures. What that does, if you're a farmer, it lets you buy a new tractor. If you're a steel worker, it lets the company invest in a new steel factory. If you're a truck driver, it lets you buy a new truck. We care about jobs here in America, Main Street jobs, manufacturing jobs, union jobs, blue-collar jobs. Immediate expensing unleashes incredible growth. I think that's a very important part of tax cuts and tax reforms that we're pushing forward. HANNITY: Senator, you mentioned that you still think the window's open on health care. One of the proposals -- and as a conservative, I always kind of like the idea of sending stuff back to the states... CRUZ: Absolutely. HANNITY: Lindsey Graham has that proposal. I talked to Dave Brat and I talked to Mark Meadows. They support it, but they said the devil is in the details.  CRUZ: Sure. HANNITY: Something that could work, is that maybe the alternate, maybe you get it done by the 30th using reconciliation or considering reconciliation? CRUZ: I think Lindsey Graham's proposal could easily be part of the solution. I am a big, big believer in federalism, sending things to the states, empowering the states. You know, that's something -- if Lindsey's proposal brings a few moderates on board, great. And let different states have different approaches. Let a John Kasich in Ohio have one approach, and let a conservative like Greg Abbott in Texas have a different approach. That's why we've got 50 states. HANNITY: Absolutely. CRUZ: And... HANNITY: That's why I'll move to Texas. CRUZ: ... and I think we're close on ObamaCare. You know, I think we're --  HANNITY: I'm -- Senator, I want to say one last thing. I don't -- I'm really -- like, I can't tell you the type of feedback I'm getting from my audience in radio and TV. They are livid! They're apoplectic. And I will say this. You -- on health care, you keep saying on the economy, Keep your promises. The Freedom Caucus is working day and night with you and together to keep their promises. If these guys don't wake up, you're the only few people I trust in Washington now. It's really despicable. CRUZ: Well, Sean, the role I'm trying to play is do everything I can to help and encourage the president to go in a positive direction, not a negative direction, and to bring Republicans together, talking to conservatives and moderates and leadership and the president and the administration saying, Everyone, look, if we do our job, just keep our word, the economy booms... HANNITY: That's it. CRUZ: ... we see more jobs. And that's a win-win for everyone! HANNITY: Why does it have to be so hard?  CRUZ: Yes. HANNITY: Senator, I do appreciate you keeping your promises. It means a lot to us. Thank you.  And when we come back, Dr. Sebastian Gorka calling out the D.C. sewer, swamp. He's next. Later, Hillary Clinton still blaming -- on the blame game book tour! You're going to see Lanny Davis try to defend that and much more straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Former deputy assistant to the president Dr. Sebastian Gorka had an interesting message for D.C. Republicans in a recent LA Times interview. Now, just take a look at the title of the piece. Sebastian Gorka says the GOP did not win last November, Donald Trump did. He joins us now to explain what he meant. He's also the author of \"Defeating Jihad.\" Dr. Sebastian Gorka, certainly, I would argue the president, and even today, was on message with the promises he made. To me, the Republican Party has no identity right now. They're not fighting for anything that they promised. You agree? SEBASTIAN GORKA, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely. Look, the president won the election. The rank outsider, the man who was anti-establishment as far as the right is concerned and the left is concerned -- he won an agenda of make America great again, not make the Republican Party great again.  And the sad thing is, Sean -- and this is the wakeup call and this is why he met with Schumer and Pelosi last week -- the GOP doesn't understand. It isn't the Republican Party that won last November the 8th. It is a New York real estate billionaire who won. And there's a reason for that, because they haven't served the nation's interests for more than a decade. HANNITY: You know, look, let's be honest here. Pelosi and Schumer -- they hate him, too. GORKA: Right. HANNITY: And they're political opportunists. And come 2020, there will be nothing he did that they're going to like and they will support the Democrat. Knowing the president as well as I do, I suspect, knowing Donald Trump, that he's basically sending a loud message, Get your act together or I'm going to find another way. I still think there's time and hope, but probably, the time is getting short now. HANNITY: You're absolutely right. This is the man who closes the deal. And he sent a very clear message. The viewers need to understand -- I saw a lot of stuff on social media that the president has caved and he's giving in to the Democrats. The opposite is true. He will keep to his agenda. That's the message he sent me the day after I left the White House. He said, I'm staying on the agenda, and I'd like you to help me. And I said, I'm going to help you.  He's not going to give up. But if he has to work with somebody else to get things done, he's going to do that, Sean, because he is results-oriented. And he doesn't matter... HANNITY: You know --  GORKA: He doesn't care -- it doesn't care whether he's got an R behind your name or a D behind your name. He wants to make America great again. HANNITY: Is this statement true, that Republican inaction and failure and lack of vision and lack of urgency has pushed Donald Trump into the arms of Democrats? Is that a true statement? GORKA: I think it misrepresents what he wishes to do. He hasn't -- he hasn't pushed -- this was his call. They didn't invite themselves to the Oval Office. The president of the United States invited them. And you know, they say -- some people said he was firing a shot across the bow of the GOP. Wrong. Donald J. Trump fired a torpedo into the hull of the GOP to say, Guys, wake up. HANNITY: Wake up. GORKA: I'm serious... HANNITY: Wake up. GORKA: ... about what I want to do. HANNITY: Oh, listen, I think his more important issue is serving the American people. He's got to fulfill his promises, whether they do or not. Dr. Gorka, great insight. Always good to see you, my friend. Thanks. GORKA: Thanks, Sean. HANNITY: When we come back, Hillary Clinton continues -- we're now up to 42 specific excuses, blaming everyone but herself for her election loss. You don't want to miss this. Lanny Davis, Caley McEneny (ph) will debate and face off. A \"Hannity\" shoot-out straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (NEWSBREAK) HANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" So Hillary Clinton continues to blame everyone and anything for her loss in 2016 in the election except, of course, herself. Now, earlier today during an interview with Matt Lauer, Clinton refused to take any responsibility for losing! Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT LAUER, NBC NEWS: When it comes to the self-inflictd wounds, when you look at the list of them -- and you go through them in the book -- did you make enough mistakes yourself to lose the election without any of the other things you talk about? HILLARY CLINTON, D-FMR. PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, I will say no, Matt. I don't think that will surprise you. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: No, Matt, I didn't do anything! And there's more. So while Hillary Clinton won't take responsibility for her loss, she is more than happy to blame the left-wing destroy Trump establishment media. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: I don't think the press did their job in this election, with very few exceptions. The other guy's running a reality TV show, which is, like, hard to turn away from. And whatever he says, we think it's kind of goofy, but hey, it's good TV. And she's over there, saying, OK, here's how we're going to raise taxes on the wealthy. And here's what we're going to do to close loopholes and here's where I think I can do it. And you know what? She's going to win anyway. So let's cover the other guy because he's a lot more fun. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Talk about denial. Here with reaction, RNC spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany is with us, and former special counsel to President Clinton, probably Hillary's best friend, Lanny Davis.  All right, Lanny, I'm going to go as fast as I can. Sexism, racism misogyny, xenophobia, suburban women, Comey, FBI, Russia, Putin, WikiLeaks, DNC, Obama, Biden, Sanders, Weiner, Electoral College, polling data, cable news, New York Times, fake news bots, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, TV executives -- I'm keeping going here -- anti-American forces, Democratic documentaries, low-information voters, people wanting change, people that assumed she'd win, of course the Republican Party, contest forums in Macedonia, Infowars, Guccifer, D.C. leaks, Jill Stein, Bannon, voter I.D.'s, Chief Justice Roberts, Kris Kobach, Citizens United, and colluding Trump officials. Why isn't she on the list? And by the way, why isn't Trump on the list, because he beat her soundly?  LANNY DAVIS, TRIDENT DMG FOUNDER: I have no idea why you just read that list. But first off, good evening, Sean, nice to be with you. HANNITY: Just for your entertainment purposes.  DAVIS: I was entertained. But let's take the occasion for a historic moment, and that is there's something that Hillary Clinton and President Trump agree on, which Clinton has said publicly now. And that is the poor, I would say reckless judgment of James Comey. And I don't know whether he deserved to the fired because of the Russian investigation. That sounds like a poor decision by the president which led to the Mueller appointment, but I do think he should have been disciplined because of his recklessness and the way he handled Hillary's email investigation, and President Trump and his deputy attorney general agree with that statement. So let's start out on what we agree with.  HANNITY: All right, Lanny, this is what I love about you. I didn't ask you any of those questions.  DAVIS: I made you speechless. It's a historic moment.  HANNITY: I didn't ask you that question in any way, shape, matter, or form.  DAVIS: You did not.  HANNITY: And the fact that Comey exonerated Clinton before he even did the investigation is pretty amazing.  All right, Kayleigh, maybe you'll answer my question because Lanny has no desire to answer it. (LAUGHTER) KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC SPOKESPERSON: I'm ready to answer it. Yes, Sean, it's incredible. She blames Comey. As you point out, he exonerated her months before he had even interviewed her. Instead of blaming Comey, she should be crediting him with her evasion of just, but instead she blames him.  And let's just debunk this myth right now, Lanny. The \"New York Times\" Nate Cohn, obviously no friend of Republicans here, said I even question this so-called Comey defense because his poll showed the day the Comey came out with that announcment that Trump was winning by four points in Florida. Trump was already on the upswing. I would advise Hillary Clinton to take a self-reflective moment and blame herself for the election loss rather than some faux reasoning for James Comey. DAVIS: Of all people that Hillary Clinton will not be taking advice from, Kayleigh, with all due respect, is you.  MCENANY: Well, she'd probably be in 1600 Pennsylvania if she did. DAVIS: We do agree, and, Sean, I believe you agree, that when the deputy attorney general criticized Comey for poor judgment, for violating the rules, and that he deserved to be disciplined, I can show you data that on the day that Comey wrote his letter Hillary Clinton was ahead in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan but six to eight percentage points, and within two days of that letter, she plunged. So that's one answer. HANNITY: Lanny, I hate to say this, the emails she deleted were under subpoena. That would be obstruction. Mishandling of classified information, that's a felony. Destruction of classified information, top secret special access program information, that also is a felony. Hillary Clinton also has problems, $145 million dollars kicked back to the Foundation, destroying BlackBerries with hammers, BleachBit, acid washing, the emails that she did delete. DAVIS: I've heard you do this before. HANNITY: Lanny, you can laugh all you want. I would be in jail and Kayleigh would be in jail and you would be bailing us out because I'd make you. DAVIS: If you were right, Mr. Justice Hannity, of course. But there's a lot of disagreements between your accusation --  HANNITY: Now you're going to say Comey has exonerated her? DAVIS: Let me go back to answering your question and to respond to Kayleigh's comment. HANNITY: That would be a first. Go ahead. DAVIS: Hillary Clinton has said I take responsibility for my mistakes, and I made many mistakes. But on October 28th, she's winning by a substantial margin. It is a simple fact that the data cannot be disputed.  HANNITY: They're crimes.  DAVIS: I know that you conclude that, but you're not a jury.  HANNITY: Now you're going to rely on Comey to exonerate her.  DAVIS: But we are at least saying that the facts, the data shows on October 28th she wins. By October 30th, she's plummeted. And one thing happened, the reckless judgment of James Comey 10 days from an election violating all the rules. That's the singular event. But she has taken responsibility for her mistakes.  MCENANY: I just want to debunk one --  HANNITY: It's a crime, though. Go ahead.  MCENANY: It is a crime, you're right. And I just want to debunk one of the many things that Clinton has blamed really quick. She blames the media for covering her emails obsessively. Until about five weeks ago, I was a member of the so called mainstream media on every single night, and I can count on one hand, Sean, the number of times an entire segment was devoted to her emails. I can count that on one had.  HANNITY: Thanks for being with us. When we come back, more controversy brewing over at ESPN. One of their hosts not calling President Trump a white supremacist. Tomi Lahren, Gina Loudon, and Danielle McLaughlin all join us straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Now for months ESPN has faced criticism for mixing liberal politics and sports. And now one of its hosts under fire after she called President Trump a white supremacist.  On September the 11th, SportsCenter anchor Jemele Hill tweeted, quote, \"Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself with other white supremacists.\" ESPN did issue a statement reading in part \"The comments on Twitter from Jemele Hill regarding the president do not represent the position of ESPN. Now, we have addressed this with Jemele, and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate.\" No word if she will face any disciplinary action from ESPN.  Earlier today, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders responded. Here's what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think that's one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make, and certainly something I think it's a fire-able offense by ESPN.  (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Keep in mind only a few months ago Jemele Hill defended a Colin Kaepernick tweet and comparing, quote, \"Runaway slave patrols to police officers.\"  Here now with reaction, Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren, psychology expert Dr. Gina Loudon, and author, attorney, and political liberal analyst Danielle McLaughlin. Here's the most amazing thing, and I can't take it anymore, Danielle. I don't like that conservatives, that the president -- this is a lie. And this is a narrative that happens every two years and every four years. Republicans, conservatives, the president are racists, sexist, misogynistic. You know what, stop lying about who we are because none of us, Tomi, we're not racist, nor is the president, nor the people around him. And I'm not saying for this woman to be fire. I'm saying that the left does this every single election cycle. And I've never heard you say for them to knock it off.  DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, LIBERAL POLITICAL ANALYST: I'll say it right now, knock it official. I don't think it's fair for anyone to be characterizing the president that way. I think he gave folks a little bit of red meat with his on both sides comment in Christian, which he did, in fairness, walk back.  I will say, though, that the idea that someone from the White House podium calling for the firing of a private employee is ridiculous. Can you imagine if Josh Earnest had said Donald Trump shoud have been fired for the birther conspiracy from \"The Apprentice\"? I don't think that's the place of the White House.  But I will say that this is not a helpful comment.  HANNITY: Tomi, you understand this. Dr. Loudon, you understand this. As conservatives, they say one thing that is viewed over the line, and fire them, boycott them. Tomi?  TOMI LAHREN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it's happened at ESPN before. I think we remember what happened to Curt Schilling because of a post that he made on Facebook. Again, it was not on the channel, but his repercussions were far more strict than the little talking to that they gave the other host over at ESPN. And I can't help but think maybe there is a little double standard going, and maybe ESPN really values diversity, but not so much diversity of opinion. I think that sounds more correct to me. HANNITY: Dr. Loudon, isn't there something wrong if you're so willing to lie about other people? I'm leaning on your psychology background and your doctorate here.  DR. GINA LOUDON, PSYCHOLOGY EXPERT AND RADIO HOST: Yes, there's definitely something wrong with somebody who is going around name calling instead of acting professional. Having said that, she has the right to say it.  But here's the thing, Sean. It's as if ESPN doesn't realize that the Trump voter is their audience. If you look at the NFL players, you look at the PGA, the LPGA even, very frequent voters, very conservative people, and those are your ESPN viewers. And so if they were going to do anything with this particular commentator, they may want to think of replacing her just because she is bashing their own audience. This is why the left continues to lose, and this is why conservatives tend to build their numbers.  HANNITY: Dr. Loudon, I think we conservatives are far more tolerant of freedom of speech, expression, and thought. I don't do boycotts and I don't call for firings. Imagine if a conservative had said whatever similar during the Obama years. What would the reaction be? LOUDON: Well, there's always a hypocrisy, Sean, and we're used to it. But here's the good news. You watch this decay of the leftist media over the last eight to 10 years as they continue to spout their bigotry and to be so intolerant. And it's left a really good place for conservative media, and conservative media is continuing to fill those voids. I like to say that every time the left spouts their mantra, another conservative gets their wings. And I really believe this is no exception to that.  (LAUGHTER) HANNITY: All right, it's a wonderful life, Dr. Loudon. Tomi, I assume, and I don't know for sure, I know I've been a target of all of this, and fire Hannity and boycott Hannity. And the left isn't really tolerant. I've seen horrible things about you and Dr. Loudon, myself on social media and by these groups that are funded seemingly from Soros type of people.  LAHREN: Of course. And I'm not someone that has gone to bat for what I believe in, I've had to feel the repercussions. So I'm not somebody that calls for boycott or calls for firings either, and I would never do that. I have been very vocal about that.  But I will say this, kind of what Dr. Gina was talking about there, the Trump voter is a sports watcher and we're folks that enjoy watching ESPN, love watching the commentary. And I wouldn't call for a boycott, I wouldn't call for a firing, but I would just say to ESPN, your numbers are not going to lie, because we're going to start turning off the TV. And that's how we're going to voice our opinion, that's how we're going to use our freedom of expression, our freedom of speech. So watch you. You might be losing a big chunk of your audience, and we're not going to feel bad for you when you do.  HANNITY: And, Danielle, last point to you. It hasn't been helping the NFL. Colin Kaepernick and all these players, it seems that a lot of people are reacting. Ratings are down from last year and last year was nodd not a good year for the NFL.  MCLAUGHLIN: I'm a free speech absolutist like many conservatives even though I'm not a conservative. And I think --  HANNITY: A lot of your fellow liberals are not. MCLAUGHLIN: Well, maybe that's a discussion for another day. HANNITY: Nobody defends me when I'm being boycotted from the left. Very few, Lanny Davis. MCLAUGHLIN: I don't think that if you hear something that you don't like, you should call for the firing of that person. That's one of the foundational values of this country. And I don't like it when it comes from the left or the right. On Colin Kaepernick, he has the free-speech right to protest, to take a knee, which I personally think is a very reverential thing to do obviously when you listen to the National Anthem. People have the right to like it, to not like it. His employers, a private entity, have the right to hire him or not. And maybe this is the free market talking, but I will defend his right to take that knee until my last breath.  HANNITY: It looks like the conservatives are the ones that are open- minded, the ones that believe in freedom. All right, guys, good to see you all. Thank you for being with us. When we come back, Daily Caller has a huge, explosive report about Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Shultz's former I.T. aide. They are reporting he tried to hide a secret server. This gets bigger every day. Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett, they're next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Luke Rosiak is an investigative reporter with The Daily Caller. There's an explosive report out today about Debbie Wasserman Shultz and her former I.T. staffer. Rosiak reports that, quote, \"Exclusive DWS I.T. guy was banned from House after trying to hide the secret server.\" Luke goes onto explain in the article, quote, \"Now indicted former Congressional I.T. aide Imran Awan alleged routed data from numerous House Democrats to a secret server.\" Fox News has not been able to independently verify this, but if that is true, that is beyond damning. Here with reaction, Fox News anchor, attorney, Gregg Jarrett, Circa News, Sara Carter. Gregg, if that's true, to me that means one thing, that there's a chance other countries could have been fed this information, that the security concerns we had may be real.  GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS ANCHOR AND ATTORNEY: Absolutely. He was downloading huge quantities of sensitive documents to a secret server. And that puts a lie to what Democrats including Debbie Wasserman Shultz have been claiming all along that there were no security breaches. Clearly there were.  It also suggests to me that this is a guy who probably is planning to flip, to implicate Democrats who were either wittingly or unwittingly complicit in his criminal activities. Why do I think that? Because his wife who is safely ensconced in Pakistan has now reportedly decided to turn herself in to American authorities. She wouldn't do that unless an immunity deal was in the works to implicate people like Debbie Wasserman Shultz. Now, did Russians actually hack our system? A senior investigative official said, does it mean that this guy sold the information to the Russians? I don't know. So, Sean, they're clearly looking at whether a Democratic insider is the one who gave the information to the Russians, not hacking at all. HANNITY: And add to that, Sara Carter, that Imran Awan actually took Debbie Wasserman Shultz's computer, left it in a place with a message for law enforcement, here, it's all here. I've got to believe Debbie Wasserman Shultz, I think that plea deal is coming. She's in trouble.  SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: Well, I have to believe something is coming because not only did Imran leave her laptop sitting there in that small room at the Rayburn office building, but he left a letter for the U.S. attorney. He left copies of his identification sitting all around. Luke was very detailed in this story on how this happened.  And just like Gregg said, Sean, these are huge national security implications. Imran Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, they moved data apparently, if this story is true, from protected servers of members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, to an offsite server that was connected to the House Democratic Caucus. And that could have been established right there. They could have put it within the server that's connected to the House Democratic Caucus, created a backdoor where they could infiltrate that system wherever they wanted.  And not only that, he created a Dropbox account where he put everything into this Dropbox account where he could access it after February 2nd when he was removed. And all of his trips to Pakistan for months at a time and having armored escort in Pakistan has to raise the suspicion that possibly Imran and his wife Hina Alvi are connected to Pakistani intelligence.  HANNITY: We're going to stay on this story. Nobody else in the media will dare touch it. I promise you we're ahead of the curve. Thank you both. Sara, Gregg, thanks. When we come back, our friends, our really good friends, Diamond and Silk, they get the final word tonight. You do not want to miss it. Hillary, I hope you're watching.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Tonight the conservative rock star group Diamond and Silk, they get the final word again. Watch this.  LYNNETTE \"DIAMOND\" HARDAWAY: Hey, Sean. Here is tonight's final word. Well, we know Hillary Clinton is on a book tour, but we call it a desperation tour.  ROCHELLE \"SILK\" RICHARDSON: Yes. HARDAWAY: Maybe she's trying to reinvent yourself. Oh, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary. Now she is out playing the blame game, bashing everyone in her sight. RICHARDSON: Yes. HARDAWAY: Saying woe is me. You did it to me. It's not my fault. Well, the buck stops with her. And you know what, Sean, she will go down as the most clueless politician in history because she didn't know her base. She didn't know how to stay on base, and she is way off base. Even Democrats said she will say anything to get a vote. And you know what we are finding out, Sean?  RICHARDSON: What? HARDAWAY: She will say anything to sell a book.  Now, Sean, that's our final word for tonight.  HANNITY: Our friends Diamond and Silk.  That's all the time we have left this evening. We hope you'll set your DVR, never miss an episode of \"Hannity.\" Don't forget, this show is not the establishment media. We are different. We're fair, we're balanced, and we're thankful that you are here every night. And we'll see you back here tomorrow. Thanks for being with us.

The Democratic underdog from El Paso outraised the first-term Republican senator and former presidential candidate by $1.5 million -- $2.3 million to $800,000 -- from the beginning of 2018 through mid-February. That impressive fundraising haul comes after O'Rourke also outpaced Cruz in the closing quarter of 2017, $2.4 million to $1.8 million. Cruz still holds a clear advantage in the race. When it comes to cash on hand, Cruz leads O'Rourke by a little more than $1 million. The Republican also has recent Texas electoral history on his side. Democrats haven't won a statewide election there since Bob Bullock's re-election as lieutenant governor in 1994. The last Democrat elected to the US Senate from Texas? Lloyd Bentsen in 1988. For Democrats to have a chance at taking control of the Senate, they may have to make states like Texas competitive. Democrats -- or independents who caucus with them -- are defending 25 seats this year, while Republicans are defending just eight. The GOP has a 51-49 advantage at the moment. Recent Democratic statewide hopefuls have struggled, including Wendy Davis, hailed as a rising star in the Lone Star State, only to lose the 2014 gubernatorial election to Greg Abbott by 20 points. O'Rourke is hoping to end the Democratic skid by running a different kind of campaign, embracing his punk rock roots. He's been traveling from one event to another in a car with aides, listening to Spotify and sharing it all with the world via Facebook and Twitter. O'Rourke has already visited 223 of the state's 254 counties, including some deep red turf. Another factor that could benefit O'Rourke this year is the fact Texas has three competitive House races in play, including John Culberson's Houston-area 7th District and Pete Sessions' 32nd District, which covers the northeastern Dallas suburbs. It's also worth keeping in mind that the increasingly diverse Texas is slowly becoming competitive. Hillary Clinton lost the state to Donald Trump in 2016 by 9 percentage points -- a margin on par with her defeat in Iowa, and just a single point wider than Clinton's loss in Ohio, a perennial presidential battleground state. Texans gave the President low marks for his first year in office, with 54% saying they disapproved of his job performance while just 39% said they approved,  according to Gallup . His approval there was lower than states such as Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which had closer margins than Texas in 2016. While the odds remain stacked against Democrats winning statewide in Texas this year, O'Rourke could give the party a fighter's chance -- especially if he's able to maintain his fundraising prowess.  For now, Texas moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican in our updated Senate race ratings.","articles_date":"4 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/27\/politics\/texas-senate-race-rating-likely-republican\/index.html","articles_title":"Senate Key Race alert: Texas is no longer Solid Republican","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":239,"issue":8,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Senate Republicans released their own version of a tax plan Thursday, and it varies just enough from the House's bill to set the two chambers up for a dramatic showdown over tax policy in upcoming weeks. The Senate tax bill includes more individual tax brackets than the House bill (seven instead of four) as well as fully repeals the state and local tax deduction, which has become a must-save item for moderate Republicans in the House. The House bill repealed the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes, but preserved the property tax deduction up to $10,000 to assuage concerns from New York and New Jersey Republicans. But the differences don't end there. While the House bill eventually repealed the estate tax in its entirety, the Senate bill won't repeal the tax, but instead will double the exemption meaning fewer families will pay it. The Senate bill also maintains a provision to allow individuals to write off medical expenses that exceed a certain amount of their income, something the House bill scrapped entirely. The issue has become a major flashpoint in the debate in the House. North Dakota Republican Sen. John Hoeven acknowledged Thursday that watching the fights play out in the House helped inform the Senate bill. \"Look, as we hear things from our constituents and analyze them, it's helped us,\" Hoeven said. Republican senators were briefed on their legislation Thursday morning, but an official plan and score of the Senate proposal wasn't released until Thursday evening. That plan also highlighted that while the Senate bill would reduce the corporate tax rate to 20%, the Senate will delay the implementation of the lower rate until after December 2018.  The Senate plan came as the House voted Thursday afternoon along party lines to pass their own bill out of the ways and means committee.  Most members emerging from the meeting said that the Senate bill was at the very least a step in the right direction. \"The conversation, the negotiation will continue until we arrive on consensus,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said of the initial plan he saw in the conference. \"This is an ongoing discussion.\" Still there is more work to do. While the Senate bill hits its spending target in the 10-year window of costing no more than $1.5 trillion, the bill will still have to be adjusted because the growing costs make clear it will add to the deficit outside the 10-year window. It's something Senate finance committee aides acknowledged Thursday, making clear more work needed to be done to ensure the proposal would be compliant with budget rules.  Under reconciliation rules, the special process that allows the Senate Republicans to pass the bill with just a simple majority, the Senate tax bill cannot add to the deficit after 10 years by even one cent. Republicans on both sides of the Capitol have laid out an aggressive timeline to pass their tax bills out of both chambers. The ultimate goal is to have a tax cut bill on the President desk before the end of the year. Senate Republicans unveiled their plan just days after Democrats swept state races in New Jersey and Virginia -- an election GOP members said was a wake-up call that their party needs to pass at least one major legislative accomplishment or else face electoral backlash in the midterms. \"If we don't produce, it'll get worse,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina told CNN. \"The antidote to this problem is to pass a tax cut that Americans believe helps them and their families, to replace a broken health care system with something better. And if we do those things, I think we'll do fine in the fall.\" RELATED: Republicans know Tuesday's elections had a message. They just don't know what it was. Senators are especially feeling the weight of the task ahead. Unlike the House where after fits and starts the party eventually came together to overhaul Obamacare, the  Senate failed to pass a repeal of the Affordable Care Act  this summer and members are emphatic that they cannot afford to be 0-2 heading into the 2018 midterms, no matter how good the map looks for them. Senators are constrained in a way that House tax writers technically aren't. Under Senate rules, the Senate finance committee must produce a tax plan that doesn't increase the deficit by any more than $1.5 trillion over the next decade.  That is part of the reason that Senate Republicans  are considering phasing in a new corporate rate  of 20% rather than starting it right off the bat, which is expensive. While President Donald Trump has been clear he wants to see a corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 20% immediately, the cost may be too great. \"We haven't made that decision ultimately on that delay,\" said South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. \"There's a lot of pressure to do it now.\" Some Senate Republicans Including Florida's Marco Rubio have also lobbied to increase the child tax credit to $2,000 up from the increase to $1,600 in the House bill. And Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has lobbied the committee not to fully repeal the estate tax, which the House bill repeals after 2023. \"The bill is going to be released either tomorrow or Friday. Until it is, I've been asked not to comment on the specifics,\" Collins said. \"But it certainly is true I've expressed reservations about having complete repeal of the estate tax.\" Another major change in the Senate bill could be a full repeal of  the state and local tax -- also known as SALT -- deduction . SALT, as it's known on Capitol Hill, became a major touchstone in the US House where more than a dozen Republicans from high tax states like New Jersey and New York fought to preserve at least a core part of the tax write off. After a handful of closed-door meetings in the House, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady announced he'd preserve the tax deduction for property taxes up to $10,000, but that deductions on income or sales taxes would be repealed. However, unlike the House where the GOP's majority is dependent on a handful of members from swing districts in blue states where property taxes are high, most of the Republican senators hail from lower-tax states that are more solidly Republican and less dependent on the SALT deduction. Still, House Republicans are warning that a full repeal of SALT could be trouble for passing the tax bill through the full Congress. \"I will be very clear. Repealing the state and local tax deduction is just not a policy that will make its way through the House side. The Senate indications that they may potentially do that, I just don't see how that math works to get to tax reform,\" said Rep. Tom Reed, a Republican from New York. Reed said he'd been talking to senators about the issue. \"I think it's very clear. You have 73 Republicans from the House that come from high-tax states. If you go down the path of trying to repeal the entire state and local tax in the Senate, than that is just not going to work,\" he said.  Adding to the complications for the Senate is the margins by which Senate Republicans have to pass a tax bill. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose two of his own senators if he is going to pass the bill along party lines.  There is some effort to bring Democrats on board,  but after a closed-door meeting  in the Library of Congress Tuesday afternoon between a handful of Democrats, White House legislative director Marc Short and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, Democrats were still waiting to see how the process would move forward before committing to sign on. During the meeting, Trump called in from Asia to try to sell Democrats on the plan, telling them he'd be a \"big loser\" if the GOP plan is signed into law. \"If they put this bill out Friday and then try to jam it on Monday, move it through ... it's not real bipartisanship,\" warned Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Overall, Republicans are still optimistic that they can shepherd their bill through committee and pass it on the floor.  \"I feel different than with healthcare,\" said Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran. \"That there's a greater likelihood that involves passage of tax reform.\" As to how they will settle what could be grave differences between the House and the Senate bill? \"I think this process is a healthy one. We're going to look to improve our bill at every step in the way. We hope the Senate passes their very best version of tax reform, as well,\" Brady told CNN's Phil Mattingly in an exclusive interview Wednesday. \"What I'm confident of (is) we will reconcile and find common ground in the end.\" This story has been updated and will continue to update with new developments.

Republicans released an updated version of their plan to repeal and replace Obamacare Monday afternoon. The newest draft -- which makes just minor changes to the original bill that was released Thursday -- includes a provision meant to incentivize individuals to maintain their health insurance care coverage regardless of whether they are sick. The newest plan would bar people from getting insurance for six months if they had a lapse in coverage for 63 days or more in the previous year. The provision wasn't included in the original version of the bill, but health care experts have warned that without some kind of continuous coverage incentive, the health care market could become unstable. The point is to make sure healthy people have insurance, which helps keep premium costs down. Many insurers have already made their decisions, letting state regulators know whether they'll participate and what rates they want to charge for 2018. A sizable number are asking for another round of steep rate increases. Others aren't even willing to return to the exchanges at all. Most insurers are citing the uncertainty emanating from Washington as a decisive factor in their decisions. When insurers don't know what the rules of the road will be for next year and beyond, it makes it very tough for them to commit to participating on the exchanges or to set rates. Insurers have until later this year to change their plans for 2018. Senate Republicans are expected to make additional changes to their health care bill throughout this week as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tries to find 50 senators to support his bill. Cornyn says vote 'this week'  Senate Republicans are expected to make additional changes to their health care bill throughout this week as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tries to find 50 senators to support his bill.   The Senate's No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, tweeted on Monday the Senate health care bill needs to pass \"this week\" before premium increases for next year are announced, a notable shift from comments he made Sunday where he described the \"drop-deadline\" for the legislation as August 1.  \"I am closing the door. We need to do it this week before double digit premium increases are announced for next year,\" Cornyn tweeted. Just 24 hours earlier from his comment, however, Cornyn described to reporters at a Koch Industries back Colorado Springs retreat the period around August 1 as the \"drop-deadline\" for the chamber to address health care. Cornyn, who is the Senate Majority Whip, said Sunday he'd worked the phones all weekend trying to win support for the Senate health care bill and was \"optimistic\" the legislation would pass. \"It's hard,\" he told a small group of reporters when asked how negotiations were going between sessions at the Koch retreat. \"But there's no excuse for failure. ... When people want to get to 'yes' you can have good faith negotiation and get them there ... But it's going to be close.\" He said at the time he'd been working with Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Dean Heller of Nevada to address their concerns about the supporting the bill. Obamacare in 2018: Many will pay the price of Washington's uncertainty Johnson expressed strong doubts Sunday that the legislation can make it through the chamber before the July 4 recess, as the GOP leadership wants. \"I would like to delay the thing,\" Johnson said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"There's no way we should be voting on this next week. No way.\" And Sen. Susan Collins allowed for the possibility that the Senate could work late during an open amendment process. \"It's hard for me to see the bill passing this week, but that's up to the majority leader,\" Collins said on ABC's \"This Week\" \"We could well be in all night a couple of nights.\" Timing in the House A senior House GOP leadership aide told CNN House Republican leaders continue to monitor Senate health care developments, and no decisions have been made about what the House will do when and if the Senate approves their bill. Leaders are reviewing next steps, including bringing their bill to the House floor for a vote shortly after the Senate acts.   \"We will continue to keep all options open at this point,\" the source told CNN. Once they do a whip check, House GOP leaders could also decide instead to go to conference on the two bills and negotiate a new version.  If House Republicans feel the pressure to move quickly on a Senate passed bill procedurally the House Rules Committee would need to meet to set the parameters for the debate before anything could go to the floor.

The Congressional Budget Office says watch a half-million jobs take a hike, so Senate Republicans just blocking a bill to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. To West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin who voted to advance that bill today. Senator, good to have you back. SEN. JOE MANCHIN, D-W.VA.: Hey, Neil. Good to be with you. CAVUTO: Where does this stand? I know Chuck Schumer was saying, we're going to keep trying it again and again and again. But what do you think? MANCHIN: Well, Neil, you know, if we're serious about raising the minimum wage, I'm serious. I want to give people a raise. I know about raising the minimum wage, you bring three million people off the food stamp rolls. That saves $4 billion a year. So, economically, it makes sense for our country. Next of all, people shouldn't work 40 hours and still be in poverty. And you know what? My friends on the Republican side and my Democrat colleagues, we agree on that. But to agree on how you implement it and where it starts, I think is where the breakdown is. Can we get enough people in the middle to come together and say, we're going to raise it off of $7.25 and start moving it up and then let basically inflation take over to where it's adjusted and take it out of the political arena? CAVUTO: Well, that would not be a bad idea, let it be adjusted to inflation. We can take this out of the whole, you know, political hot water here. MANCHIN: Yes. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: But I do hear from a lot of CEOs, and not just like The Gap CEO type of -- they can afford this. They're a big organization. MANCHIN: Sure. CAVUTO: Even if you're a large multinational concern, it's one thing, but if you're running a mom-and-pop pizza shop in New York or in West Virginia, it's a whole different story. Right? Why can't there be gradations of this? In other words, if we're going to do it, we even have different standards for different folks, different sized businesses. It seems to be with Harry Reid and all, it's all or nothing. Why? MANCHIN: Well, Neil, here's the thing. Let me talk about my little state of West Virginia. I'm proud of right now they voluntarily, the legislature and the governor voluntarily moved it from $7.25 to $8.75 over the next two years. So it will be a 75 cents increase next year and 75 cents after that. If West Virginia can do it, then I'm sure that the rest of the country can do it. And I think some states have already done it. CAVUTO: Well, no, but that's a big difference between West Virginian political leaders doing it and then businesses having to suck it up to do it. MANCHIN: Well, basically, we... CAVUTO: Well, you can bark out of the orders. MANCHIN: But, Neil... CAVUTO: If they don't have the -- if they have to cut back on personnel or not hire as many, then the reality for them is, they either automate their shops or they close their shops or they limit how many they are hiring for their shops. Right? MANCHIN: But, Neil, you know, we have had the minimum wage raised under Republicans and Democrats. CAVUTO: Absolutely. Absolutely. (CROSSTALK) MANCHIN: And you know what? It did not have the effect that we were told it was going to have if it's done in a responsible manner. CAVUTO: But I think you came on this show not too long ago admitting this was an anemic recovery. And now I'm hearing -- not you, but from Democratic strategists, who say don't even use the word recovery. So, is this the environment in which you want to be forcing businesses, who exactly aren't hiring gangbusters, to do more? MANCHIN: Neil, let me just say this. I'm talking to my friends on the Republican side, and I'm saying, can we find a pathway forward to give people a raise? Can we help? Can we find something that we can agree on and start moving? Right now, $10.10, it died. We don't have the votes for $10.10. One hundred percent of nothing is nothing. Can we move something forward? Can we do it to where we don't have the job loss? CAVUTO: Well, how about putting half that effort, Senator, into just finding jobs? Once they get in the door, then... MANCHIN: Oh, I agree. CAVUTO: ... we can debate finding them a higher wage or whatever. But I think we kind of get it backwards. And no offense to you, but I think that we're really just pushing this higher rate for people to get at work when there's so many people starving to work. MANCHIN: Neil, then on top of that, remember, we talked about the IRS giving bonuses to delinquent employees of the federal government of a million dollars. CAVUTO: Right. MANCHIN: It's just unbelievable, unbelievable. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: Well, that is what makes me think that a lot you guys, not you, of course, might be a bit tone-deaf, so that you don't see the reality that a lot of small, medium, and large business guys tell me every day... MANCHIN: Well, I'm a small business person. CAVUTO: ... that this is a burden for them and maybe what the better part of valor for now would be to focus on getting people a wage and getting a job and then, then if things pick up, then we can talk about increasing it. MANCHIN: Well, we have been -- Neil, the bottom line is things are moving forward, and basically prices are going up and we have got people getting further and further behind. But the bottom line is... CAVUTO: Well, but we have got people further and further behind on not getting a job, right? MANCHIN: Right. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: You keep extending unemployment benefits. I mean, when you talk about hiking the wage, we can never get past go on this, right? MANCHIN: Well, can we have a consideration with people coming into the work force for the first time? Should there be a consideration in a different rate for someone that is trying to raise a family on it and working full-time? CAVUTO: Right. MANCHIN: I think there's a proper way to move forward. We have just got to have the dialogue. CAVUTO: So, you're open to a two-tiered rate? MANCHIN: I'm open to... CAVUTO: In other words, it's not all or nothing? OK. MANCHIN: I'm open to everything, Neil. CAVUTO: All right. MANCHIN: I always have been. I want to give people a raise, and get them off the minimum wage. And I want to do it in a responsible manner that we don't jeopardize losing their jobs. CAVUTO: OK. I want them to get jobs. And what I then say is, I will go with you, Senator. (CROSSTALK) MANCHIN: I think we both want -- we both... CAVUTO: We will say, all right, now that you are in the door, we will talk about, if things pick up, giving you more once you are. But we will see. Senator, it's always a pleasure, sir. MANCHIN: Neil, thank you for having me.

They totaled close to $600,000 over a span of 20 years. The descriptions for the complaints included discrimination based on sex, age and disability, but there was no explicit mention of sexual harassment. There were also 10 additional settlements involving claims against non-member-led Senate offices, totaling $853,000. The Office of Compliance has previously said it considers sexual harassment under the category of sex discrimination. In a letter to Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, responding to his request for additional information, the compliance office said, \"Traditionally, the OOC has not separated allegations of sexual harassment from those involving sex-based disparate treatment or pregnancy discrimination.\"  \"In fact, for many years, the Office simply classified all claims alleging discrimination of any kind as civil rights cases without any further differentiation,\" the agency said in the letter. \"Thus, there are claims in our files that are classified in the category of 'civil rights' which may or may not contain an allegation of sex-based discrimination. Further, there are claims classified as sex discrimination which may not involve allegations of sexual harassment, such as claims of disparate treatment based on sex.\" That means it is impossible to determine from the the data released Thursday night whether there were any sexual harassment settlements reached in the Senate, or how much those settlements would have totaled. According to the OOC data, there were four sex discrimination-related settlements in the Senate.  Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, said in a statement releasing the information that \"Harassment in the workplace should not be tolerated under any circumstances, but particularly not in the United States Senate.\"  \"While the Rules Committee has been eager to provide this information in a transparent manner, it has been our priority to protect the victims involved in these settlements from further harm,\" Shelby said. \"I am pleased that we have received assurances from Senate Legal Counsel that the release of this data does not violate confidentiality and as such, are able to make it public.\" Not all settlements are handled through the Office of Compliance. For instance, one of the cases related to Rep. John Conyers, who resigned earlier this month, was settled outside of the compliance office process.  The information released Thursday night had not previously been made public. This lack of disclosure came to light this week following Kaine's formal request earlier this month to the Office of Compliance. Kaine asked for a release of records detailing the scope of sexual harassment complaints filed against Senate offices over the years. In a letter to the head of the office,  Kaine had asked for a release of records  detailing the scope of sexual harassment complains in the Senate, including the number of harassment claims filed over the last decade against senators and their staff; the number of claims that ended in \"some form of resolution\"; and the amount of each settlement paid out from a fund set up with taxpayer dollars. But in a response to Kaine's request, the compliance office's executive director, Susan Tsui Grundmann, wrote this week that a statistical breakdown was already shared with the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, and that any additional disclosure would invade \"strictly confidential records.\" Shelby's decision to not publicly disclose this information until now comes amid widespread and bipartisan calls across Capitol Hill in recent weeks for increased transparency on sexual harassment. It is also particularly notable given that the senator's counterpart in the House -- House Administration Committee Chairman Gregg Harper -- has released comparable information about sexual harassment settlements involving House offices over the years. According to Harper, he was informed by the Office of Compliance that there were three settlement payouts in the House  related to sexual harassment between 2008 and 2012 , totaling $115,000. And from 2013 to the present, Harper said there was just one sexual harassment settlement involving a House office for $84,000. Subsequently, this was revealed to have involved GOP Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas and a former aide who accused him of sexual harassment. Farenthold has said he will not seek re-election next year.","articles_date":"22 12 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/12\/21\/politics\/senate-sexual-harassment-settlement-information\/index.html","articles_title":"Senate committee releases settlement details from cases since 1997","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":243,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday  delayed a vote on the Senate health care bill  until after the July 4 recess, giving his caucus more time to negotiate changes to the proposal but leaving the GOP campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare in limbo.  Here's what happens next: Where Republicans stand:  GOP senators are back behind closed doors, trying to hammer out some kind of path forward.  What to watch Wednesday:  Nothing public of note -- keep gauging wary senators and trying to tap into the potential compromise agreements floating back and forth behind closed doors. The goal is to have a deal on a new draft by Friday, get it scored by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office next week and vote on it when they return from recess.  Getting a new bill done by Friday is an ambitious goal, that could very well slide, a senior GOP aide acknowledged to CNN.  The big question: What's going to change in three days -- or 13 days -- to make this happen? Senators are going to have to move away from firmly, publicly held positions if McConnell is ever going to get the 50 votes he needs to pass this legislation. Who is going to do it first?  President Donald Trump's role, as viewed from the Hill: \"He has his role. We have ours. There probably won't be much intersection,\" one senior GOP aide said after his boss came back from a White House meeting Tuesday. The point being: details and negotiating will be handled in house. The President \"will do social media and make big promises on TV.\"  Tuesday was the second straight meeting with GOP senators (the first one was with a smaller group a few weeks ago) where it was clear, at least to senators in attendance, the President wasn't read in on the in-the-weeds details and concerns of individual members, according to two people with direct knowledge of the meeting.  Those people described it as a good meeting -- one in which the President mostly listened, talked about the promises made to constituents and the need to add some money to the bill. When lawmakers and aides tick through the White House operation, it's clear Vice President Mike Pence is very much in the thick of it. The President's legislative team has been in the room every step of the way. Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Seema Verma is constantly on the phone with GOP senators.  But the President? \"He's not the details guy,\" the aide said. \"And senators need details.\"  The Heller ads: You can't overstate how infuriated GOP senators  are about ads a pro-Trump super PAC ran against  fellow Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, criticizing him for opposing the bill. Republicans raised it behind closed doors to Pence Tuesday, and again to Trump. McConnell (and his outside allies) raised it to several people on the President's political orbit. The bruises from this stunt aren't going to heal any time soon.  Profiles in courage: Three GOP senators came out firmly opposed to draft bill  after  McConnell delayed the vote and promised changes . That makes nine total. A few others, most notably Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, broke their general silence to say they had problems with it. What does that mean? Two things:  1. Not unlike the four conservatives who came out immediately after the draft was released, this was in part a negotiating tactic. If you come out publicly against something, you're positioning yourself to try and secure future changes.  2. It is, say, politically advantageous to oppose something with a low double-digit approval rating that you know leadership isn't going to make you vote on (for now) The newly declared \"no\" votes underscore something CNN reporters been hearing for a few days: the opposition was far deeper than was publicly known.  So what's it all mean: The reality is the dynamics haven't changed. McConnell knows quite well what each of his members wants to get to yes. Similarly, he likely knows what they *need* to get to yes. He has money to give moderates in the near term. He can pitch regulatory changes to the conservatives. That wasn't enough this week. Now it's a question of how to get enough of them into a single bill, while not completely alienating the other side of the ideological spectrum, and somehow manage to get to 50 votes.  What they want:  Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio\/Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia\/Susan Collins of Maine:  Opioid funding  Heller\/Capito\/Portman:  Return Medicaid growth rate as pegged to medical inflation More from Heller:  Slower Medicaid expansion phase out; don't allow states to strip out essential health benefits; whatever else Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada says he wants or needs Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas\/Mike Lee of Utah\/Rand Paul of Kentucky\/Ron Johnson of Wisconsin: A llow competing insurance plans completely exempt from Obamacare regulations to be sold\/more HSA flexibility  Collins\/Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\/Jerry Moran of Kansas:  Rural hospital funding  Collins\/Murkowski:  Strip out plans to defund Planned Parenthood  Paul:  Significant changes to: the subsidy structure, regulations, Health Spending Account flexibility, Medicaid expansion phaseout, etc.   A final (really) important point: At the center of the Republican inability to reach a compromise here are significant, intra-party ideological differences on how to approach health care.  The simple fact is a large chunk of the Senate GOP conference likes the central pieces of Obamacare, and whether for political reasons or policy, they don't want them to go. That's an anathema to the other side of the conference and to all the conservative outside groups.  In other words: these aren't minor policy quibbles and stubborn fights over parochial issues. This is about belief systems (or constituent belief systems, reflected by their senator) on what the government's role should be in health care. And a real question of whether that gap can ever be bridged.

Rand Paul to repeal the 2001 and 2002 war authorizations the US military uses to fight terrorism across the globe. The Senate voted 61-36 in a procedural motion to kill Paul's amendment, which would have repealed the two Authorizations for Use of Military Force after six months, giving Congress a window to draft a new, updated war authorization. Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has argued that the 2001 and 2002 war authorizations -- which were passed to authorize military action against Al Qaeda and in Iraq -- are hopelessly out of date as the military focuses on fighting ISIS across the Middle East, a group that didn't exist at that time. While Paul's amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was unsuccessful, he said it was a victory just to get the Senate to debate and take a vote on the war authorizations. \"It's the first time in 15 years to actually debate what our role is in declaring an initiation of war,\" Paul told reporters just before the vote. \"The problem with waiting for the AUMF first, for a new authorization, is we've been waiting 16 years, and it's not coming without somebody giving somebody a kick in the seat in the pants.\" The vote did not break down along party lines. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois were among the Democrats joining Paul in his effort to sunset the current war authorizations.  All of the Democrats generating buzz about a potential 2020 presidential run, including Warren, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, voted with Paul. Thirteen Democrats voted with most Republicans to defeat the measure Just two Republicans other than Paul, Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Dean Heller of Nevada, voted for the amendment. Paul was also opposed by both Republicans and Democrats, including the two leaders of the Senate armed services committee, Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island. \"To rescind the AUMF that authorizes action against these forces -- and to leave nothing but uncertainty for our deployed forces and for our allies -- is simply irresponsible, and it breaks faith with our volunteer force,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. The Trump administration -- and the Obama administration before it -- argued they have sufficient legal authority to carry out US military operations against ISIS and Al Qaeda, and that a new one is not needed, although the Trump administration has indicated it isn't outright opposed to the effort to pass a new one. Wednesday's vote was the second time this year that Congress has taken action targeting the 2001 war authorization, which was passed just days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In June, the House appropriations committee  approved an amendment  from California Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee to sunset the 2001 war authorization. Lee was the only member in the House to vote against the authorization when it passed in 2001. But congressional leaders have been weary of passing a new war authorization, and House Republicans  stripped Lee's amendment  out of the defense appropriations bill when it was passed on the floor. In the Senate, Paul forced a vote on his amendment by threatening to object to all other amendments on the NDAA, the massive defense policy bill the Senate is considering this week. Had Paul done so, it would have effectively killed any other amendment votes. Paul's effort isn't the only one ongoing in the Senate to pass a new war authorization. Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine and Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake have  introduced a war authorization  that the Senate foreign relations committee may consider, which would also sunset the 2001 and 2002 war authorizations with a new five-year authorization for US military operations against ISIS, al Qaeda, the Taliban and \"associated\" forces. But Kaine and Flake split on Paul's amendment.  Kaine said he supported Paul's effort, arguing that it was \"way past time for Congress to take this up and for everybody to be on the record.\" Flake, however, argued that he supported Paul's goal, but not his method of repealing the current war authorization without a new one in place. \"I cannot support my colleague's effort to repeal the 2001 AUMF in 6 months because of the very real risk associated with repealing such a vital law before we have something to replace it with,\" Flake said.  Senate foreign relations chairman Bob Corker said he agreed with Paul that Congress needs to take action on a new war authorization, but said he was opposed to the substance of Paul's effort. \"Doing away with the legal basis under which we're going against ISIS today, before we've implemented and put in place another one, to me is not prudent,\" Corker said.","articles_date":"13 9 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/09\/13\/politics\/senate-isis-war-vote\/index.html","articles_title":"Senate rejects bid to repeal war authorizations","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":245,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) A top official at the Department of Health and Human Services has been placed on administrative leave after a CNN KFile inquiry while the agency investigates social media postings in which he pushed unfounded smears on social media. Jon Cordova serves as the principal deputy assistant secretary for administration at HHS. A KFile review of Cordova's social media accounts found that he pushed stories filled with baseless claims and conspiracy theories, including stories that claimed Gold Star father Khizr Khan is a \"Muslim Brotherhood agent\" and made baseless claims about Sen. Ted Cruz's personal life. \"Mr. Cordova is currently on administrative leave while we look into this issue further,\" a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. Cordova did not respond to a request for comment. Cordova  joined  HHS in February of 2017, initially as part of the Office of the White House Liaison. In his current role, Cordova oversees day-to-day operations for the Office of Human Relations, Office of the Chief Information Officer, Office of Security and Strategic Information, Equal Employment Opportunity Compliance and Operations Office and the Program Support Center, according to his biography posted on the HHS website. Prior to joining HHS, Cordova  served  as a Trump delegate from California to the Republican National Convention and worked in communications for Donald Trump's campaign in California. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Cordova routinely promoted stories on social media that pushed fringe claims about Trump's opponents that have no basis in fact. In July 2016, Cordova  shared a story  that asserted without evidence that Khan, who spoke out against Trump at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, was a \"Muslim Brotherhood agent\" and \"a Muslim plant working with the Hillary Clinton campaign.\" He also shared another story that  falsely claimed  the Clinton Foundation paid Khan. Cordova also shared unfounded and false stories that claimed Cruz, a Texas Republican frequented prostitutes, was involved in a sex scandal and was hiding various public records related to his birth and education. In a post in 2013, Cordova  called  Democrats \"the real racists\" and said that 95% of blacks would not have voted for President Barack Obama if he were white. In a December 2016  comment on Facebook  on an article about a nonprofit selling access to President Trump during the inauguration, Cordova called Clinton \"a slimy trailer trash huckster.\" Cordova also repeatedly shared fake or conspiratorial stories, including one that claimed that Clinton was  photoshopping her rallies  to make them look bigger, one with  a fake quote  from Clinton about Democratic voters,  one that claimed  NBA star Dwyane Wade endorsed Trump and one with a photoshopped picture of a black man holding a sign that read, \"No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store.\" Cordova also struck a conspiratorial tone on his since-scrubbed Twitter account, of which only a few tweets are archived on several websites. In one tweet, Cordova called for a boycott of Budweiser because the company supported \"jihadis\" over white immigration.

(CNN) Democrats in the post-2016 world have potty mouths. Swearing has become such a part of Democratic stump speeches that profane clips have become routine in Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez's speeches. With children on stage behind him, Perez told an audience in Las Vegas this weekend that Trump \"doesn't give a shit about health care.\" Perez, President Barack Obama's former labor secretary, made similar comments earlier this year. \"They call it a skinny budget, I call it a shitty budget,\" Perez said in Portland, Maine. Maybe it's a calculated move to conjure up excitement. Maybe it's a direct response to the President Donald Trump, who repeatedly riled up campaign crowds with expletives incorporated into policy pronouncements. Whatever the motivation, it appears to be a trend -- and it's not just Perez. Political profanity is not entirely unique -- plenty of lawmakers have cursed in public before. But the fact that Democrats have leaned into swearing months after being defeated by Trump -- an often off-the-cuff and at-times profane candidate -- signals that as much as the opposing party maligns the President, they also want to crib some of his unpredictable style. The DNC has also followed the lead of its new chairman.  Earlier this month they began selling a t-shirt  that read, \"Democrats give a shit about people.\" \"Tom is angry, and he's angry because Donald Trump continues to stick it to the American people,\" Xochitl Hinojosa, spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement. \"Whether it's attempting to kick people off their health care or making it harder to buy a home, his policies are hurting our country, and Tom will continue to stand up to Trump and his administration on behalf of the American people.\" Though Democrats obviously see an upside to swearing, there are obvious downsides, too. Perez's swearing in front of kids raised eyebrows over the weekend and caused some to question the reason behind it. There is also the risk of seeming inauthentic: Politicians are not known for their bluntness, so swearing in a scripted speech can, at times, appear forced. It's catching? The chairman's comments in Las Vegas are just the latest in a long line of Democratic swears since Trump was elected to the presidency. \"If we're not helping people, we should go the fuck home,\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, said  in a recent interview with New York Magazine . Gillibrand also told the magazine that she had \"no fucking clue\" how to pass a bill when she started in the Senate and recalled anxiety dreams she was having where she forgets to \"fucking order\" Girl Scout cookies from a friend. And the swearing has made its way onto the campaign trail, too. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a Texas Democrat who plans to challenge Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, has taken to saying \"shit\" on the campaign trial. O'Rourke slammed Cruz earlier this month for campaigning all over the country, something he said signals the Republican is \"sure as shit not serving\" his constituents. He has also used the swearing in interviews, describing Obamacare in an interview with Politico bluntly: \"That shit doesn't work.\" Trump effect The swearing follows a campaign where Trump, known for his blunt talk and his love of bashing political correctness, made swearing a part of his stump speech. Trump regularly said he would \"bomb the shit out of ISIS,\" and labeled an instance of his opponents' cooperating as \"political bullshit.\" Bashing the way the United States spent money in Iraq, Trump said in 2011: \"In the meantime, we can't get a fucking school built in Brooklyn.\" Trump, in the same speech, also bashed elected officials for not ordering the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stop raising oil prices. \"We have nobody in Washington that sits back and says 'you are not going to raise the fucking price,' \" Trump told supporters in Las Vegas. Of course, none of these politicians are the first to swear in public, but doing it routinely, on-purpose in front of crowds is a departure. Sen. John. Kerry of Massachusetts, during his 2004 presidential campaign, said in a magazine interview he didn't expect President George W. Bush to \"fuck (the country) up\" as much as he did. And Bush, during his 2000 presidential campaign, was caught on an open mic calling a reporter a \"major-league asshole.\" CNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report","articles_date":"24 4 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/24\/politics\/tom-perez-swearing-trump\/index.html","articles_title":"Sh*t talking is Democrats' new strategy","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":247,"issue":6,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Several Republican candidates endorsed by Steve Bannon began distancing themselves from the former White House chief strategist Wednesday after President Donald Trump said Bannon had \"lost his mind.\"  Two Bannon-backed Senate hopefuls downplayed the importance of his support and underscored their commitment to Trump's agenda. In Arizona, a spokesman for Kelli Ward -- the conservative that hard-liner Bannon backed even as leading GOP strategists and Trump himself attempted to recruit someone else into the race to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake -- cast Bannon's endorsement as unimportant.  \"Steve Bannon is only one of many high-profile endorsements Dr. Ward has received. Her focus remains on winning this race, which she is in a great position to do, and then helping President Trump advance an America First agenda,\" Ward press secretary Zachery Henry said.  Trump hammered Bannon in a remarkable four-paragraph statement after adapted excerpts of a forthcoming book in which Bannon described a Trump Tower meeting between Trump's son and a group of Russians as \"treasonous\" and \"unpatriotic\" were released. The Wall Street Journal later reported that in another section of the book, Bannon is quoted describing Ivanka Trump as  \"dumb as a brick.\"   A spokeswoman for West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the Bannon-backed candidate who faces Rep. Evan Jenkins in the primary before a match-up with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, criticized Bannon's remarks about Trump's family.  \"Patrick Morrisey has been endorsed by many conservatives throughout West Virginia and America because of his strong conservative record. Attorney General Morrisey does not support these attacks on President Trump and his family, and was proud to stand with President Trump in 2016 when they were both overwhelmingly elected in West Virginia and when he cast his vote for Trump in the Electoral College,\" Morrisey spokeswoman Nachama Soloveichik said.  Her comment came an hour after Jenkins said in a statement that Morrisey \"should immediately disavow Bannon's support.\"  Michael Grimm, a House candidate from New York who months ago heaped praise on Bannon, also sharply criticized the Breitbart executive.  \"I strongly denounce the comments by Steve Bannon as quoted by Michael Wolff. They are baseless attacks against the President's family, beyond disturbing, and I fully support our Commander in Chief,\" Grimm said in a statement. Others offered at least tepid support for Bannon. In Nevada, Sen. Dean Heller's campaign seized on the Trump-Bannon feud to attack his primary opponent, the Bannon-backed Danny Tarkanian.  \"Danny Tarkanian and Steve Bannon are frauds whose only skill is losing elections and costing Republicans seats,\" said Heller spokesman Keith Schipper.  Tarkanian, meanwhile, was the only candidate to say directly Wednesday that he still wants Bannon's support. \"If Mr. Bannon chooses to support me in our effort to repeal and replace Dean Heller with someone who will truly have the President's back, I welcome his support,\" he said. In Mississippi, state Sen. Chris McDaniel is considering launching a primary challenge against Sen. Roger Wicker -- with Bannon's encouragement. McDaniel also didn't distance himself from Bannon on Wednesday.  \"The establishment's swamp monsters in Washington would like nothing more than to refill the swamp. Conservatives need to work together, not tear each other apart,\" he said in a text message when asked about the Trump-Bannon feud. \"If we are divided, they win. We can't let them win.\"  In other Senate races, Bannon has endorsed Attorney General Josh Hawley in Missouri, state auditor Matt Rosendale in Montana, Rep. Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee and businessman Kevin Nicholson in Wisconsin.

He is the author of \" The Essential Bernie Sanders and His Vision for America ,\" president of the Economic Future Group and the host of the Working Life podcast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.  (CNN) There is only one silver lining in yesterday's election results, which will allow a con man, a pathological liar, a bold racist and a sexual predator to succeed the first African-American president.  We can now launch a difficult but urgent mission \u2014 shaking the Democratic Party down to its foundation, ejecting the failed Bill\/Hillary Clinton economic and global worldview and standing up for a set of populist, sound economic and foreign policy principles that could earn majority support. On the surface, it's astounding that a man who  ripped off  thousands of people who worked for him became the champion of the regular Joe. But, as  Bernie Sanders  reiterated in a recent podcast with me, the problem is that people have ceased to see a difference between the parties, particularly on economic issues. I'll briefly cite a few examples. Starting out with NAFTA, Bill Clinton forced \" free trade \" upon the party. I warned multiple times during the election that Trump would make inroads with voters in the Rust Belt unless Democrats  made a clean break  from corporate trade deals. Around the globe, these deals are a key tool to drive down wages, exploit workers and prosecute global class warfare. But, the current president still serves up the malarkey about the benefits of these deals. Bill Clinton's broader economic agenda was even more corrosive. During Clinton's so-called \"good economy,\" the decline of organized labor continued. The president, and his secretary of labor, Robert Reich, did very little to arrest the decline.  No Democratic president was more focused on letting business interests off the leash. He gave more power to media companies, triggering consolidation and a powerful wave of concentration of the media into a few hands. The average person, not steeped in policy, understood this every time he or she opened their skyrocketing cable bills.  Hand-in-glove with Wall Street, Clinton got rid of the Glass Steagall Act, which removed the separation between commercial banks, insurers and investment banks, allowing the self-dealing manipulation of mortgages and interest  rates and accelerating the shifting of huge wealth into the hands of a few.  Again, the average person, just trying to make ends meet, eventually got the sharpest end of that spear when millions of people lost their homes, jobs and retirement in the thundering collapse known as the Great Recession, which, for many, has been a depression. There is so much more: A planet dying because for years fossil fuel interests were coddled. Welfare reform. Mass incarceration of people of color, which had both racial and economic consequences. The praise of the Clinton years, and red-faced defense by its leader, was always couched in contrast to the Reagan and two Bush Administrations. Great. Feeding off the Clinton machine, the Democratic Party has become riddled with lobbyists, billionaires, and hustlers who pocket huge sums of money by running either nonprofit \"think tanks\" or election-cycle networks, and politicians who, indeed, are focused mostly on reelection. Surrounding the party are extremely well-paid non-profit leaders, who end up defending the status quo. Chief component of the Clinton machine in recent years, the Clinton Foundation operated somewhat out of sight.  The big donations streaming from anti-union powerhouses like Wal-Mart or big financial entities like Bank of America not only whitewashed the policies of interests directly opposed to what the Democratic Party should stand for, but they also clouded the deeper systemic crisis within the party. We can only address climate change, poverty and global inequality by axing the very system benefiting many of the donors to the Clinton Foundation. Fast forward to the 2016 election. There is  no doubt in my mind  that Bernie Sanders would have defeated Trump. His authenticity would have pierced through Trump's fraudulent appeal. His concise, point-by-point evisceration of a failed economic model and aggressive, blundering foreign policy was entirely understandable to voters. As one of Sen. Sanders' national surrogates, I went to dozens of his rallies. At each one, he took to the stage, a big sheaf of papers in his hands, and, treating people as adults not just backdrops for TV ads, he conducted a seminar on America and the globe. People are quite familiar with Sanders' economic agenda, including higher taxes on the wealthy, expanding Social Security and a single-payer Medicare for All system. All of which were sound economically, not to mention morally urgent. What was often given short shrift was his broader philosophical willingness to challenge American exceptionalism. Many times, including during two national debates, he pointed out that, while he was proud as a son of immigrants to be an American, this country has supported repressive dictators, sent the CIA on missions to help overthrow democratically elected governments that were not supportive enough of our interests and sent our young men and women to die in immoral wars. And he wasn't afraid to point out that those failed foreign policies have been bedrocks of the Democratic Party for several decades.  Rather than foster a good debate during the primaries, the party, obsessed with the coronation of an anointed candidate, set out to destroy Sanders and his movement.  The various email leaks showing broad collusion only confirmed what was patently obvious on the surface: We stood in opposition to a virtual wall of elected Democratic officials, and party functionaries. Proudly so, I might add.  As a union member, I was particularly saddened to see the labor movement mostly line up in the primaries behind the status quo \u2014 a status quo often linked arm-and-arm with corporate interests bent on destroying unions. Beyond rhetoric, democracy was not valued. Once Sanders effectively conceded the race, he took on full-throated advocacy for Secretary Clinton. To support his position, many of us, including me, agreed to play nice at the convention and beyond, because we felt that Donald Trump was a unique threat to the nation. On the night Tim Kaine spoke to the convention, many Sanders delegates like me wanted to express respectful opposition to President Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement by holding signs. But, our signs were confiscated, and, when we made some homemade versions on the back of the officially-sanctioned Kaine signs, we were told to cease and desist or our credentials would be revoked. So much for democracy. More important, that gagging of pretty mild protest was symbolic. The party is not an open place, beyond rhetoric, to a whole swath of activists and voters who want deep, systemic change. So, now what? Yesterday was indeed devastating. My niece texted me, \"what do we do now?\" Her desperate question broke my heart. I grew up in a feminist household: My mother was one of a handful of women to break a glass ceiling, going to medical school after she already had her three kids.  I know many young women are mourning the blow of a President Trump partly because of the rejection of a woman as the first president -- which is yet another reason I argue we must remake the Democratic Party.  First, the Clinton machine must be rooted out of the party. A quarter of a century is enough time to understand that its ideology has failed the American people.  Second, the Democratic National Committee has to be turned inside out. The disgraced and deposed chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, is only the worst symptom of this wider truth. The party has lost hundreds of state legislative seats, Republicans now control two-thirds of state chambers and have a comfortable majority of governorships (who will determine redistricting in 2020). They have a historic margin in the House of Representatives, will continue to run the Senate and, thus, likely put a Trump-stamp on the Supreme Court.  Third, we need to run targeted primary contests broadly and across the board to replace elected officials who don't want to see a more open, vibrant and inclusive party. The Sanders movement has shown we can raise the money to fund challengers \u2014 and they are ready, by the thousands, to compete. With these changes, and drawing from the energy of many great activists, a new Democratic Party can be revitalized. The progressive movement, in all its elements \u2014 advocates for labor, environmentalists, and civil rights of all stripes \u2014 can shape that future.","articles_date":"11 11 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/11\/09\/opinions\/democratic-party-burn-tasini\/index.html","articles_title":"Tear up the Democratic Party","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":250,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Up for a second Senate term in Texas this year, \"Lyin' Ted\" Cruz, as President Donald Trump nicknamed him, is suddenly Trump's biggest fan.  Faced with a  potentially tough re-election battle against Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke , Cruz has used recent public appearances -- including a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday -- to embrace Trump, stake out hard-line positions in debates over gun control and immigration, and antagonize Democrats.  On Thursday, he even invoked \"The Simpsons.\"  \"The Democrats are the party of Lisa Simpson,\" Cruz said of the know-it-all character. \"And Republicans are happily the party of Homer, Bart, Maggie and Marge.\"  Cruz's moves underscore his view of the upcoming midterm elections as a duel of the party's bases -- and whichever turns out more of its voters wins.  That means turning out Trump's supporters.  The senator Trump had once called \"Lyin' Ted\" on Thursday heaped praise on the President's first year in office. \"On substance, the record of delivering has been remarkable,\" he said.  He also embraced Trump's opposition to stricter gun laws, accusing Democrats of politicizing the issue after the mass shooting last week at a high school in Parkland, Florida -- as well as the President's call to arm teachers.   \"Every time you see a horrific crime, people in the media and Democratic politicians immediately try to leap on it to advance their agenda, and their agenda is stripping Second Amendment rights from law-abiding citizens,\" Cruz said, adding that confiscating guns is \"where they want to end up.\"  \"I think it makes perfect sense that if teachers want to exercise their right to keep and bear arms, it will only make schools safer,\" he said.  It all sounds like something of a 180-degree turn for Cruz, who used his speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention to urge Americans to vote their consciences -- effectively extending permission to break with the party's presidential nominee. Cruz has had Trump's back outside the Washington area as well.  In Dallas last weekend, Cruz aligned himself with Trump on special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, saying investigators had found no evidence of collusion, an inaccurate claim with the investigation still underway.  \"On the face of these indictments, they say that the American side of it was unwitting -- that there was not collusion. That's pretty significant,\" he told reporters.  Cruz has also staked out ground to the right of Trump on some issues. He pleased immigration hard-liners this month by casting the Senate's lone vote against opening a debate on three competing bills that would give \"Dreamers\" a path to legal status, all of which were voted down.  Cruz's moves could even come at the risk of his future presidential prospects: He angered Iowa Republicans by blocking Iowa Agriculture Secretary Bill Northey for a federal agriculture post, citing ethanol regulations that he says harm oil refineries.  The Iowa Republican Party's central committee approved a resolution urging Cruz to withdraw his hold on Northey's nomination. State GOP chairman Jeff Kaufmann sent Cruz a letter warning that should he \"wish to remain in good standing with Iowa Republicans,\" he must release his hold on Northey and \"end the political points he is attempting to gain in an election year.\"","articles_date":"22 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/22\/politics\/ted-cruz-cpac-trump\/index.html","articles_title":"Ted Cruz embraces Trump ahead of re-election","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":251,"issue":8,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Alyssa Milano did not show Ted Cruz much Twitter love on Thursday.

So, am I making any mistakes in my analysis, Senator?  Well, Bill, you know, I think people across New York and across the country know exactly what New York values means and those are the values of Liberal Democratic politicians who have been hammering this state. You know, I have been campaigning across New York and people are stopping me literally every day and say, I know exactly what you meant, and I'm fed up with what these Liberal Democrats are doing to us, the people of New York. They are the ones suffering for it. And as you noted, Donald Trump has been funding it year after year after year. : But not as a politician. You know, you and I because, you know, because I gave Trump some advice when he comes on here although I guess he is mad at me now. I'm not sure. But I will give you a little advice. Do you know what you should do? Hold a press conference in Penn Station. Hold a press conference in Penn Station. Take a look at what's happened to that place under the uber-liberal Mayor Bill de Blasio. But -- : Uh-hm. : The perception of New Yorkers and almost 10,000 people showed up to hear Trump speak at Bethpage on Long Island.  Yes. : Perception is, you are a Texas guy, you are a Bible belt guy, you don't understand us up here. You know, that's what is going around. Let me tell you. Yesterday I was in the Bronx and I had a meeting with Hispanic and African-American pastors who were -- it was a tremendous gathering and it was interesting. It was hosted by a democratic state senator named Reuben Diaz. He is an elected Democrat representing the Bronx and the New York State Senate. And he brought up New York values. He said you know what? I know exactly what you meant by that and he brought up that Andrew Cuomo, the governor said if you are pro-life, if you support traditional marriage, if you believe in the Second Amendment, there is no place for you in New York state. And Senator Diaz, a Democrat, he said I'm a democrat but my Democratic governor said there is no place for me as a pastor. That's the sort of liberal intolerance. : Right. But Trump doesn't subscribe to any of that.  Of course he does, he funded it. : You can have two lives. : But no, Bill, Bill -- : Yes.  He wrote two checks to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. He didn't have to do that to build -- to do any real estate. He did that --  Why do you think that you know how to play the game here? Look, I want to tell you this --  No, that's not true. I know lots of businessmen who have never given a check to Hillary Clinton.  You are more conservative than Trump. : Bill, it's actually -- Bill, it's actually not a question of being more conservative or not. If you are fed up with the corruption of Washington -- : Yes.  Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are flip sides of the same coin. Hillary Clinton has made millions of dollars selling power and access in Washington and Donald Trump has made billions of dollars buying power and access in Washington, buying people like Hillary Clinton.  But he did it as a businessman. He did it as a businessman. : But he is part of the corruption. He is part of the corruption.  All right. : He has funded open border Democrats for 40 years. And the people of New York are hurting. You know, you want to see what New York values look like? Look at Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Liberal Democrat. That politician right after he got elected one of the first things he did is he tried to shut down charter schools in Harlem. Tried to throw young African-American and Hispanic kids out of schools that were giving them hope because is he so much in hock to the union bosses and teachers. : But you are running against Trump. You're running against Trump. And that's what I want to get back to.  But Trump is responsible for the policies he supported.  I'm not buying that. You and Kasich have got to. : I know. You defend him a lot, Bill. That's your prerogative.  I defend him when -- I defend him on points that I think are valid, but I go after him and that's why he is not on the program because he is mad at me. All right? But -- : He is terrified to debate. As you know I invited him to debate on your show and --  He doesn't want to do that.  And he is terrified to debate. : I don't know if he is terrified. : Because he doesn't have any real solutions. He doesn't have any real answers. : All right. You and Kasich have got to keep him under 50 percent. Okay? If you do, then you both pick up some delegates, if you don't, if you don't do, he gets the whole deal. So, he is going to go, he is going to go wild, he's going to do what he's doing, lying Ted. I don't know what he calls Kasich this week but he'll figure out a name. And I'm just wondering what your positive message is to New Yorkers, I mean, what are you selling us? What are you selling us?  So, we just did a rally that had thousands of people standing in line and my positive message, the exact same thing I focused on every day in Wisconsin. And we won a landslide in Wisconsin. : Okay. What is that? : It is three things. It is jobs, freedom and security. My number one priority as president is bringing jobs back to America. : All right. Now, in New York -- : If I'm elected president, we will repeal ObamaCare.  We know all of that. But in New York, specifically, you got a governor who is not going to frack, okay, if you fracked, you would help Upstate New York like crazy. You as president -- Yes. But you're not going to force Cuomo to frack. You see, I don't know how you are going to bring jobs to New York specifically. I have got 30 seconds. : Let me answer you, Bill. You bring jobs to New York by repealing Obamacare, by passing a flat tax, by abolishing the IRS. By reigning in the ETA and federal regulators. By stopping amnesty and ending sanctuary cities and we will see millions of high paying jobs. We will see wages rising and we'll see young people coming out of school with opportunity and with three, four, five job offers again. That's what this election is about. Jobs and raising wages for working Americans who corrupt Washington has been leading behind. All right. So if you do the press conference in Penn Station, I will go, I want to see that. Is that place is unbelievable. It's like New Delhi, India. That's what it looks like now. All right.

And he is popular. : And there is not a lot of difference between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on policy. So, they are both socialists. Just one admits it. Well, Hillary doesn't practice socialism where Bernie kind of does. All right. So, you think it's the rough and tumble that have gotten through to the folks and they are tired of it but, if you run against Hillary Clinton. It's going to be rough and tumble. Really that's going to be a tough --  No doubt. But my response in the primary as insults and nasty personal attacks have flown. I haven't played that game. I haven't responded in kind. When people have insulted me, I don't insult them back. : No, I mean, trump has called you lying Ted and you haven't really come back like Marco Rubio did. But it did not work for Rubio interestingly enough. It did not work.  My focus both in the primary and on the general is on substance. So, if Hillary engages on nasty attacks. I intend to go to the economy, to jobs and the people hurting that the Obama-Clinton economy doesn't work. : It won't be her but her surrogates that come after you. : Oh, sure. : Now, the \"New York Times,\" front-page article on you today saying that you are the most conservative political candidate since Barry Goldwater. Is that fair?  Well, you know, it's funny. I think the times meant it to be a hit piece. I actually retweeted it and sent it around to people. : You think that's okay. : Well, we're so tired of being lied to. You didn't hear my Talking Points memo because you just got here. The senators would enough to come in. That's exactly what I said.  Yes.  We're just being lied to all the time. But the times' point was on abortion and some other issues you are so far out of the mainstream according to the polls that it might be hard for you to get the populous support and put you in the White House.  Well, I think it's fair to say, the times is not exactly a barometer for the mainstream. : No, but they're going on the polling -- : I have no idea what the mainstream is. What I will say that the \"Times\" says right is that I'm a consistent conservative. But I've been a conservative my whole life. Now, the values I'm fighting for are common sense values. I think this election comes down to three issues, jobs, freedom, and security. And not a one of those is the narrow 51 percent wedge issue. Those are all unifying, 50, 70, 80 percent issue that bring us together. : Within the tent of those issues, you're going to have to deal with specifics. For example, they say, the \"Times\" says that you're against abortion even in cases of rape and incest. Is that true?  It is true that I'm pro-life but, you know, Bill -- : No, no, no. Rape and incest?  Yes. It is true that I'm pro-life. But let me just give the flip side of that. Hillary Clinton's position on abortion. : Anything goes.  Anything goes up to the moment of delivery. Partial birth.  Let's stay on you. But I want to underscore something for a second --  Right. : Because the Times says, she is mainstream, do you know nine percent of Americans agree with Hillary Clinton on abortion? Ninety one percent disagree with radical and extreme. : You are correct when you said \"The New York Times\" is not a mainstream publication. : Exactly. : However, you will going to have some trouble will all due respect on the rape and incest abortion thing with women voters. And all the polls say it. Now, is there a strategy or are you just going to say, I'm staying with this.  You know, listen, I recognize that the media loves to focus on issues where they think they can hit Republicans over and over again. I'm talking about jobs. That is what I talked about. Every day over and over again. That's my focus. : Right.  People want jobs and wages coming up. We want jobs coming back from Mexico. Back from China. We want manufacturing jobs back in America. And I'm the only candidate with a positive, concrete, serious plan to bring those jobs back. : Okay. It's tax day. IRS. : Yes.  You want to ban the IRS. Disband the whole operation.  Yes. I'm a simple man. Who is going to collect the taxes? So, well, I'm running on a simple flat tax where everyone of us will pay 10 percent flat tax. Fill out our taxes on a postcard.  Okay. But who going to collect the 10 percent?  You go to our website TedCruz.org and see the postcard. All right.  When we abolish the mass that is the IRS code. : Yes.  There are more words in the IRS code than there are on war and peace than there are in the Bible. The entity that exists is the IRS becomes largely unnecessary. : But who is going to collect the money? : A small office in the Treasury Department. But my point is, this IRS is so corrupt, it's politicized, it's -- : So, you are going to establish the Treasury Department as the collector, right?  Sure.  It's ziggy in Ohio says blank you, I'm not paying, does he go to jail?  Of course he does. : Okay. So you have to have enforcement done out of the Treasury Department on taxes?  On a postcard. Yes. Somebody has got to collect the postcard and someone has to enforce that if you don't pay your taxes, the federal government comes after you. That's how taxes work.  Okay. We have a lot more questions and not a lot of time. But it's likely that you are not going to do that well in New York. Okay? : Thanks for the vote of confidence.  My job is to tell the truth.  I'm kidding. I'm kidding. : It's not about you so much. It's about the state and what the state responds to. Is that going to reenergize the Trump campaign? And do you have anything that you are going to say on Wednesday to blunt it. : Listen. New York is Donald's home state. : It is. : Of course he is going to do well in his home state. When we were in Texas my home state, we walloped him in Texas. : Right.  Let me say one thing on taxes. : Real quick. : Just because it is tax day. : Right. : I've released nine years of tax returns. : And you want Trump to release -- : Donald needs to release his tax returns. He's claims he has been audited for a couple of years. So, release the other years. : All right. Senator, thanks for coming in. We appreciate it.","articles_date":"19 04 2016","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/transcript\/2016\/04\/19\/ted-cruz-on-winning-over-voters.html","articles_title":"Ted Cruz on winning over voters","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":254,"issue":8,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Texas Sen. Ted Cruz warned Tuesday that his state could turn blue if conservatives don't turn out to vote. Cruz, speaking to radio host Hugh Hewitt, was discussing the early vote totals ahead of Texas' March 6 primary, which showed Democrats held a 45,000-vote lead in the early vote in the state's 15 largest counties. During the last two midterm cycles, 2014 and 2010, Democrats trailed Republicans by more than 120,000 early primary votes in those counties. The Democrats' early vote lead is a sign of enthusiasm among their base heading into the midterm elections, where Democrats are hoping to capitalize on President Donald Trump's unpopularity with their base to win majorities in the House and Senate.  \"The Democrats are showing up in big, big numbers. We need to make sure we get conservatives showing up to keep Texas bright red,\" Cruz told Hewitt. \"Look, I think this is a volatile election. I think it could go a lot of directions.\" Cruz continued, \"The extreme left, they're angry. They're filled with rage. They hate the President. And mark my words, we are going to see historic turnout from the extreme left in November, which means if conservatives stay home, we have the potential, we could lose both houses of Congress.\" Cruz's sentiment was echoed by John Cornyn, the senior Republican senator from Texas, who told CNN's Phil Mattingly, with a chuckle: \"Well, it got my attention.\" \"I guess we need to encourage the President to send out emails for the general election to all 800,000 people he has on his database and encourage them to vote in November,\" Cornyn added. \"I think it would be malpractice if we didn't pay attention and respond accordingly.\" Cruz, unlike Cornyn, is up for re-election in 2018, and is fending off a challenge from Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a US representative from El Paso who has been touring every county in the state. O'Rourke outraised Cruz from the beginning of 2018 through mid-February by $1.5 million, although Cruz is still favored to win in the state.

Former El Paso County Judge Veronica Escobar is projected to easily take the Democratic nomination in the race to represent the state's 16th Congressional District, winning more than 60% of the vote. Both candidates won in safe Democratic districts, meaning they are likely to win their general election matchups in November.  \"I'm so honored to be your Democratic nominee, El Paso!\" Escobar wrote on  Facebook  Tuesday night. \"We're going to make history by electing the first Tejana to Congress in November, and I couldn't have done it without all of you!\" In Texas' 29th Congressional District, state Sen.

Barnes is a member of the CNN Decision Desk and co-author of the 2018 Almanac of American Politics.    (CNN) Democrat Ralph Northam's convincing 54%-45% victory over Republican Ed Gillespie in the Virginia governor's race underscores the challenge that many GOP candidates may face in urban and suburban communities in the midterm elections next year, especially if President Donald Trump's popularity continues to sag. According to a CNN exit poll of Virginia voters after they cast their ballots, nearly 3 out of 5 disapproved of the job that Trump is doing. That is almost identical to President Barack Obama's negative standing among Virginia voters in 2014, when Gillespie, then the Republican nominee for Senate, came within 22,000 votes, less than a percentage point, of upsetting the popular Democratic incumbent, Mark Warner. With nearly all the precincts reporting, Gillespie lost to Northam by more than 232,000 votes. Nowhere was the metropolitan advantage greater for Northam than in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington DC. Overall, the Democrat won nearly 68% of the vote, eclipsing the 64% mark set by Hillary Clinton in last year's presidential race and easily exceeding the 57% that Warner captured in 2014 and the 58% that Democrat Terry McAuliffe scored when he won the 2013 gubernatorial contest. Moreover, turnout rose in Northern Virginia in relation to the rest of the state: the region, which includes Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William Counties, and the Democratic bastion of Alexandria, accounted for roughly 30% of the statewide vote, up from 28% in the 2013 governor's race. Gillespie's 31% showing in Fairfax, the largest vote-producing county in the state, is not only less than his 40% tally in 2014, it's less than the 36% that Republican Ken Cuccinelli, a conservative hard-liner, garnered in the 2013 gubernatorial contest. In Loudoun and Prince William, Northam bested Gillespie, 60%-40% and 61%-38%, respectively. In his 2014 Senate race, Gillespie narrowly won Loudoun with 49% of the vote and was bested by Warner in Prince William by only 50-48%. Even in the distant exurbs of Stafford County, which Virginia Republicans have won by commanding margins in recent years, Gillespie only edged Northam by 52%-47%.  But the blue tide in the suburbs and exurbs extended well beyond the Capital Beltway. In the Hampton Roads area, which includes Norfolk and Virginia Beach, Northam defeated Gillespie 60%-38%, again besting the margins scored by Clinton, Warner and McAuliffe. Northam became the first top statewide Democratic candidate to carry both of the suburban battlegrounds of Chesapeake and Virginia Beach in a non-presidential year (when Democratic turnout traditionally ebbs) since Democrat Tim Kaine captured the governorship in 2005. Even in metro areas in rural parts of the state, Northam performed exceeding well. In the city of Harrisonburg, in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley and in the middle of ruby red Rockingham County, Northam won 64%-35%. And while Harrisonburg is Democratic turf, it saw the largest Democratic gain on a percentage point basis (11.2) of any city or county in Virginia over the party's performance in the 2013 governor's race. And in Chesterfield County, the Republican suburbs of Richmond that GOP candidates usually carry with ease, Gillespie barely won by less than 300 votes.  Gillespie did perform well in rural counties in western and central Virginia, but even here there was a downside. In the 15 counties where Democratic percentages fell the most from the 2013 governor's race, all in the mountain west region of the state, only one, Lee County in the extreme southwest corner of the state, saw its total vote tally noticeably rise from 2013. In all the rest, the total vote was flat or fell slightly. This was one election where rural voters could not save a Republican who was hemorrhaging votes all across the metropolitan landscape.","articles_date":"8 11 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/11\/08\/politics\/virginia-suburbs-democrats-virginia-ralph-northam\/index.html","articles_title":"The 'burbs deliver for Democrats in Virginia","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":257,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) UPDATE: This list, first published January 3, was updated with the news that former sheriff Joe Arpaio is entering Arizona's Senate race and state treasurer Josh Mandel is dropping out of Ohio's.  Republicans rid themselves of Roy Moore after his loss in Alabama's special election. Now, though, another widely known and controversial candidate is running under the party's banner: Joe Arpaio. It's a complication in a state that would already have been difficult for Republicans to hold. Right now, Democrats -- or independents who caucus with them -- are defending 25 seats this year, while Republicans are defending just eight. The GOP has a 51-49 advantage at the moment. Here's a look at the 10 Senate seats most likely to switch party hands in this year's midterms, as of January 2018: 1. Arizona Open seat (Republican Sen. Jeff Flake is retiring) The good news for Republicans: Rep. Martha McSally is set to enter the GOP primary this week.  The bad news: Arpaio is in, too.  Headed into a three-way primary that also features conservative state senator Kelli Ward -- who drew 40% of the vote against Sen. John McCain in 2016 -- the most optimistic Republicans hope that Arpaio and Ward will split the anti-establishment vote, opening the door for McSally's nomination.  But we've seen that movie before. In Alabama, two outsiders, Roy Moore and Rep. Mo Brooks, took on establishment preference Sen. Luther Strange in a Senate special election. Moore -- the Arpaio in this comparison -- won the nomination and then lost the seat.  Arpaio, 85, almost certainly won't be a senator. He lost his job as sheriff of Maricopa County (where 60% of Arizona residents live) in 2016 by 13 percentage points even as Trump won the county by 3 points. And that's  before  his conviction and pardon.  But Arpaio's mere presence on the ballot -- and the fact that the primary isn't until late August, which means he'll stay in the race for much of its duration -- will be a fundraising boon to local and national Democrats, and will be a powerful tool to turn out Latino voters.  If McSally prevails, as a former fighter pilot and strong fundraiser running in a red-leaning state, she'd have a real chance.  But Arizona is moving to the left -- the Sun Belt is turning blue as rapidly as Midwestern states like Ohio and Iowa are becoming red -- and Democrats landed their top target in Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. That makes Arizona a prime pickup opportunity.  2. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller There's no easy way out of the box Heller is in.  Danny Tarkanian, who's lost all five of his races in Nevada -- but won four of his five primaries -- is challenging Heller from the right, charging that he's insufficiently supportive of Trump.  Rep. Jacky Rosen, meanwhile, lies ahead in the general election, ready to seize on a favorable environment for Democrats in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and where Heller barely won -- and did it with less than 50% of the vote -- in 2012.  Heller's gymnastics on health care  helped earn Nevada the top spot in our initial rankings. It only drops because of an even messier and more damaging Republican primary in Arizona. 3. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill This is the state where the Steve Bannon vs. Mitch McConnell civil war is on hold and things are largely going according to plan for Republicans.  McCaskill is one of five Democratic senators up for re-election in a state Trump won by double digits in 2016. Unlike the special election in Alabama and contests in several other states -- including Nevada and Arizona -- Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, and McConnell, the Senate majority leader, are both backing Attorney General Josh Hawley here. McConnell pointed to Hawley at a news conference a month ago as the type of candidate he believes \"can actually win.\"  This race will be expensive and brutal. Expect Democrats to cast Hawley, who just won his job a year ago, as a ladder-climber.  4. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Republicans point to two main reasons they can pick off this seat:  1. Donnelly is an accidental senator of sorts, winning only after tea partier Richard Mourdock ousted Sen. Richard Lugar in the primary before collapsing in the general election in 2012.  2. Republican Todd Young shellacked Evan Bayh by 12 points here just a year ago -- and Trump won Indiana even more handily.  But there are a few important differences. Most importantly: None of the three Republicans running this cycle -- Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita and state Rep. Mike Braun -- is as talented, or baggage-free, as Young. (In particular,  Messer faces residency questions , and  people who work for Rokita have accused him of creating a toxic environment .)  Donnelly has kept a low profile and isn't particularly well-defined, but the \"Mexico Joe\" label that followed  an Associated Press report that he profited from a family business's move to outsource jobs to Mexico  still stings.   5. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Manchin's early flirtations with Trump -- which included conversations about a Cabinet post -- may help insulate him in a state the President carried with 69% of the vote in 2016.  But Trump is showing signs he's willing to wield his popularity against the popular former governor, casting him as unserious about bipartisan cooperation. \"He talks. But he doesn't do anything. He doesn't do,\" Trump  told The New York Times  recently.  6. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Trump met last week with Rep. Kevin Cramer, who it's safe to assume is now very likely to run against Heitkamp in this heavily Republican state. Getting him into the race would solve the GOP's biggest problem here -- figuring out who their candidate will be. Former state Sen. Tom Campbell is also running.  In a neutral political environment, the math suggests this seat would be an easy pickup for the GOP: Trump won North Dakota by an eye-popping 36 points in 2016, and Heitkamp won her seat by less than 1 point in 2012.  But this year's crop of Democratic incumbents features several candidates -- Heitkamp, Manchin and Montana's Jon Tester stand out -- with strong individual brands at home that have allowed them to defy their state's partisan makeup. And the nearly $4 million Heitkamp has in the bank goes a long way in North Dakota.  7. Florida Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson Wake me up when Republican Gov. Rick Scott makes up his mind.  If Scott's in, his proven ability to win close races in Florida and self-fund in an extraordinarily expensive state would send Florida up this list in a hurry.  Not only that, he could force Democrats to spend heavily on their effort to retain Nelson's seat -- which could limit the party's ability to go after long shots like Tennessee.  Scott lunched with Trump on New Year's Eve. But on Tuesday he punted when reporters in Jacksonville asked him about a Senate run, noting he has 390 days left in Tallahassee.  8. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Republicans missed on their top recruiting targets here. And now, state auditor Matt Rosendale and businessman Troy Downing are headed toward what could be an expensive and nasty primary.  That's all good news for Tester, whose populist, down-to-earth brand -- bolstered by the fact that he still runs a farm -- allowed him to win in 2006 and 2012 despite Montana's history of voting for Republican presidential nominees (Trump won by 21 points here).  9. Minnesota  Incumbent : Democratic Sen. Tina Smith Minnesota is ground zero in the 2018 midterms: The governor's office, as many as five House seats and not one but two Senate seats are up for grabs: Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar's and this one, vacated by Al Franken.  Smith, Minnesota's lieutenant governor, was appointed by Gov. Mark Dayton to replace Franken.  The Republican field is still taking shape. But an open seat in a state that's moving to the right over time looks, for now, like a slightly more appealing target for Republicans than neighboring Wisconsin, which just missed this list.  10. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown This race dropped from seventh to No. 10 after Republican state treasurer Josh Mandel -- the likely GOP nominee -- unexpectedly dropped out of the race this week.  Republicans are now scrambling to replace him. McConnell has spoken with J.D. Vance, the author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" about running. Rep. Jim Renacci, who is currently running for governor, is another possibility.  But until the GOP field is settled -- and with an early February filing deadline, that'll need to happen quickly -- this race drops.  The reason it's still on the list at all: Trump won here by 9 points in 2016, and Republicans are desperate to lock Ohio into their column permanently. Plus, Brown is seen as a potential 2020 presidential candidate, which means the GOP sees the need to bruise him in this race no matter its outcome.  Elsewhere on the map:  In  Wisconsin , Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin will wait and see who emerges from a packed Republican primary. One to watch: state Sen. Leah Vukmir, a talk radio darling in a state where conservative talk radio really matters.  Democrats got their dream recruit in former Gov. Phil Bredesen in  Tennessee , where they hope to pick off retiring Sen. Bob Corker's seat. But is Bredesen still the force he was 15 years ago, or is he this cycle's Evan Bayh? We'll wait and see before moving this race up the list. New Jersey  Democratic Sen. Bob Mendendez's corruption trial ended in a mistrial, but the fact that he faced the charges at all makes his fate worth watching. Republicans would love to put Democratic Sen. Bob Casey's seat in  Pennsylvania  in play, and they have a Trump ally in Rep. Lou Barletta to try it. Democrats, meanwhile, hope Rep. Beto O'Rourke can catch fire in  Texas  against Sen. Ted Cruz if the national environment swings even more in the party's favor.  The big one not listed here: Utah The most interesting Senate race in 2018 might have nothing to do with whether Republicans or Democrats control the chamber after this year's midterm elections.  The decision by Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah to retire has teed up Mitt Romney -- the 2012 Republican presidential nominee turned leading intra-party critic of President Donald Trump -- to run for a job that would give him major influence over the remainder of Trump's presidency.   But Hatch is a Republican. Romney is a Republican. And if Romney is stopped, it'll be because another Republican won the nomination in Utah. It'll be a fascinating state to watch -- but it won't tip the partisan balance of the Senate.

The fundraising gap is yet another sign that the GOP is struggling to take advantage of a map ripe with Democratic incumbents in red states.  The good news for Republicans: Their tax bill is more popular than it was weeks ago, polls show. And Vice President Mike Pence showed some teeth on a trip to West Virginia , previewing a more aggressive line of attack  from President Donald Trump's administration against Democratic incumbents.  In this year's midterm elections, Democrats -- or independents who caucus with them -- are defending 26 seats, while Republicans are defending just eight. The GOP has a 51-49 advantage in the Senate at the moment.  Here are 10 Senate seats most likely to switch party hands in this year's midterms, as of February 2018: 1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller Heller raised just $820,000 in 2017's fourth quarter. That's bad -- particularly for an incumbent.  The Democratic candidate, Rep. Jacky Rosen, hauled in more than $1.5 million, helping her close Heller's $4.2 million to $1.8 million cash on hand advantage. And Heller still has to contend with Republican primary challenger Danny Tarkanian.  RELATED: Trump tells RNC members he'll campaign for Dean Heller in Nevada, will visit other states This is the only state on this list that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. It's diverse, Democrats there are organized and  Heller's gymnastics on health care  are sure to provide fodder for attack ads targeting him. 2. Arizona Open seat (Republican Sen. Jeff Flake is retiring) GOP Rep. Martha McSally is in a tough spot when it comes to Trump.  She  told the Los Angeles Times it's \"not your business\"  whether she voted for him in 2016, and she  recently attended a fundraiser  hosted by Randy Kendrick, who funded a \"Never Trump\" super PAC. But she's also backing a hard-line GOP approach to immigration.   McSally is trying to navigate through a primary against state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio while preserving some room to pivot for the general election.  The biggest problem for Republicans here is that the primary is August 28 -- which means the winner won't have much time to turn to Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (who now has $5.1 million in the bank) before November.  3. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill Is Josh Hawley ready for prime time? The GOP's prized recruit of the 2018 cycle raised just shy of $1 million in 2017's fourth quarter and has $1.2 million on hand -- far short of McCaskill's $2.9 million quarter and $9 million war chest.  The 38-year-old Missouri attorney general was also taped  blaming the cultural revolution of the 1960s for sex trafficking  -- an odd linkage that's shaken up the race in recent days.  It led Democrats to chirp that Hawley demonstrated why he's a less frequent presence on the campaign trail than McCaskill, who held 51 town hall events last year.  Still, Trump won Missouri by 19 percentage points. That's a big hole for McCaskill to climb out of. 4. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Republicans are split over whether they really want to brand Donnelly as \"Mexico Joe.\"   The national GOP loves blasting Donnelly over reports that a family business outsourced jobs to Mexico so much that the National Republican Senatorial Committee sent a mariachi band to troll him at a campaign stop in August. But Gov. Eric Holcomb and the Indiana Republican Party saw the stunt as offensive and aren't taking part in the line of attack.  Republicans face a bitter, competitive primary between Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and former state Rep. Mike Braun that won't be settled until May.  In the meantime, it's worth paying close attention to whether poll numbers for the GOP's tax bill continue to rise. At the Republican National Committee's winter meeting in Washington, one Hoosier said Donnelly could have iced this race by voting for the tax bill, and speculated that he'll ultimately regret his vote against it.   5. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Manchin might have come out on top of his recent rumble with Vice President Mike Pence when he labeled Pence's attacks on his vote against the tax bill \"why Washington Sucks.\" (Yes, he capitalized the S.)  But Pence sent an important signal by hitting Manchin hard in his home state: The Trump administration is ready and willing to burn its bridges with even the friendliest Democratic senators in order to take their seats this fall.  Manchin, after all, stood and applauded during Trump's State of the Union when other Democratic senators sat on their hands.  This is another race where a crowded, nasty, personal GOP primary will sort itself out in May. Rep. Evan Jenkins, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and former coal baron Don Blankenship -- who was in prison just last year for conspiracy to commit mine safety violations -- are all running.  6. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp The fourth in our run of five consecutive Democratic-held seat where Trump won by double digits in 2016, this race just got a little more crowded with former state GOP chair Gary Emineth entering the race. He joins state Sen. Tom Campbell in a Republican contest that the national GOP is disappointed Rep. Kevin Cramer decided not to enter.  Remember Trump calling Heitkamp a \"good woman\" last year, on stage with the television cameras rolling? It's another reason why it was so important for Pence to show he's willing to give Republicans much tougher tape to use against Democratic incumbents.  7. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Tester was the only one of the five Democratic incumbents in states Trump won by double digits to vote against the continuing resolution that ended the government shutdown.  It was a risky vote, sure -- but also a reflection of the confidence Democrats have that he can hold this seat against the likes of state auditor Matt Rosendale or businessman Troy Downing.  8. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Baldwin is a top target of the Koch brothers, who plan to spend $400 million in this year's midterms. They'll try to use her vote against the tax bill to portray Baldwin as too liberal. And with Gov. Scott Walker up for re-election, his effective state party machinery will be running at full steam, benefiting Republicans up and down the ballot.  State Sen. Leah Vukmir and businessman Kevin Nicholson are in a competitive (and likely expensive) GOP primary. 9. Florida Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson Wake us up when Rick Scott makes up his mind.  The term-limited governor currently in his last year could announce whether he'll run for the Senate in March, after Florida's state legislative session wraps up and just before the filing deadline.  If he's in, this is a marquee race and Democrats might have to spend heavily to defend the seat. If he's out, that money could be scattered to the states that are higher on the list -- where the media markets are smaller and the advertising dollar goes much farther.  10. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown State treasurer Josh Mandel's surprise withdrawal left Republicans with Rep. Jim Renacci and investment banker and major donor Mike Gibbons to take on the populist progressive Brown, who has $10 million in the bank and a little 2020 presidential buzz following him.  This is a state Trump won by 9 percentage points in 2016 -- so a rise in Trump's approval rating would make Brown uncomfortable.  Just missed  Increasingly, it looks like Texas -- not Tennessee -- represents Democrats' best chance at putting a third GOP-held seat in play.  Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke actually outraised Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2017's fourth quarter, hauling in $2.4 million to Cruz's $1.9 million. That means Cruz's cash on hand advantage is down to $7.3 million to O'Rourke's $4.6 million -- nowhere near the insurmountable gap many expected.  Hotline's Josh Kraushaar  convincingly made the case  for a close Texas race in part by pointing to three competitive House contests that will engage voters in the Dallas, Houston and San Antonio media markets.  Yes, there's a Lucy-with-the-football element at play for Democrats in Texas. For years, they've thought they could win there -- and for years, their best candidates ultimately haven't even been able to make Republicans sweat. But elections in recent months have shown that diverse states with expansive suburbs are rapidly moving leftward. It makes Texas one to watch closely.    In Tennessee, we're still waiting to see whether former Gov. Phil Bredesen has shaken off the dust and is headed into an open-seat contest where he'll likely face Rep. Marsha Blackburn.  In Pennsylvania, Republicans are concerned about the campaign of Rep. Lou Barletta -- a Trump ally in a year when that's a politically problematic label. And in Minnesota, newly appointed Sen. Tina Smith has not yet drawn a high-profile Republican opponent. State Sen. Karin Housley looks like the leading GOP contender.","articles_date":"5 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/05\/politics\/senate-race-rankings-february\/index.html","articles_title":"The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2018: February edition","candidate_fk":5,"first_name":"Patrick","id":259,"issue":8,"last_name":"Morrisey","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Republican primaries -- everywhere.  The GOP's Senate recruiting challenges -- failing to land candidates in some states, attracting too many candidates in others, while two vulnerable incumbents are also targeted from within -- mean the party faces a long list of internal battles. Only after those are settled can the GOP fully turn its attention to unseating Senate Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections.  The across-the-board primary battles are complicating what should be a hugely advantageous map for Republicans. Democratic senators are running for re-election in 10 -- that's right, 10 -- states that President Donald Trump won in 2016. The GOP, meanwhile, only has two members who currently look like they could be in real jeopardy.  At stake is control of the Senate, where the GOP currently holds 52 of 100 seats.  Here is CNN's first Senate race ranking of the 10 seats most likely to flip in 2018:  1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller It's one of the earliest races to take shape -- and it's all bad news for Heller.  Danny Tarkanian, who has lost five campaigns over the last decade but won the GOP nomination in four of those five races,  is taking on Heller in the Republican primary . And Rep.  Jacky Rosen  was hand-picked by Harry Reid to challenge Heller in the general election.    Heller also cast a potentially damaging vote for the Senate GOP's health care bill, sticking with party leadership (and with Trump, who had said while sitting beside Heller at a meeting before the vote: \"He wants to remain a senator, doesn't he?\") Still, that vote could haunt Heller in 2018 -- particularly because it looked like a flip-flop after Heller stood weeks earlier with popular Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval at a news conference and denounced the House's version of the Obamacare repeal effort. He has also delivered confusing and contradictory answers on whether he supports Planned Parenthood funding.  The health care gymnastics complicate what already looked like a tough race. Heller was elected with just 46% of the vote in 2012. Four years later, Nevada was among the only swing states to favor Hillary Clinton over Trump.  2. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill Missouri attorney general  Josh Hawley  is moving toward a run against McCaskill. He's well-regarded by donors and operatives. And now that several Republicans who were widely expected to run, including Rep. Ann Wagner, have decided against entering the race, he could be looking at a clearer field.  Deepening Democrats' concerns is that Missouri is rapidly moving rightward. Trump won the state with 57% support last year, and Sen. Roy Blunt was re-elected despite Missouri secretary of state Jason Kander running perhaps the best Democratic Senate campaign of the entire cycle.  The Republican tilt and Hawley's status as a top-tier challenger make this perhaps the GOP's strongest pick-up opportunity.  3. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Just like McCaskill benefited from Todd Akin's now-infamous comments about \" legitimate rape \" in 2012, Donnelly benefitted when his Republican opponent, state treasurer Richard Mourdock, asserted in a debate that pregnancies resulting from rape  are \"God's will.\"   Neither of the two Republicans running against Donnelly -- Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita -- are likely to make such a mistake in 2018.  However, this primary battle will be nasty and personal. Rokita and Messer have already called each other \"unhinged.\" Rokita attacked Messer for moving his family to Washington after being elected to Congress, and criticized a contract Messer's wife has for part-time legal work for the city of Fishers.  Already, it has split Trump world, with Trump supporters in the state backing Rokita while Pence's allies are behind Messer. Democrats' hope is that their fight leaves the winner politically damaged headed into the fall.  4. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin If you had any doubt about this state's heavily Republican leanings, Gov. Jim Justice erased it  when he switched parties  at a rally alongside Trump -- who carried West Virginia with 68% of the vote -- last week.  But Manchin isn't your average Democrat.  Perhaps more than any other senator, he was helped by Trump's victory. A world in which Manchin spent two years casting votes for a Clinton agenda would have put him in much graver danger than one where he has kept a cordial relationship with Trump and maintained his own centrist brand, while enjoying the freedom to oppose the GOP's politically unpopular health care effort.   RELATED - Joe Manchin: 'Don't give a s--t' about attacks Republicans have multiple potentially serious challengers here. That list includes  Rep. Evan Jenkins , another party-switching former Democrat, and attorney general Patrick Morrisey -- whose wife's firm's lobbying work for Planned Parenthood and a pro-gun control group could become a target during an intense primary. 5. Arizona Incumbent: Republican Sen. Jeff Flake Before Flake can even worry about a Democratic challenger, he has to sweat a potentially formidable primary from his own party.  Flake's publication of  an anti-Trump conservative tome  has state treasurer Jeff DeWit and former Arizona Republican chairman Robert Graham both looking hard at a run against him. And Trump, who pledged in the fall to spend $10 million of his own money to unseat Flake, is clearly holding the grudge -- with DeWit and Graham both in regular contact with the White House.  Flake: Trump's immigration plan 'isn't the right direction for the economy' If Flake makes it to the general election, his willingness to criticize Trump could appeal to moderate voters. But Democrats will contrast him with Arizona Sen. John McCain and argue that while McCain cast a vote on health care that actually stymied Trump's agenda, Flake has  voted with the President on key issues .  Still, it's a red-leaning state. And while Democrats expect a strong challenger -- Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton are usually the first names to come up -- they don't have one yet.  6. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Tester is up for re-election in a state where Trump won 56% of the vote. So it seemed like a major pickup opportunity for Republicans -- that is, until Greg Gianforte  body-slammed a reporter  on the eve of his special election victory in a House race. You're saying: Wait, what?  Here's how it's all connected: Gianforte was a top prospect to run for Montana governor in 2020. But after his body-slam of The Guardian's Ben Jacobs, he's seen politically as damaged goods. So Montana attorney general Tim Fox -- who was likely to run against Tester -- now has his eyes on the governor's office instead.  Republicans already lost their top Montana recruit when Rep. Ryan Zinke  was named Trump's interior secretary . Fox's decision not to run against Tester -- again, because he's eyeing the governor's office instead -- cost the GOP their second-best option.  Now, Republicans have turned to state auditor Matt Rosendale to take on Tester in the battle of the two best flat-tops in politics.  Something to watch with Rosendale: Billings Judge Russell Fagg, who is considering entering the race, recently  took a shot  at Rosendale for moving from Maryland to Montana 16 years ago -- saying his own \"four generations of Montana roots, all the way back to the late 1800s\" make him better qualified to represent the state. 7. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp On paper, it seems Heitkamp ought to be at the very top of this list. She's a Democrat who barely eked out a victory in 2012 running for re-election in a state where Trump won 64% of the vote.  However, Heitkamp -- who hasn't officially announced she's running for re-election herself, but is fundraising like a candidate -- has $3 million in the bank, she's held events all across a state with a small enough population that retail politics works, and she doesn't have a Republican opponent.  The most buzzed-about prospects are state Sen. Tom Campbell and Rep. Kevin Cramer. But until one -- or another Republican with a profile in North Dakota and\/or money to spend -- jumps in, Heitkamp is in a strong position.  8. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Unseating Baldwin didn't get any easier when Rep. Sean Duffy, perhaps Republicans' strongest potential recruit, decided against running.  So far, Marine Corps veteran and businessman Kevin Nicholson is in the race, while state Sen. Leah Vukmir, businessman Eric Hovde and others are weighing bids of their own.  Boosting Republicans' prospects here is a strong, battle-tested party built by Gov. Scott Walker, who has won three gubernatorial elections already.   9. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown The well-known Brown's populist, anti-free trade brand fits Ohio's white working-class voters better than Hillary Clinton's message did in 2016. But this is still a state where Trump won by 9 percentage points. Brown is headed into a likely rematch against state treasurer Josh Mandel. Why this is a precarious race for Brown: Mandel has $3.3 million in the bank and national Republicans have shown they are willing to spend heavily on Ohio -- even to back a candidate they don't love.  10. Florida Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson This one's all about Florida Gov. Rick Scott. In an extraordinarily expensive state, Scott -- whose term as governor ends next year -- could pump tens of millions of his own dollars into a race against the tough, well-known incumbent Nelson. Scott is clearly interested in maintaining a voice in national politics. In May, he launched his \"New Republican\" super PAC. And Trump has lobbied Scott to run against Nelson.  The question is whether the two-term executive is interested in being just one of 100 -- and the junior senator to Florida's Marco Rubio.  If Scott enters the race, this one rockets up the list. Honorable mention In Pennsylvania, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is waiting to see how the Republican field shakes out in a state Trump narrowly won in 2016. Meanwhile, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was actually outraised by Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke in 2017's second quarter -- showing that, if things really break right for Democrats, O'Rourke could be an online fundraising darling headed into the fall of 2018.

The problem for Republicans: He doesn't seem interested in using his power for the party's good.  From labeling a top Democratic target a \"good woman\" to tacitly approving of his former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon's aggressive courtship of Republicans to run in the primary against sitting senators, the Trump factor is proving problematic as midterm election season heats up.   Here's a look, more than a year out, at the 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties in the November 2018 midterms:  1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller  Primary date: June 12 In a health care battle that hurt Republicans politically, Heller's reversals and contortions were uniquely damaging.  His maneuvers -- he was against one GOP health care bill, then for another one -- looked like a result of the pinch Heller is feeling from both sides. On the right, Danny Tarkanian -- 0-for-5 in the general election in his runs for office but 4-for-5 in Republican primaries -- says Heller hasn't sufficiently supported Trump. On the left, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen says he's been there when Trump and congressional Republicans needed him.   Nevada was a rare swing state to go Hillary Clinton's direction in 2016. Heller only won by a nose in 2012 -- and the health care debacle makes this state the most likely to flip next year.  2. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill Primary date: August 7 Running for re-election as a Democrat in a state Trump won by 19 points is tough enough. Now, McCaskill faces the challenger national Republicans had hoped to recruit into the race: state attorney general Josh Hawley, who officially launched his campaign last week.  Worse news for McCaskill: At the outset, Hawley seems to have the backing of both the McConnell and Bannon crowds -- making a competitive primary that would siphon away resources less likely.  McCaskill starts from a major financial advantage. She raised nearly $3 million in 2017's third quarter and has $7 million in the bank, to Hawley's $820,000 third-quarter haul. Still, at this stage in the 2018 cycle, she looks like the Democratic incumbent in the most jeopardy.  So why isn't she first on the list? Because of this: You can't yet name a single tough vote Trump and congressional Republicans have forced her to take. It's a reality that helps every Democratic incumbent on this list. 3. Arizona Incumbent: Republican Sen. Jeff Flake Primary date: August 28 If the question was which senator is most likely to lose, Flake would be first -- by a lot. His support from Republicans has so thoroughly collapsed that the question that looms largest is simply whether he'll even appear on the ballot.    Democrats have the candidate they hoped for in Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. But Arizona still favors Republicans, and whoever emerges from the GOP's primary will stand a chance at keeping the seat -- even if it's Kelli Ward, whose history of controversial statements would be fodder for endless attack ads.  For now, Ward is the only Republican running against Flake. And several groups' internal polls there show Ward crushing him. But the possibility of other candidates entering before the late-August 2018 primary, and the bigger question of Sen. John McCain's health, add heavy doses of uncertainty to this race.  4. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Primary date: May 8 Donnelly is a ripe target: He gambled entering the 2012 race against Sen. Richard Lugar, got lucky when Lugar lost in a primary to state treasurer Richard Mourdock, and then hit the jackpot when Mourdock flubbed a question about pregnancies resulting from rape in a debate just before the election.  None of the leading Republican candidates this time around -- Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and state Rep. Mike Braun -- are likely to commit such a gaffe.  This is another race that features two major themes: (1) It's happening in a state where Trump cruised in 2016, and (2) Republicans are heading into what could be an expensive, brutal primary.  The first factor lands Indiana high on the list. The second one keeps it from climbing higher -- for now.  5. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Primary date: May 8 It's getting lonely for Manchin in West Virginia.  Trump won the state by 42 points. Then the governor who'd been elected as a Democrat stood with Trump at a rally and declared that he was becoming a Republican.  Manchin, a former governor himself, knows his state. He's played the politics of the Trump era well, playing footsie with the administration over a Cabinet post and sounding open to compromise on issues like taxes. Like every other Democrat on this list, he's helped by Republicans failing to make him pay any price at all for voting against their bills. But serious GOP challengers are lining up to take him on, and the D beside his name might be too much for Manchin to overcome in such a conservative state.  6. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Primary date: June 12 Want a 10-second explanation of why Trump drives Republicans whose job is to expand the party's Senate majority crazy? Cue up the tape of Trump, who had flown Heitkamp to his event in North Dakota in early September on Air Force One, pointing her out and saying: \"Everyone's saying: What's she doing up here? But I'll tell you what: Good woman.\" What better gift could Trump give a Democrat running for re-election in a state he won by 36 points?  Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer, who is thinking about challenging Heitkamp, was on stage for that moment, and got no special mention. State Sen. Tom Campbell is in the race. But Heitkamp raised more than $1 million in the third quarter, has almost $4 million on hand and the President seeming to like her is going to matter.   7. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown Primary date: May 8 The 2016 election ended Ohio's status as the marquee swing state -- with Trump's eight-point margin of victory there making places like North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia look like potentially better targets for national Democrats.  When it comes to connecting with voters' sense of economic anxiety, the populist, anti-trade Brown has a lot in common with Trump. He also heads into a likely matchup against state treasurer Josh Mandel, who Brown already beat head-to-head in 2012.  This race should be a good test of whether Trump's popularity transfers to other Republicans -- or whether it was really his economic message that won the day in Ohio.  8. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Primary date: June 5 Tester is raising lots of money -- $1.2 million in the third quarter, with more than $5 million on hand -- and railing against \"Washington,\" not Trump.  Yes, Montana was a state Trump won by 20 points. But Gov. Steve Bullock also proved last year that a Democrat can win statewide here. And Republicans haven't yet been able to cast a man with a flat-top who still farms on the weekends as an out-of-touch liberal elitist.  The GOP primary bears watching -- in part because it's shaping up as a proxy war between interior secretary Ryan Zinke, whose wife is involved with Troy Downing's campaign, and Sen. Steve Daines, who is aligned with state auditor Matt Rosendale.  9. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Primary date: August 14 Baldwin is all that's standing in the way of Republicans' total takeover of Wisconsin's statewide seats -- and she'll be on the ballot at the same time the engine that drove Gov. Scott Walker's victories in two gubernatorial races and a recall election is trying to win him a third term.  But the Republican primary field is unsettled. State Sen. Leah Vukmir and businessman Kevin Nicholson could pose serious challenges.  One big question: Was Trump's win in 2016 a surprise that'll quickly be reversed, or the tipping point in what had been Wisconsin's slow rightward drift?  10. Florida Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson Primary date: August 28 This is all about Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who can throw tons of his own money into a Senate race that Trump and other party leaders desperately want to see him enter. If he does, this becomes a high-profile race in a marquee swing state, and has all the ingredients of a close, expensive and brutal contest. Scott's handling of Hurricane Irma -- and particularly a nursing home  where 12 patients died  -- would come under serious scrutiny.  For now, this race barely makes the cut. But if Scott gets in, expect it to jump much higher.  Honorable mention Two more Democrats, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, are among the safest swing-state incumbents. And Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow appears to be in good position -- though rap-rock musician Kid Rock (ballot name: Robert Ritchie) wants people to think he might run against her.  In New Jersey, Sen. Robert Menendez is on a different kind of hot seat -- in the middle of a corruption trial.   If a true anti-Trump wave breaks against the Republicans, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could find himself in a competitive race against Rep. Beto O'Rourke. And whichever Republican is nominated to replace Sen. Bob Corker in Tennessee -- right now, Rep. Marsha Blackburn looks like the front-runner -- could face a tough test.  One that should be on your radar: Mississippi. Republican Sen. Roger Wicker is likely to face a Steve Bannon-backed primary challenger. State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who nearly knocked off Sen. Thad Cochran in a primary in 2014, is seriously considering the race. Democrats wonder if the GOP primary might turn this state into competitive ground just like Alabama, where controversial former judge Roy Moore faces a surprisingly serious competitor in Democrat Doug Jones in a December special election.

And Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow appears to be in good position -- though rap-rock musician Kid Rock (ballot name: Robert Ritchie) wants people to think he might run against her.  In New Jersey, Sen. Robert Menendez is on a different kind of hot seat -- in the middle of a corruption trial.   If a true anti-Trump wave breaks against the Republicans, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could find himself in a competitive race against Rep. Beto O'Rourke. And whichever Republican is nominated to replace Sen. Bob Corker in Tennessee -- right now, Rep. Marsha Blackburn looks like the front-runner -- could face a tough test.  One that should be on your radar: Mississippi. Republican Sen. Roger Wicker is likely to face a Steve Bannon-backed primary challenger. State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who nearly knocked off Sen. Thad Cochran in a primary in 2014, is seriously considering the race. Democrats wonder if the GOP primary might turn this state into competitive ground just like Alabama, where controversial former judge Roy Moore faces a surprisingly serious competitor in Democrat Doug Jones in a December special election.

The problem for Republicans: He doesn't seem interested in using his power for the party's good.  From labeling a top Democratic target a \"good woman\" to tacitly approving of his former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon's aggressive courtship of Republicans to run in the primary against sitting senators, the Trump factor is proving problematic as midterm election season heats up.   Here's a look, more than a year out, at the 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties in the November 2018 midterms:  1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller  Primary date: June 12 In a health care battle that hurt Republicans politically, Heller's reversals and contortions were uniquely damaging.  His maneuvers -- he was against one GOP health care bill, then for another one -- looked like a result of the pinch Heller is feeling from both sides. On the right, Danny Tarkanian -- 0-for-5 in the general election in his runs for office but 4-for-5 in Republican primaries -- says Heller hasn't sufficiently supported Trump. On the left, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen says he's been there when Trump and congressional Republicans needed him.   Nevada was a rare swing state to go Hillary Clinton's direction in 2016. Heller only won by a nose in 2012 -- and the health care debacle makes this state the most likely to flip next year.  2. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill Primary date: August 7 Running for re-election as a Democrat in a state Trump won by 19 points is tough enough. Now, McCaskill faces the challenger national Republicans had hoped to recruit into the race: state attorney general Josh Hawley, who officially launched his campaign last week.  Worse news for McCaskill: At the outset, Hawley seems to have the backing of both the McConnell and Bannon crowds -- making a competitive primary that would siphon away resources less likely.  McCaskill starts from a major financial advantage. She raised nearly $3 million in 2017's third quarter and has $7 million in the bank, to Hawley's $820,000 third-quarter haul. Still, at this stage in the 2018 cycle, she looks like the Democratic incumbent in the most jeopardy.  So why isn't she first on the list? Because of this: You can't yet name a single tough vote Trump and congressional Republicans have forced her to take. It's a reality that helps every Democratic incumbent on this list. 3. Arizona Incumbent: Republican Sen. Jeff Flake Primary date: August 28 If the question was which senator is most likely to lose, Flake would be first -- by a lot. His support from Republicans has so thoroughly collapsed that the question that looms largest is simply whether he'll even appear on the ballot.    Democrats have the candidate they hoped for in Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. But Arizona still favors Republicans, and whoever emerges from the GOP's primary will stand a chance at keeping the seat -- even if it's Kelli Ward, whose history of controversial statements would be fodder for endless attack ads.  For now, Ward is the only Republican running against Flake. And several groups' internal polls there show Ward crushing him. But the possibility of other candidates entering before the late-August 2018 primary, and the bigger question of Sen. John McCain's health, add heavy doses of uncertainty to this race.  4. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Primary date: May 8 Donnelly is a ripe target: He gambled entering the 2012 race against Sen. Richard Lugar, got lucky when Lugar lost in a primary to state treasurer Richard Mourdock, and then hit the jackpot when Mourdock flubbed a question about pregnancies resulting from rape in a debate just before the election.  None of the leading Republican candidates this time around -- Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and state Rep. Mike Braun -- are likely to commit such a gaffe.  This is another race that features two major themes: (1) It's happening in a state where Trump cruised in 2016, and (2) Republicans are heading into what could be an expensive, brutal primary.  The first factor lands Indiana high on the list. The second one keeps it from climbing higher -- for now.  5. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Primary date: May 8 It's getting lonely for Manchin in West Virginia.  Trump won the state by 42 points. Then the governor who'd been elected as a Democrat stood with Trump at a rally and declared that he was becoming a Republican.  Manchin, a former governor himself, knows his state. He's played the politics of the Trump era well, playing footsie with the administration over a Cabinet post and sounding open to compromise on issues like taxes. Like every other Democrat on this list, he's helped by Republicans failing to make him pay any price at all for voting against their bills. But serious GOP challengers are lining up to take him on, and the D beside his name might be too much for Manchin to overcome in such a conservative state.  6. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Primary date: June 12 Want a 10-second explanation of why Trump drives Republicans whose job is to expand the party's Senate majority crazy? Cue up the tape of Trump, who had flown Heitkamp to his event in North Dakota in early September on Air Force One, pointing her out and saying: \"Everyone's saying: What's she doing up here? But I'll tell you what: Good woman.\" What better gift could Trump give a Democrat running for re-election in a state he won by 36 points?  Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer, who is thinking about challenging Heitkamp, was on stage for that moment, and got no special mention. State Sen. Tom Campbell is in the race. But Heitkamp raised more than $1 million in the third quarter, has almost $4 million on hand and the President seeming to like her is going to matter.   7. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown Primary date: May 8 The 2016 election ended Ohio's status as the marquee swing state -- with Trump's eight-point margin of victory there making places like North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia look like potentially better targets for national Democrats.  When it comes to connecting with voters' sense of economic anxiety, the populist, anti-trade Brown has a lot in common with Trump. He also heads into a likely matchup against state treasurer Josh Mandel, who Brown already beat head-to-head in 2012.  This race should be a good test of whether Trump's popularity transfers to other Republicans -- or whether it was really his economic message that won the day in Ohio.  8. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Primary date: June 5 Tester is raising lots of money -- $1.2 million in the third quarter, with more than $5 million on hand -- and railing against \"Washington,\" not Trump.  Yes, Montana was a state Trump won by 20 points. But Gov. Steve Bullock also proved last year that a Democrat can win statewide here. And Republicans haven't yet been able to cast a man with a flat-top who still farms on the weekends as an out-of-touch liberal elitist.  The GOP primary bears watching -- in part because it's shaping up as a proxy war between interior secretary Ryan Zinke, whose wife is involved with Troy Downing's campaign, and Sen. Steve Daines, who is aligned with state auditor Matt Rosendale.  9. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Primary date: August 14 Baldwin is all that's standing in the way of Republicans' total takeover of Wisconsin's statewide seats -- and she'll be on the ballot at the same time the engine that drove Gov. Scott Walker's victories in two gubernatorial races and a recall election is trying to win him a third term.  But the Republican primary field is unsettled. State Sen. Leah Vukmir and businessman Kevin Nicholson could pose serious challenges.  One big question: Was Trump's win in 2016 a surprise that'll quickly be reversed, or the tipping point in what had been Wisconsin's slow rightward drift?  10. Florida Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson Primary date: August 28 This is all about Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who can throw tons of his own money into a Senate race that Trump and other party leaders desperately want to see him enter. If he does, this becomes a high-profile race in a marquee swing state, and has all the ingredients of a close, expensive and brutal contest. Scott's handling of Hurricane Irma -- and particularly a nursing home  where 12 patients died  -- would come under serious scrutiny.  For now, this race barely makes the cut. But if Scott gets in, expect it to jump much higher.  Honorable mention Two more Democrats, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, are among the safest swing-state incumbents.

For the five Democrats defending seats in states President Donald Trump won in 2016 by double-digits, the issue is complicated: Their national party and donors want gun restrictions, but the right-of-center, exurban and rural voters they'll need to win have historically opposed tighter gun laws. They'll have to decide how far they can go, and how they can sell it.  For some Republicans, particularly Florida Gov. Rick Scott, it's a different problem: They'll be accused of ignoring opportunities to act on gun violence before the shooting in Parkland, Florida.  As we wait to see how the gun debate evolves in statehouses and on Capitol Hill, here's our March edition of the 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties in November.   Remember: The current balance of power in the Senate is 51 Republicans, 49 Democrats (and independents who caucus with them). That means Democrats need a net gain of two seats to take control of the chamber. That's a tough task on a map where Democrats are defending 26 seats and Republicans just have to hold eight. 1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller Primary date: June 12 Heller tops this list for two reasons: He's the only Republican up for re-election in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and unlike the split fields we see in other states, he has dangerous one-on-one matchups in both the primary (against Danny Tarkanian) and the general election (against Rep. Jacky Rosen).  The good news for Heller: President Donald Trump wants to help him. Trump  told Republican National Committee members  he'll go to Nevada to campaign for Heller ahead of the primary. (And if Trump forgets that promise, the fact that  Tarkanian used Ivanka Trump against Heller  will probably serve as a strong reminder.)  The bad news: Cozying up to Trump is a problem in a general election.  2. Arizona Incumbent: Open seat (Republican Sen. Jeff Flake is retiring) Primary date: August 28 In a year of Republican primaries all over the map, this one has the makings to be the nation's most chaotic.  Rep. Martha McSally spent much of the last month backing away from her 2016 criticism of Trump. Former state Sen. Kelli Ward  was in Washington for CPAC  courting major donors and organizations for a well-financed brawl. And former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio is a wild card who could spoil the entire race for Republicans if he wins the primary.   With the primary still months away, Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is watching and waiting.  Flake, meanwhile, is off to New Hampshire for an event later this month, kicking up 2020 presidential speculation.  3. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill Primary date: August 7 Republican attorney general Josh Hawley has played the scandal surrounding  indicted  Gov. Eric Greitens carefully, breaking with the Missouri GOP in calling for an investigation and tweeting that there is \"no place for party or partisanship.\"  Still, Greitens' seemingly inevitable downfall is bad for the party's brand. Navigating those choppy waters -- ideally as quickly as possible -- is important for Hawley's Senate prospects in a state Trump won by 19 points in 2016.  4. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Primary date: May 8 In the three-way Republican primary between Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and former state Rep. Mike Braun, it's Rokita who wields the sharpest knife.  His opening line in their first debate got at both Braun's past participation in Democratic primaries and questions surrounding Messer's residency. \"Mike, welcome to the Republican Party,\" Rokita said. \"Luke, welcome back to Indiana.\" Rokita's all-base, all-the-time strategy was on vivid display in his first TV ad: 5. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Primary date: May 8 Manchin tried an odd idea last month: He  urged other senators to sign a pledge  not to campaign against each other.  It seemed like a self-serving proposal by a former governor who, while in that job, was chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, an organization with the sole job of defeating Republican governors.  Even if senators stay out of it, others are willing to wade in. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker endorsed attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who along with Rep. Evan Jenkins and coal CEO Don Blankenship are running to oppose Manchin. 6. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Primary date: June 12 Republicans got good news when Rep. Kevin Cramer changed his mind and decided he'd run against Heitkamp after all.  The cherry on top: There won't be a GOP primary. State Sen. Tom Campbell, who was also in the race, is instead running for Cramer's House seat.  Heitkamp will benefit from footage of Trump extending a handshake and calling her a \"good woman\" on stage at a September event. But there are good reasons Republicans consider this a top target: Trump won the state by 36 points in 2016. And Heitkamp won her seat by less than a point in 2012. Heitkamp is still well-funded and hasn't had to cast many tough votes (with tax reform being a possible exception), and there remain questions about Cramer's strength as a candidate. But this race looks better for Republicans now than it did a month ago.   7. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Primary date: June 5 Last in a string of five straight Democratic-held seats in states Trump won by double digits, Tester is watching and waiting to see how the GOP primary develops.  State auditor Matt Rosendale, the other Senate candidate with a flat-top, appears to be the Republican front-runner, with businessman Troy Downing, former judge Russell Fagg and state Sen. Al Olszewski are also in the race.  8. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Primary date: August 14 Many families dislike the political life. But rarely do you see the parents of a candidate -- Republican businessman Kevin Nicholson --  give the maximum possible donations to his Democratic opponent , Baldwin.  Nicholson has challenged state Sen. Leah Vukmir to six debates in a primary that is still developing. Businessman Eric Hovde is also exploring a run.  The first debate is set for March 28 hosted by WTMJ-AM and being broadcast on the radio.  9. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown Primary date: May 8 Here's the counterintuitive case for Republicans having a shot here:  When state treasurer Josh Mandel dropped out, the assumption was that Brown probably had this race in the bag. But the truth about Mandel was that Republicans never believed he'd win. They'd already seen Brown beat him once, in their 2012 head-to-head.  At least Rep. Jim Renacci, the front-runner for the nomination, gives the GOP a bit of a clean slate. He's capable of self-funding at least partially in an expensive state, too.  As Ohio drifts rightward, it's possible this one will be harder for Democrats to put away than they'd like.  10. Florida Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson Primary date: August 28 In the wake of the Parkland shooting, Nelson is showing that he's ready for a fight against Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican who is widely expected to announce a Senate run in the near future.  In a CNN town hall on guns,  Nelson linked Scott's inaction  in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando to the Parkland shooting.  \"Two years ago, when 49 lives were taken in the Pulse nightclub, and nothing was done -- not in Washington, not in Tallahassee, not one thing offered by the administration in Tallahassee,\" he said. \"And here we are, going through this again. And it's going to unfortunately very possibly continue unless we get some common-sense laws on the books.\" ","articles_date":"4 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/01\/politics\/senate-race-rankings-march\/index.html","articles_title":"The 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties: March edition","candidate_fk":1,"first_name":"Don","id":265,"issue":8,"last_name":"Blankenship","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) The national debate over gun control has thrown a new dynamic into this year's top Senate races.

Eric Greitens carefully, breaking with the Missouri GOP in calling for an investigation and tweeting that there is \"no place for party or partisanship.\"  Still, Greitens' seemingly inevitable downfall is bad for the party's brand. Navigating those choppy waters -- ideally as quickly as possible -- is important for Hawley's Senate prospects in a state Trump won by 19 points in 2016.  4. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Primary date: May 8 In the three-way Republican primary between Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and former state Rep. Mike Braun, it's Rokita who wields the sharpest knife.  His opening line in their first debate got at both Braun's past participation in Democratic primaries and questions surrounding Messer's residency. \"Mike, welcome to the Republican Party,\" Rokita said. \"Luke, welcome back to Indiana.\" Rokita's all-base, all-the-time strategy was on vivid display in his first TV ad: 5. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Primary date: May 8 Manchin tried an odd idea last month: He  urged other senators to sign a pledge  not to campaign against each other.  It seemed like a self-serving proposal by a former governor who, while in that job, was chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, an organization with the sole job of defeating Republican governors.  Even if senators stay out of it, others are willing to wade in. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker endorsed attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who along with Rep. Evan Jenkins and coal CEO Don Blankenship are running to oppose Manchin. 6. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Primary date: June 12 Republicans got good news when Rep. Kevin Cramer changed his mind and decided he'd run against Heitkamp after all.  The cherry on top: There won't be a GOP primary. State Sen. Tom Campbell, who was also in the race, is instead running for Cramer's House seat.  Heitkamp will benefit from footage of Trump extending a handshake and calling her a \"good woman\" on stage at a September event. But there are good reasons Republicans consider this a top target: Trump won the state by 36 points in 2016. And Heitkamp won her seat by less than a point in 2012. Heitkamp is still well-funded and hasn't had to cast many tough votes (with tax reform being a possible exception), and there remain questions about Cramer's strength as a candidate. But this race looks better for Republicans now than it did a month ago.   7. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Primary date: June 5 Last in a string of five straight Democratic-held seats in states Trump won by double digits, Tester is watching and waiting to see how the GOP primary develops.  State auditor Matt Rosendale, the other Senate candidate with a flat-top, appears to be the Republican front-runner, with businessman Troy Downing, former judge Russell Fagg and state Sen. Al Olszewski are also in the race.  8. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Primary date: August 14 Many families dislike the political life. But rarely do you see the parents of a candidate -- Republican businessman Kevin Nicholson --  give the maximum possible donations to his Democratic opponent , Baldwin.  Nicholson has challenged state Sen. Leah Vukmir to six debates in a primary that is still developing. Businessman Eric Hovde is also exploring a run.  The first debate is set for March 28 hosted by WTMJ-AM and being broadcast on the radio.  9. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown Primary date: May 8 Here's the counterintuitive case for Republicans having a shot here:  When state treasurer Josh Mandel dropped out, the assumption was that Brown probably had this race in the bag. But the truth about Mandel was that Republicans never believed he'd win. They'd already seen Brown beat him once, in their 2012 head-to-head.  At least Rep. Jim Renacci, the front-runner for the nomination, gives the GOP a bit of a clean slate. He's capable of self-funding at least partially in an expensive state, too.  As Ohio drifts rightward, it's possible this one will be harder for Democrats to put away than they'd like.  10. Florida Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson Primary date: August 28 In the wake of the Parkland shooting, Nelson is showing that he's ready for a fight against Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican who is widely expected to announce a Senate run in the near future.  In a CNN town hall on guns,  Nelson linked Scott's inaction  in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando to the Parkland shooting.  \"Two years ago, when 49 lives were taken in the Pulse nightclub, and nothing was done -- not in Washington, not in Tallahassee, not one thing offered by the administration in Tallahassee,\" he said. \"And here we are, going through this again. And it's going to unfortunately very possibly continue unless we get some common-sense laws on the books.\" ","articles_date":"4 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/01\/politics\/senate-race-rankings-march\/index.html","articles_title":"The 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties: March edition","candidate_fk":3,"first_name":"Evan","id":266,"issue":8,"last_name":"Jenkins","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) The national debate over gun control has thrown a new dynamic into this year's top Senate races. For the five Democrats defending seats in states President Donald Trump won in 2016 by double-digits, the issue is complicated: Their national party and donors want gun restrictions, but the right-of-center, exurban and rural voters they'll need to win have historically opposed tighter gun laws. They'll have to decide how far they can go, and how they can sell it.  For some Republicans, particularly Florida Gov. Rick Scott, it's a different problem: They'll be accused of ignoring opportunities to act on gun violence before the shooting in Parkland, Florida.  As we wait to see how the gun debate evolves in statehouses and on Capitol Hill, here's our March edition of the 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties in November.   Remember: The current balance of power in the Senate is 51 Republicans, 49 Democrats (and independents who caucus with them). That means Democrats need a net gain of two seats to take control of the chamber. That's a tough task on a map where Democrats are defending 26 seats and Republicans just have to hold eight. 1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller Primary date: June 12 Heller tops this list for two reasons: He's the only Republican up for re-election in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and unlike the split fields we see in other states, he has dangerous one-on-one matchups in both the primary (against Danny Tarkanian) and the general election (against Rep. Jacky Rosen).  The good news for Heller: President Donald Trump wants to help him. Trump  told Republican National Committee members  he'll go to Nevada to campaign for Heller ahead of the primary. (And if Trump forgets that promise, the fact that  Tarkanian used Ivanka Trump against Heller  will probably serve as a strong reminder.)  The bad news: Cozying up to Trump is a problem in a general election.  2. Arizona Incumbent: Open seat (Republican Sen. Jeff Flake is retiring) Primary date: August 28 In a year of Republican primaries all over the map, this one has the makings to be the nation's most chaotic.  Rep. Martha McSally spent much of the last month backing away from her 2016 criticism of Trump. Former state Sen. Kelli Ward  was in Washington for CPAC  courting major donors and organizations for a well-financed brawl.

In a series of interviews with Politico's  Tim Alberta  for  a massive -- and massively entertaining -- profile of the former speaker of the House , Boehner offered his thoughts on everything from Jason Chaffetz and Jim Jordan (Does. Not. Like.) to what members of Congress should eat, to Ted Cruz (see Chaffetz and Jordan) to, yes, his smoking habits. The whole story is amazing, but what stands out is Boehner's candor. Time and time again, he tells Alberta what he really thinks about his former colleagues -- a sort of frankness that has almost entirely disappeared in politics. (Former Vice President Joe Biden, who speaks highly of Boehner to Alberta, is, like Boehner, one of the remaining practitioners of this kind of politics.) Below are the 24 most remarkable quotes from Boehner in the story. In some of them I've added a thought or two. Others are, um, self explanatory. 1. \"I've never had a hot dog for dinner in my life.\" So many questions. Does this mean Boehner has never eaten a hot dog before? Or that he just hasn't eaten one for dinner? Has he eaten a hot dog for breakfast? Lunch? Brunch?   2. \"If I was going to die from smoking cigarettes, I'd already be dead.\" Boehner smokes two packs of cigarettes a day. He is 67 years old.  3.  \"F*** Jordan. F*** Chaffetz. They're both assholes.\" That's Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah that Boehner is referring to. Jordan -- one of the founders of the House Freedom Caucus, an influential bloc of conservatives -- is someone with whom Boehner repeatedly clashed in his time as speaker. Chaffetz, who left Congress earlier this year for a job at Fox News, is talented but selfish, according to Boehner -- a \"total phony.\" 4. \"A terrorist. A legislative terrorist.\" Boehner is referring to Jordan here -- but his critique can easily be broadened to represent the sort of compromise-equals-capitulation crowd that helped push him out of office. 5. \"You're gonna be a fat-ass.\" That's Boehner's advice to Rep. Patrick McHenry when the then-speaker saw the North Carolina Republican eating an ice cream sandwich. 6. \"DeLay and I were never close. Matter of fact, half the stab wounds in my back are from him.\" Tom DeLay, who spent years as House majority whip, is not likely to be on the Boehner Christmas card list. 7. \"They're never going to see an ounce of disappointment on my face. We're just going to earn our way back.\" Boehner on his attitude after being ousted as House GOP conference chairman in the wake of the 1998 election. Also, a window into how Boehner handled his speakership amid historically large challenges presented by members of his own party. 8. \"F*** you.\" Boehner's response to Alaska GOP Rep. Don Young after Boehner says Young held a 10-inch knife to his throat in a dispute over earmarking. 9. \"He had more gay staff than anybody I knew -- at a time when it was a bit unusual.\" That's Boehner's take on the revelations that Dennis Hastert, the man under whom he served as speaker, had molested a number of young men during his days as a high school wrestling coach. That is a very odd quote. 10. \"Heritage was a respected conservative think tank, and he turned it into some half-assed political operation.\" Boehner's take on former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint. ( DeMint was removed as the head of the Heritage Foundation  earlier this year.) 11. \"It's hard to negotiate with no dick.\" Um. OK. 12. \"But that little son of a bitch got under my skin.\" Boehner on Harry Reid. Also, Reid and Boehner became \"really good friends\" after Boehner confronted him before a White House meeting. 13. \"The President, the vice president, Reid, Pelosi, they're all sitting there with the biggest s***-eating grins on their faces that you've ever seen, because they can't believe we're this f***ing stupid.'\"  Boehner was not a big fan of the 2013 government shutdown. He eventually went along with it. But he was right that the government shutdown would be blamed on Republicans. 14. \"He's the most miserable son of a bitch I've ever had to work with.\" Boehner on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whom he blames for forcing the government shutdown to benefit his own political future. 15. \"That was the worst campaign ever run.\" This is a reference to then-House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor's unsuccessful primary campaign against Dave Brat in 2014 . Cantor's loss was an absolutely stunning defeat that signaled the continued power of the tea party. According to Boehner, the Cantor loss was the end of the end for his chances of holding onto the speakership. 16. \"He's an idiot. I can't tell you what makes him tick.\" Boehner is still angry at North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, a Freedom Caucus member, for trying to force a vote on vacating the speakership. The vote never came to pass, but it was the catalyst of forcing Boehner to decide to resign. 17. \"I looked at that statue of the Virgin Mary next to St. Peter's Church, and I decided, all right, today's the day.\" Boehner's description of the day he decided to resign is pure Boehner. 18. \"So 43 says, 'Hey, are you talking to Ryan? Are you giving him advice?' I said, 'Yeah, if he calls, I give him advice.' And he texts me back: 'He needs to call you more.'\" Boehner is recounting -- to a reporter -- a text exchange with former President George W. Bush about Speaker Paul Ryan. And it's a text that doesn't paint Ryan in a good light. Amazing. 19. \"You're a p****.\" Boehner is telling a story about how the 43rd President wouldn't join Burning Tree -- a male-only golf club in Maryland -- because of the optics of a president doing so. This is how Boehner viewed Bush's decision. 20. \"Donald Trump's not a Republican. He's not a Democrat. He's a populist. He doesn't have an ideological bone in his body.\" This is 100% right. 21. \"They'll be talking about the end of the two-party system.\" Boehner's prediction of how his speakership will be remembered is ominous. 22. \"What a s***show.\"  Boehner on the current state of politics. 23. \"I called him and said, 'Listen, you're nuts.'\" This conversation between Boehner and conservative mouthpiece Sean Hannity must have been a doozy. 24. \"But you can't force the big guy to give you an answer.\" Boehner responding to a question about whether he has found a purpose in life. The answer is \"no.\" But he is still waiting for a sign.","articles_date":"1 11 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/11\/01\/politics\/john-boehner-quotes\/index.html","articles_title":"The 24 most amazing John Boehner quotes in one amazing John Boehner story","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":269,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) As Congress reconvenes after a holiday weekend in their first day back at the Capitol, there's one thing on everyone's mind: Will there be a shutdown? Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's Democratic whip, who's taken the lead on immigration negotiations for his party in the chamber, was asked Tuesday afternoon if he could support a short-term spending bill that did not include a plan to protect recipients of  the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program .  Durbin told reporters \"we'll wait and see,\" a telling sign that perhaps the most watched Democrat on the issue refused to say if he would vote to shut down the government over it.  Should House Republicans have the votes for their spending bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will need at least nine Democrats to vote \"yes\" again on a short-term funding bill -- or more, depending on whether any Republicans vote against the continuing resolution or are absent due to health reasons. RELATED: Your guide to Congress' 'high stakes game of chicken' While Durbin seemed to signal the decision hasn't been made yet, some Democrats have made it clear they won't support a measure to continue funding the government without a guarantee there is a plan on the way to protect hundreds of thousands of young DACA recipients, as the program expires in March. The 16 Democrats who voted for the last stopgap bill to keep the government funded could be a good starting point to predict the outcome this week. After they voted for the bill, many of them -- some who are facing tough re-election campaigns this year -- were hammered by immigration advocates and the Democratic base for doing just that.  Those Democratic senators are:  Tom Carper of Delaware Chris Coons of Delaware  Joe Donnelly of Indiana  Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire  Martin Heinrich of New Mexico Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota  Tim Kaine of Virginia  Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats  Patrick Leahy of Vermont  Joe Manchin of West Virginia  Claire McCaskill of Missouri  Bill Nelson of Florida  Gary Peters of Michigan  Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire  Debbie Stabenow of Michigan  Mark Warner of Virginia  Newly sworn-in Democratic Sens. Doug Jones and Tina Smith weren't in the Senate for the last vote in December, but they're likely to support another short-term funding bill to avoid shutting down the federal government. Though he doesn't face re-election until 2020, Jones is from deeply red Alabama. Smith -- who was appointed to fill the Minnesota seat of Sen. Al Franken, who resigned -- is up for election to a full term in November.  For now, Democrats are largely waiting to see what Republicans can produce ahead of the Friday deadline, but there is a serious undercurrent itching for a fight inside the party and its activist base, aides say.

RELATED: Your guide to Congress' 'high stakes game of chicken' While Durbin seemed to signal the decision hasn't been made yet, some Democrats have made it clear they won't support a measure to continue funding the government without a guarantee there is a plan on the way to protect hundreds of thousands of young DACA recipients, as the program expires in March. The 16 Democrats who voted for the last stopgap bill to keep the government funded could be a good starting point to predict the outcome this week. After they voted for the bill, many of them -- some who are facing tough re-election campaigns this year -- were hammered by immigration advocates and the Democratic base for doing just that.  Those Democratic senators are:  Tom Carper of Delaware Chris Coons of Delaware  Joe Donnelly of Indiana  Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire  Martin Heinrich of New Mexico Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota  Tim Kaine of Virginia  Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats  Patrick Leahy of Vermont  Joe Manchin of West Virginia  Claire McCaskill of Missouri  Bill Nelson of Florida  Gary Peters of Michigan  Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire  Debbie Stabenow of Michigan  Mark Warner of Virginia  Newly sworn-in Democratic Sens. Doug Jones and Tina Smith weren't in the Senate for the last vote in December, but they're likely to support another short-term funding bill to avoid shutting down the federal government. Though he doesn't face re-election until 2020, Jones is from deeply red Alabama. Smith -- who was appointed to fill the Minnesota seat of Sen. Al Franken, who resigned -- is up for election to a full term in November.  For now, Democrats are largely waiting to see what Republicans can produce ahead of the Friday deadline, but there is a serious undercurrent itching for a fight inside the party and its activist base, aides say.

US Border Agent Rogelio \"Roger\" Martinez and his partner, Stephen \"Michael\" Garland, were found near a concrete-lined culvert in southwest Texas on November 18. Martinez died in a hospital in El Paso a few hours later. Garland also suffered injuries.   \"There were no defensive wounds\" on Martinez and his partner and \"there was no third-party blood or DNA evidence from the scene or from the agents' clothing,\" according to an internal memo, from acting US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, which was obtained by CNN. The memo also states that due to his injuries, Garland's ability to recall the events has been impaired.   \"The absence of evidence is a key factor in this case -- not due to lack of effort or determination, but because evidence which would indicate the presence of other persons or the commission of a criminal act is not present,\" the memo said.  Texas politicians -- including Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz -- described the incident as \"an attack.\" A spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represented the officers, said it was an \"ambush.\" And President Donald Trump said the injured agent had been \"brutally beaten\" as he called again for the construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico. But FBI investigators so far have found no evidence of an attack or scuffle in Martinez's death, the FBI said Wednesday, further deepening the mystery.  The investigation, to date, however \"has not conclusively determined\" how the two agents ended up at the bottom of the culvert -- a tunnel structure used for water drainage -- according to Emmerson Buie Jr., the special agent in charge of the FBI's El Paso division. No suspects have been linked to the incident. The only footprints at the scene belonged to the agents and first responders, the memo said.  The internal memo and the FBI's update on the investigation -- the agency's most detailed public account of the nighttime incident -- add another layer of uncertainty to the circumstances surrounding Martinez's death.  On Tuesday, a medical examiner in Texas said Martinez died from blunt injuries to his head, but the manner of his death is \"undetermined.\" Martinez's injuries included fractures to his skull, right jaw, upper ribs and his right collarbone, according to an autopsy report released by the El Paso County Medical Examiner's Office. Sheriff Oscar Carrillo of Culberson County, where the two officers were injured, was on scene that night.  He told the  Dallas Morning News  that investigators were looking at the possibility that the agents fell into the culvert in a nighttime accident. He also theorized that the agent's could have been sideswiped by a passing vehicle.  \"The evidence is not obvious as to what happened out there,\" Carrillo said then. The FBI has been considering several possibilities, including an accident, an attack or an altercation between the two agents, a Department of Justice official with knowledge of the investigation said. Two people previously identified as persons of interest are not connected to Martinez's death, or his partner's injuries, the FBI said Wednesday. The FBI said it conducted more than 650 interviews, including interviews with federal, state and local first responders, as well as dozens of medical personnel who treated Martinez and Garland.   Garland, who was disoriented and unsure of his location on the day of the incident, told the Border Patrol dispatcher he and Martinez were hurt, the FBI said.  \"The second Border Patrol agent also made a statement to the effect of, 'We ran into a culvert,' 'I ran into a culvert,' or 'I think I ran into a culvert,'\" the FBI said.  The dispatcher also wrote in a log: \"(He) thinks they (both agents) ran into a culvert,\" the FBI statement said. The Border Patrol dispatch told Garland to go to his vehicle and activate his emergency lights so that first responders could find them, the FBI said. First responders found Martinez first, according to the internal Customs and Border Protection memo. \"When Agent Martinez was found by first responders, it was 11:26 p.m. on a moonless night at the base of a culvert just off Interstate Highway 10.  \"The height of the culvert to the area above the opening is approximately nine feet,\" the memo said. \"The evidence also shows that the other agent fell approximately 22 feet away from where Agent Martinez fell, landing on his back and sustaining significant injuries to his back and skull,\" the memo said.  A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson declined to comment on the case.  Chris Cabrera, a spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, said the union disagreed with the findings layed out in the internal memo and the FBI's account.  \"Our view hasn't changed. Our view is he was attacked,\" he told CNN, referring to the FBI's investigation. \"It seems to me that they don't have any leads.\"  \"There's no way he fell and dropped off that culvert,\" Cabrera said. \"It's just dumb, the physics aren't there.\"  He pointed to the lack of injuries on the lower part of Martinez's body. \"If you fall from that height, you're not just going to land above the waist, your legs have to hit at some point,\" Cabrera said.  Cabrera questioned why the agents would have defensive wounds if they were ambushed. \"If you got hit from behind and didn't have a chance to defend yourself, then how would you defend yourself?\" Cabrera said. The FBI and the state of Texas have offered a $70,000 reward for information in this case. CNN's Steve Almasy, Bob Ortega, Madison Park and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.

Luis Videgaray said in a Monday interview with local media that he will give results of the analysis to President Enrique Pena Nieto in coming weeks. Videgaray said Pena Nieto will make a decision \"in the context of the relationship with the United States, in view of the very public and notorious differences we have today with the United States.\" The country's Senate passed a resolution last week saying Mexico should suspend cooperation with the U.S. on illegal immigration and drug trafficking in retaliation for Trump's move. But Videgaray said \"no decision has been taken to reduce or suspend any mechanism or cooperation.\" ___ 4:20 p.m. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is scheduled to visit southern New Mexico and speak at a conference for sheriffs in border states. Sessions will travel to Las Cruces on Wednesday and deliver remarks on immigration enforcement at an annual meeting organized by the Southwestern Border Sheriff's Coalition and the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition. Sessions' visit comes after President Donald Trump said last week he wants to send 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard members to the border. Trump also has said he wants to use the military at the border until progress is made on his proposed border wall. The Southwest Border Sheriff's Coalition is made up of 31 sheriff's departments from Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California whose counties are located within 25 miles (40 kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico border. ___ 4:15 p.m. South Carolina's governor is offering to send some of his state's National Guard troops to Texas to help fight illegal immigration and drug trafficking along the Mexican border. Gov. Henry McMaster was a supporter of President Donald Trump before Trump became the Republican front runner in the 2016 primaries. Trump called for thousands of National Guard troops along the border last week. But McMaster says his offer Monday afternoon to Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was just one state helping another, like other states have helped South Carolina after hurricanes. South Carolina Adjutant General Robert Livingston says details including how many troops the state will send, their duties and how long they will stay will have to be worked out. McMaster says he plans to make a similar offer to Arizona's Republican governor. ___ 3: 50 p.m. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez's office says more than 80 of the state's National Guard members will deploy later this week as part of President Donald Trump's effort to bolster border security. Those soldiers will be the first of an anticipated 250 from New Mexico serving in the border operation. The Republican governor in a statement reiterated her support for sending troops to the southwestern border to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking, saying the operation would ultimately make New Mexico safer. The New Mexico Guard met over the weekend with U.S. Border Patrol officials to discuss the number of troops needed and their duties. It has identified personnel to work the border operation without affecting those members who also serve in local law enforcement. Officials also say soldiers serving in the border operation will require training and background checks. ___ 3:25 p.m. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says his state will commit at least 1,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico border in response to President Donald Trump's call. The Republican Abbott told San Antonio radio station KTSA on Monday that the state will add around 300 Guard members a week. The Texas National Guard said Friday that it would send an initial deployment of 250 members. Abbott says there's no fixed date on their deployment and that \"we may be in this for the long haul.\" The governor says some Guard members may be armed if they are posted to locations where they could face danger. But Abbott said he wanted to \"downplay the notion\" that the National Guard would be \"trying to take on anybody that's coming across the border.\" ___ 3 p.m. Arizona has boosted the number of National Guard troops it will send to the Mexico border to 338 from 225 as part of President Donald Trump's plan for having the military help fight illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The Arizona National Guard said in statement that 225 troops will be deployed to the border Monday and another 113 on Tuesday. The statement came after Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced that more troops would be sent Tuesday but did not specify how many. The statement says the troops will help law enforcement agencies stem \"the flow of trafficked people, criminals, narcotics, weapons, and ammunition trafficked in the state.\" ___ 2 p.m. Arizona's governor has cited a \"surge\" of border crossings in March as one of the reasons for his decision to send members of the state's National Guard to the U.S. Mexico border to help fight illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The Republican Doug Ducey made the comments Monday after he saw off some of the 250 troops that Arizona is sending in response to President Donald Trump's plan to send up to 4,000 troops to the border. Ducey says the Arizona troops' mission is \"about providing manpower and resources to support federal, state, county, tribal and local law enforcement agencies in stopping the flow of criminals, narcotics, weapons and ammunition that is being trafficked into our state.\" Texas is also sending National Guard members to the southwestern U.S. border. New Mexico says it will. California is undecided. ___ 1:40 p.m. National guard members from Texas were shown in images taken over the weekend at the U.S.-Mexico border. But the state's National guard did not return phone and email messages Monday seeking comment on how many have arrived. The Texas National Guard had said Friday that 250 of its members would be deployed to the border within three days as part of President Donald Trump's plan to fight illegal immigration with up to 4,000 National Guard members. The images shared by the Texas Military Department which includes Guard branches showed members dressed in military fatigues shaking hands with U.S. border agents. ___ 11:40 a.m. New Mexico has not yet deployed any National Guard members to the U.S.-Mexico border in response to President Donald Trump's call to use troops to fight illegal immigration and drug trafficking. It's not clear when they will head to the border. The head of the U.S. Border Patrol sector that includes part of West Texas and all of New Mexico said Monday he met with leaders of the New Mexico National Guard to begin discussions about what will be required and their capabilities. El Paso Sector Chief Patrol Agent Aaron Hull says troops are nowhere near deploying yet. Hull says the troops could help with air support, surveillance and repairs of infrastructure along the border so that Border Patrol agents have more time to enforce immigration law. ___ 11:35 a.m. California has not decided whether to send National Guard members to the border with Mexico to help President Donald Trump's deployment of troops to fight illegal immigration and drug trafficking. That's according to Gov. Jerry Brown's spokesman Evan Westrup. He said Monday that Trump's call is still under review. Brown is a Democrat and hasn't spoken publicly about the request. California National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Keegan said last week that any request will be \"promptly reviewed to determine how best we can assist our federal partners.\" The Republican governors of Arizona and Texas have already deployed troops. New Mexico's Republican governor says her state will participate as well. ___ 11:30 a.m. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey's office says that the deployment of 225 members of the state National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border to support President Donald Trump's deployment to fight illegal immigration will be paid for by the U.S. government Ducey spoke Monday as he saw off guard members at the Papago Park Military Reservation in Phoenix. His office says guard members will provide air, reconnaissance, operational and logistical support to border patrol agents. They will also help with construction of border infrastructure to free up federal agents' time so they can concentrate on border enforcement. Arizona officials say guard personnel will be placed on initial 31-day orders and serve in the Tucson and Yuma Customs and Border Protection sectors. __ 10:30 a.m. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey says 225 members of the state's National Guard are heading to the U.S.-Mexico border to support President Donald Trump's call for troops to fight drug trafficking and illegal immigration. The Republican Ducey in a tweet Monday said more of the state's Guard members will be deployed on Tuesday. No details were immediately announced on what the Arizona troops would do at the border. Trump said last week he wants to send 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard members to the border. Texas has also said it will send National Guard members to the border. Trump has said he wants to use the military at the border until progress is made on his proposed border wall, which has mostly stalled in Congress. ___ Corrects in 1st item that Arizona troops being sent Monday and Tuesday not Tuesday and Wednesday.","articles_date":"9 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2018\/04\/09\/us\/ap-us-trump-border-the-latest.html","articles_title":"The Latest: Mexico Evaluates Immigration Cooperation With US","candidate_fk":3,"first_name":"Evan","id":273,"issue":5,"last_name":"Jenkins","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"The Latest on three police officers being shot while responding to a domestic related incident.

Prince William County Commonwealth Attorney Paul Ebert says he has authorized a capital murder charge, along with other counts, against the suspect, who has not been identified. Police say Police Officer Ashley Guindon, who was sworn in Friday and started her first shift Saturday, died from her injuries after responding to a verbal argument Saturday. The condition of the two other officers shot is not known. Virginia law allows for the death penalty for the murder of a police officer. Ebert said the suspect will make his first court appearance on Monday.

At the core of the debate was the realization dawning on both sides that even after weeks of lead-up, no proposal seemed to have the key number of 60 senators supporting it -- the threshold to advance that proposal in the Senate, if it is ever able to kick off.  In the Capitol on Tuesday, no one could say exactly how things were going to go, with everyone banking on a last-minute deal being struck, as negotiations continued furiously in the background. On Tuesday evening, McConnell ended the drama for the day, teeing up a final vote on whether to even open debate on the bill for Wednesday. \"It's amazing how magically, suddenly things appear,\" Florida Democrat Bill Nelson said when asked about criticism that Democrats and bipartisan negotiations have yet to produce a deal with 60 votes.  Senate No. 2 Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois said the holdup was \"reaching agreements.\" \"You're supposed to be confused. You are on the outside,\" he told reporters Tuesday afternoon. \"I'm on the inside and I'm confused.\" Finger pointing The process got off to an inauspicious start on Monday night, when the Senate cleared a procedural hurdle to move toward opening debate on the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, as had been promised for weeks by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. But just outside the Senate chamber, Republican leadership  told reporters that the debate would get only a week  of floor time -- a move to pressure Democrats to produce their legislative proposals.  Democrats and some Republicans had anticipated possible weeks of debate -- and little legislation has been finalized and introduced on either side yet that would deal with DACA, a program that protected young undocumented immigrants from deportation that President Donald Trump is ending, and any other provisions on immigration.  Instead of then moving straight into a vote to open debate, the Senate spent Tuesday arguing about next steps, with Democrats accusing Republicans of tampering with the procedure and Republicans accusing Democrats of dilatory tactics because they had nothing to offer.  The finger pointing spilled onto the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon, when McConnell moved to consider an amendment that would have dealt with sanctuary cities -- a favorite target of Republicans.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York objected, asking instead that the body move to consider  a bill largely resembling the White House proposal  -- a pathway to citizenship for DACA eligible immigrants, a hefty border security request, substantially curtailing family-based migration and ending the diversity visa lottery -- in conjunction with  a proposal from Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware  that would pair DACA with a comprehensive review of border security.   Schumer noted that neither would likely succeed -- but would at least kick things off. And he noted that only one had been drafted and officially introduced -- the McCain-Coons bill -- saying the Senate could vote as soon as the Republican proposal was written. Some Democrats also privately suspected Republicans were hesitating to have the White House proposal go first, only to be defeated immediately, and were seeking to delay.  \"That (pairing) will tell us, sort of, the bounds,\" Schumer told reporters at a news conference later. \"I don't think either of them will get large bipartisan support. But it will give us an idea of the parameters and can set us moving. ... Now, if these proposals fail, the body will continue to work its bipartisan will for a bill that can pass.\" Republicans, meanwhile, mocked Democrats for not being ready in time and trying to avoid votes that could be difficult for vulnerable members of their party.  \"It's an open process, right?\" said GOP leadership member Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. \"So if our leader wants to call that (sanctuary cities) amendment up, I mean, eventually we'll get to (the White House framework), but there are others we want to process as well, but I'm not sure why you would block even moving to the initial consideration of amendments, which is what the Democrats are currently doing. That makes no sense if you're the ones who have been advocating now for literally weeks that we need to get on an immigration bill.\" Calm exterior but negotiations continue  Democrats did not telegraph any concern about the timeline, even as the day slipped away. They called a Thursday deadline \"arbitrary,\" in the words of Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, and held their fire on GOP leadership.  \"Negotiations continue,\" Durbin said. \"The timetable is dependent on the rules of the Senate and unanimous consent requests. ... I hope we can finish it this week.\" \"The sooner, the better,\" Schumer said at a news conference after party lunches. \"But right now, our focus is getting to 60. That's going to take a lot of push and pull. A lot of compromise.\" The calmness, though, belied furious negotiations behind the scenes.  As Democrats were locked away in their closed-door lunch, intense conversations among key players spilled outside into the view of reporters.  At the top of the caucus meeting, Durbin and Schumer huddled for a few minutes with two aides on the steps just outside, where press is not allowed, an unusual occurrence. Not long after going inside, Schumer came out again and huddled with just the staff, which included top Durbin counsel Joseph Zogby, a regular attendee at immigration meetings. After Schumer returned to his meeting, the staff continued to meet just outside.  Democrats were tight-lipped coming out of the meeting -- Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland confirmed they were going over proposals on immigration and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said they were \"making progress,\" but all refused to go into further detail. A group of bipartisan senators also continued to work furiously behind-the-scenes, exchanging drafts of possibilities and working to find a fit that would get 60 votes.  Coons, who is part of the group as well as being involved in the McCain-Coons bill, was working the Senate gym Tuesday morning, talking to members about the negotiations, according to a source familiar. The bipartisan gathering place had a fair number of Republicans and Democrats in it as Coons spoke to those around the room, the source said.   Of course, in the Senate, things could come together very quickly -- or not at all. In the meantime, everyone was waiting to see what happened next.  Asked if he felt that he was getting what was promised, Durbin was characteristically upbeat.  \"It does,\" Durbin said. \"This is the Senate.\" CNN's Ted Barrett and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.

Renewed fervor improves Democratic prospects in 2018 House and Senate elections. At the same time, in a development reminiscent of the Tea Party Republican insurgency of 2010, moderate and centrist Democratic incumbents face primary challengers from the Sanders left. In some cases, these challengers raise the threat of bitterly contested midterm primaries that could leave House and Senate nominees weakened for the general election. Two moderate Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, both face primary challenges from the insurgent progressive wing of their party, as do a growing number of Democratic House incumbents. Center versus left disputes within Democratic ranks have surfaced on several fronts, even as Democrats of all stripes have come to recognize the devastating costs of the Trump-era Republican attack on the nature of truth and the parallel rise of \u201calternative facts.\u201d The Democratic National Committee, charged with a crucial organizational role in the coming presidential election, continues to struggle to regain standing with Sanders supporters after a series of conflicts in 2016 and 2017 over such matters as control of valuable donor lists and demands for a more progressive agenda. Intra-Democratic conflict resurfaced this week with the release of anti-Sanders passages from Hillary Clinton\u2019s new book, \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d Clinton wrote that \u201cattacks\u201d Sanders made during the primary season caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump\u2019s \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d campaign. I don\u2019t know if that bothered Bernie or not. Clinton added that Sanders \u201cdidn\u2019t get into the race to make sure a Democrat won the White House, he got in to disrupt the Democratic Party.\u201d In a statement on Wednesday, Sanders countered: \u201cMy response is that right now it\u2019s appropriate to look forward and not backward.\u201d EDITORS\u2019 PICKS See What\u2019s Left of Benghazi, 6 Years After the Consulate Siege \u2018There Were Really No Other Women at All\u2019 The Baby-Formula Crime Ring There is good evidence that defections by Sanders\u2019 Democratic primary voters to Trump on Nov. 8 played a decisive role in Trump\u2019s victory. Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, calculated that Sanders-to-Trump voters were key to Trump\u2019s victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The accompanying chart, which is based on the 2016 survey conducted by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, shows how crucial these voters were. The internal battle over how to maximize the political strength of the party reflects the fact that it is made up of a coalition of multiple, sometimes overlapping, factions with an intense desire to win, but in constant competition with one another. These factions include economic populists, led by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, along with Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown; increasingly influential women, including Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Warren; an equally influential group of African-American politicians, including Cory Booker, Deval Patrick and Harris; Hispanics determined to gain power, including Juli\u00e1n and Joaqu\u00edn Castro and Xavier Becerra; and a still strong but often challenged white male Democratic establishment that includes Joe Biden and Terry McAuliffe. Many of the current conflicts enlarge upon the ideological divisions that dominated the 2016 presidential primaries, with Hillary Clinton representing the centrist wing and Bernie Sanders the progressive wing. The debate going into the next election cycle raises the question of whether the Democratic Party will be most successful with continued \u2014 or enlarged \u2014 support from a segment of the white working class: 34 percent of non-college white women and 23 percent of non-college white men voted for Clinton in 2016. Can these numbers be maintained or improved or should Democrats look elsewhere \u2014 for more votes from minorities and deeper support from women, along with continued improvement among upscale whites \u2014 to piece together victory in 2018 or 2020? There is an argument to be made that the party has in fact already moved sharply in a leftward direction. In a phone interview, Mark Longabaugh, a senior strategist in the Sanders campaign, cited data from the Pew Research Center showing that the percentage of Democrats describing themselves as \u201cliberal\u201d grew from 27 to 48 percent from 2000 to 2017, while self-identified Democratic moderates fell from 45 to 36 percent. Conservative Democrats dropped from 23 to 16 percent. The Times needs your voice. We welcome your on-topic commentary, criticism and expertise. \u201cThe party is still this wrestling about its identity,\u201d Longabaugh said. He suggested that Democrats are stalled by what he described as \u201ca sort of rubbernecking, watching this 15-car pileup in the Republican Party\u201d on the other side of the road while \u201cwe are stuck in traffic, not moving forward.\u201d Despite the continuing ideological confusion, there are a number of positive signs for the Democratic Party. In a reflection of the determination among Democratic voters to take control of the House out of the hands of Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party, individuals\u2019 contributions to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have risen from $32.4 million in the first seven months of 2013 to $50.2 million in the first seven months of this year. Not only have contributions from individuals (as opposed to political action committees) to the D.C.C.C. surged, but the amount raised from individuals is triple the $15.8 million raised by the National Republican Congressional Committee through the first seven months of this year. The same cannot be said about the Democratic National Committee \u2014 battered by the anger of Sanders supporters. The D.N.C. has seen a much smaller increase in individual contributions over the same period, from $30.7 million to $33.0 million. The surge in anti-Trump activity across the country makes the limited D.N.C. fund-raising success surprising and speaks to the gravity of the committee\u2019s problems. Signs of the stress the Democratic Party is under are evident in the degree of institutional fracturing. Sanders has created what amounts to his own party organization, Our Revolution, which endorses candidates \u2014 a signal to voters of Sanders\u2019 backing and of its separation from the Democratic Party. In a revealing statement of purpose the organization declares that Our Revolution will empower the next generation of progressive leaders by inspiring and recruiting progressive candidates to run for offices across the entire spectrum of government. For candidates \u201cinspired by the \u2018political revolution,\u2019 \u201d Our Revolution promises to provide the unparalleled digital tools, organizing knowledge and grassroots support successfully utilized throughout Senator Sanders\u2019 campaign. Wariness, if not downright hostility, dominates relations between Our Revolution and the Democratic Party. The tensions between the two are rooted in the disclosure during the 2016 primaries that leaders of the D.N.C. favored Clinton while privately disparaging Sanders\u2019 bid. In February of this year, Thomas Perez, the candidate favored by the Democratic establishment, beat Keith Ellison \u2014 who was endorsed by Sanders and who has a strong following among the party\u2019s progressive wing, as well as among its African-American constituency \u2014 in the election to become chairman of the D.N.C. Further compounding the conflict, Sanders has declined to share his donor lists with the Democratic Party. \u201cWe are working hard to regain trust,\u201d Jess O\u2019Connell, the new executive director of the D.N.C., said in a phone interview, although there appears to have been no letup in the tension between the party and the Sanders camp. In June, the Nation conducted an interview with Nina Turner, a former Ohio State Senator, who is now president of Our Revolution. In April 2016, Turner had famously objected that \u201cbrand loyalty\u201d was causing African-American voters to support Hillary Clinton. The Nation asked: How will Our Revolution relate to the DNC, the DCCC, the DSCC, that kind of establishment that so many activists and politicians, including you, have frequently criticized? Her reply: I don\u2019t think it is our job nor our obligation to fit in. It\u2019s their job to fit in with us. Then: And what about the Democratic Party at large. Do you see Our Revolution working to bring some unity to factions in the party? Turner\u2019s reply: No, not really. I want people to be unified. I would say that the board of directors wants that too, but we\u2019re here for a very specific purpose, and that is to help the everyday Americans in this country who feel left behind. Two months later, in August, relations remained hostile. Buzzfeed reported that in an interview, Turner described the D.N.C. as \u201cdictatorial,\u201d \u201carrogant,\u201d \u201cpompous,\u201d \u201csuperficial,\u201d \u201ctone-deaf,\u201d \u201ctone-dead,\u201d \u201cout of line,\u201d \u201cinsulting\u201d and \u201cabsolutely insulting.\u201d Turner declined my requests for an interview. But in a sense her views on the Democratic establishment are moderate compared to those voiced by groups and individuals further to the left. Two organizations that have joined forces, Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress, are run by veterans of the Sanders presidential campaign including Zack Exley and Saikat Chakrabarti. Their goal: replacing \u201cevery establishment politician in Congress in 2018,\u201d although so far they have endorsed 10 House candidates and one Senate candidate. The two groups, which together reported receipts of $1.2 million this year, have set their sights on Manchin, in West Virginia. Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats have endorsed Manchin\u2019s primary challenger, Paula Jean Swearengin, who describes herself as \u201ca coal miner\u2019s daughter, granddaughter, niece and stepdaughter.\u201d In the view of Justice Democrats: The Democratic Party is broken, and the corporate wing of the party is responsible. By aligning with Wall Street over working men and women, the Democratic Party has allowed Republicans to take over most state legislatures, most governorships, Congress, and the presidency. CREDO Mobile, which does not endorse candidates but instead channels support to liberal groups like Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, goes a step further. It is willing to sacrifice centrist Democrats for the sake of ideological consistency. Murshed Zaheed, CREDO\u2019s political director, told The Associated Press in March, I\u2019d rather have 44 or 45 awesome Democrats who are lock step together than 44 or 45 really awesome Democrats and three to four weak-kneed individuals who are going to dilute the party. I spoke with Zaheed by phone. He stood by his comment to The A.P. He described himself as a \u201cdie-hard Democrat\u201d but he wants \u201ca Democratic Party that is going to stand up to corporations and big business.\u201d Insofar as these intraparty power struggles are fought out in primary elections, the more passionately committed the faction, the greater its advantage. Ideologically committed voters turn out in higher percentages in primaries than less ideological moderates. The Pew data cited above reveal that the Democratic Party is at a tipping point, with the percentage of self-identified liberals in the Democratic electorate currently at 48 percent and rising. This suggests that in the struggle for power among the competing racial, ethnic and gender constituencies, the Sanders-Warren populist wing could emerge as the dominant force in the selection of a 2020 Democratic nominee. In theory, the selection of a nominee loyal to the left-liberal wing in the 2020 general election would test the political viability of a Democratic Party that explicitly challenges corporate power \u2014 and indeed the capitalist system itself. Victory would legitimate the arguments of the Sanders-Warren wing. In practice, such a victory would leave the party in ideological limbo. Could Sanders or one of his revolutionary offspring actually govern? Could such a politician win against a candidate other than Donald Trump? Can the leftward movement of Democratic voters find an echo among independent and moderate voters in the general electorate? These fundamental questions are very hard to answer. Trump or no Trump, they will continue to plague the Democratic Party, not just for the next two election cycles, but on into the foreseeable future.","articles_date":"7 9 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/09\/07\/opinion\/clinton-sanders-democratic-party.html","articles_title":"The Struggle Between Clinton and Sanders Is Not Over","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":276,"issue":8,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Bakari Sellers is a former Democratic member of the South Carolina House of Representatives and a CNN commentator. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.  (CNN) Who are we? Who is our target demographic? And what do stand for?  These are just a few of the questions Democrats have been attempting to answer since November 8, 2016.  And still, after months of reflection, the Democratic Party has made only modest progress in this enduring search for self. However, if we are serious about finding answers to these questions, we must start with our narrative. There is an ill-fated belief trending among party leaders that one overarching message will encompass the infinite number of unique experiences across the country. But the idea that we can promote one message to appeal to the white working class, inspire people of color to vote and urge the growing progressive wing to mobilize is simply baffling. Politics is about people. And while it is critical for Democrats to address the economic anxieties of all Americans, we must speak to people in a way that truly resonates and hits home. To do this effectively, Democrats cannot simply shift to an exclusively economic message, abandoning identity politics and social justice causes. In other words, Democrats must create a multipronged platform that speaks to the financial fears of white voters and the social fears of people of color. And if Democrats need an example of how to effectively speak to all the fears of voters, they need look no further than the gubernatorial Democratic primary taking place in the battleground state of Virginia. A  CNN article  referred to this June 13 election as \"Virginia Democrats face first battle in war for party's soul.\" And, indeed, many have turned this race between Rep. Tom Perriello and Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam into the rematch of Bernie Sanders versus Hillary Clinton. There is the false narrative emerging that Perriello, who has scored the endorsements of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, is viewed as representing the progressive wing of the party. In contrast, Northam, a former two-term senator, who has the endorsements of many traditional Virginia Democrats, including Sen. Tim Kaine and Gov. Terry McAuliffe, is viewed to represent the more establishment wing of the party.     The Democratic Party cannot and should not be summarized as establishment versus progressives. And, more importantly, it cannot win with that kind of rivalry. For example, there are many Clinton supporters who appreciate both candidates for their progressive stances, but are still supporting Perriello because they are drawn to his authentic social justice message, one that's rooted in understanding the plight of voters of color coupled with tangible policy goals.  This message of social justice is even more expansive and thorough than that of his endorsers  Sanders and Warren.  Even during  Sanders' recent speech at the People's Summit, he was rightly heavy on economic populism and disappointingly scant of civil rights and social justice.  While many continue to pay lip service to the faithful party base, Perriello has created a campaign that moves beyond the rhetoric and is truly responsive to communities of color that are still hurting.  Simply put, Perriello gets it. He understands the blueprint for crafting a message that speaks to disaffected white voters, while also giving voters of color a full-throated reason to come out and vote for his campaign.  Democrats clearly made mistakes in 2016; we cannot win by simply ignoring rural America. The frustration from white working-class voters is palpable and just. Our government has failed them, too. However, African-American voters, especially in the South, understand that they do not have the luxury to choose between economic justice and racial justice.  These issues must be coupled together. One without the other is useless. Perriello has not only called for a \" Commission on Racial Healing and Transformation ,\" but he's gone even further: \"We have to call out racism structural and overt where we see it, and we have to continue to address the issues of deep racial inequality we have here in Virginia, where the median net worth of an African-American family remains 1\/11th that of a median white family in Virginia.  We must deal with the structural barriers and have these conversations even when they're uncomfortable.\"    This sentiment does not just apply to Virginia, though. It is a microcosm of the plight of black voters across the country. The days of just making Sunday morning church visits and meeting with the so-called leaders of the black community are over. Candidates are now also compelled to give policy-rich objectives and embrace identity politics.  Traditional methods take black voters for granted, and the result is depressed turnout.  In 2012, the Census Bureau said black voters for the first time voted at a  higher share  than non-Hispanic whites. Contrast that to 2016 black voter turnout, when turnout was down across the board, including swing states like Virginia. If black turnout in these states reached 2012 levels, the result might have been President Clinton and not President Trump. Self-reflection and growth is hard, and it takes time. However, for the sake of the party we must all evolve. And as we move forward, I strongly encourage party leaders to take some notes from Perriello's playbook.

He is the founder of  Big Bend Strategies  and publishes regularly at  Texas to the World . The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.   (CNN) In the Texas spring, while much of the country still shivers, bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush begin to color the roadsides and paint pastures that stretch along fence rows. Riding a motorcycle along those pastel byways offers memories that endlessly abide for me. Coming up from the border to visit friends in San Antonio and Austin, I often shorten the ride by running through Sutherland Springs.  There was not much there to notice on my first trip other than an ocean of wildflowers, which proliferated almost to the horizon of that South Texas plain. The only  two buildings left standing  from the old town settlement had trees growing where once there were floors. The community's glory days at the turn of the 20th century were a story of people riding the train out from San Antonio to spend weekends taking the curative waters of the sulphur springs along Cibolo Creek, and stay in the  52-room Hotel Sutherland . The springs had given the town a reputation as the \" Saratoga of the South .\"  Sutherland Springs is as quiet and common as the hundreds of other Texas towns I have visited. One light blinks over the intersection of the main street and a farm-to-market road. Business is comprised of a chain general store and a gas station. There is a post office and a white church with a low steeple, which still rises above the prickly pear cactus, live oak and hackberry trees growing on the edge of the Texas Brush Country. The town of  about 350  people is less than 30 miles east of San Antonio, but in many ways, seems much more remote. Few places could feel more secure and safe.  But that has all ended.  When a  black-clad gunman  walked into the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs and opened fire on the congregation, he also killed the last quaint notion Americans have about guns and mass shootings. We can no longer believe there are places where this just couldn't happen. Even if you trust in the \"good guy with a gun\" mythology of being protected, consider this: Nobody expects the faithful in a tiny town to get up on a Sunday morning and strap on a pistol before they head to their house of worship for prayer.  Finally, we have to accept that no place is safe, and everyone is now a suspect.  If Sutherland Springs can become a national tragedy, the coffee shop or roadhouse where you planned to enjoy lunch on your next trip west is of equal risk. You must sit facing the door and size up everyone who enters and wonder if they might be a tortured soul with a weapon. Shopping in your small-town grocery store, you will feel compelled to look around while making a decision on breakfast cereals. Does the man lingering at the end of the aisle look like he has something under his coat? This is the culture of fear we have decided is acceptable.   We elect politicians like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a sweetheart of the gun lobby, who once tweeted that he was \"embarrassed\" that his state was No. 2 in gun purchases, according to NRA statistics in 2015, even though more than a million guns had been bought by October of that year. Though his figures  were incorrect , Abbott still urged his constituents to pick up the buying pace. And one of them did. Less than six months after Abbott's tweet, a man court-martialed for abusing his wife and child purchased an AR-556 rifle at a San Antonio store, according to law enforcement. Officials also said he had sent threatening messages to his mother-in-law, who attended First Baptist on Sunday; multiple friends  told CNN his grandmother-in-law was killed . According to Abbott, citing the director of Texas' Department of Public Safety, the shooter  tried to get a license  to carry but was denied, but he was still able to make his purchase.  President Trump has argued that what happened here in Texas is the result of a \" mental health problem ,\" and is not about US gun laws. His actions make clear the killer was mentally troubled, but he also lived in a country where the laws and the technology systems allowed him to access a gun, and that's not likely to change when one of his US senators, Republican Ted Cruz,  took $360,727  from the National Rifle Association while running for president. The Cruz solution to gun violence, based on his response to this tragedy, is to  offer prayers , which is what the 26 people in Sutherland Springs were doing when they died.  Prayer has not fixed this, nor will it. Our mass shootings have become so frequent in America we now break them out into categories. One headline about Sutherland Springs called it the deadliest church shooting in US history. We, of course, also have categories for malls, schools, movie theaters, parks, restaurants, and various public gathering places. The Texas attorney general has suggested the solution is for churches to provide security and arm congregants. Praise the lord and pass the ammo? \"This is going to happen again,\" he has  assured us .  I will ride again through  Sutherland Springs , but I won't be admiring wildflowers or  thinking about  Dr. John Sutherland, who the town was named for and whose 18-year-old nephew died at the Alamo, or the time Gen. Robert E. Lee spent in a local guesthouse.  I'll instead look off at the little white church house by the side of the road and confront the memory of the day that some of the last, faint traces of American innocence were killed. And I'll probably also be looking over my shoulder. An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the gunman's mother-in-law as a victim of the shooting; multiple friends told CNN the grandmother-in-law was killed.

That's essentially the scenario as President Donald Trump, who built his political career fanning the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama wasn't born in the US and has made sport of creating new ones,  took the opportunity  to green-light part of a trove of previously classified documents related to the JFK assassination -- while citing national security to keep many of them secret, at least on a temporary basis. Trump has relished releasing the documents, teasing it on Twitter and in comments to reporters, although the opportunity came to him courtesy of a law enacted 25 years ago in 1992, after the release of fellow conspiracy theorist Oliver Stone's movie about the assassination. His surprise decision late Thursday to accede to mysterious government agency requests and keep a few of the documents secret will only add fuel to the fire. Trump even added to Kennedy conspiracy canon when, during the 2016 campaign, he pushed the scurrilous idea that rival Ted Cruz's father had been photographed with Lee Harvey Oswald. There's no evidence to support that report, which came from the Trump-friendly National Enquirer. In case you needed that to be stated. The Kennedy assassination theories are legion --  read about some of them here  -- and it is, in many ways, the greatest conspiracy theory in US history that Oswald had help. Every responsible examination has come to the conclusion he did not. The release of documents isn't expected to shatter those conclusions. Nor is it likely to convince Americans.  A Gallup survey in 2013  found that 61% didn't think Oswald acted alone. If the many reviews and millions of pages of already public documents haven't put the conspiracy theories to rest, neither will this. It's not clear what Trump's thoughts are on the Kennedy assassination. It bears mentioning that Trump has started, pushed and profited from a number of non-Kennedy conspiracy theories during his career.  Here are some of those, just as a refresher and without re-litigating any of them, in no particular order: 1. Barack Obama was not born in the US Trump was, in many ways, Birther No. 1. Long after it was shown Obama was born in Hawaii, Trump wouldn't admit that was true. He finally did, but turned the spectacle of his comeuppance,  in September 2016 , into a marketing event for his new hotel and a jibe at Hillary Clinton. None of the other theories Trump has fanned have ended with anything close to this type of finality. But it bears mentioning that if conspiracy theories were to judged on their efficiency, this is Trump's  piece de resistance .  Back in September of 2015 , 20% of Americans doubted Obama was born in the US, 29% of Americans (and 43% of Republicans) thought he was a Muslim.  2. 3 million illegal votes cost him a popular victory This is not true and there's no evidence to support it, but  Trump has repeated the claim over and over . He even, as President, appointed a commission to investigate the idea. Their work is ongoing, apparently, but we haven't seen anything to suggest a widespread voter fraud conspiracy. 3. Barack Obama bugged him  Trump started this one on Twitter as the investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia heated up. He alleged that the former President had wire-tapped Trump Tower in New York. While some of his campaign staffers may have been under FBI surveillance,  there's no evidence  that Obama was personally involved or that Trump himself was wiretapped. 4. Ted Cruz's father was in cahoots with Lee Harvey Oswald See above. Trump repeated this after Cruz declined to endorse him during the Republican National Convention. The two seem to have mended fences, somewhat, but the effects of Trump's claim linger. Cruz was asked about the release of the JFK documents this week.  \"They should be public,\" he told TMZ . 5. The deep state is out to get him This is a broader and more sinister idea, arguably, than any of the others. And it has pervaded his administration, pushed most by his former chief strategist Steve Bannon. The idea is that there is an ingrained secret subculture of government apparatchiks bent on the destruction of his presidency.  Related: What is a deep state? 6. The media is full of fake news Since he won the election, Trump has been on an all-out campaign to delegitimize the news media as \"fake\" and all trying to make him look bad. He's turned it into a hashtag, a joke, an accusation, an applause line and more.  There are more, for sure. His claims about Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9\/11. You could put some of his claims about Hillary Clinton into the conspiracy theory bin, as well.

Joseph Kennedy III, a potential rising star in the Democratic Party, will get a huge platform and a plum political assignment when he delivers  the response to President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address  on Tuesday. It's a role that brings with it high expectations and, for a few years, seemed to leave young politicians with a bit of bad luck. Long dubbed the \"curse\" of the State of the Union response,  lawmakers tasked with following the grandiose speech from the President  have struggled to counter with the same gravitas, and some seem to have jinxed their own political aspirations down the road. Four of them ran for national office just in the 2016 election but came up empty. However, in more immediate memory, Cathy McMorris Rodgers (2014) still holds her leadership slot in the House, Joni Ernst (2015) holds her Senate seat and Nikki Haley (2016) now serves as US ambassador to the United Nations. Paul Ryan (2011) followed his response with failure on the national stage but has since rebounded nicely. Two responders \u2014 Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton \u2014 did eventually give their own State of the Union addresses as president. But here are 10 responders from recent history who hit at least some bad luck after their major addresses. 1. Sen. Marco Rubio (2013) Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida gave the Republican rebuttal to the State of the Union address in 2013 after his election to the Senate in 2010. He launched a bid for the White House in 2016, withdrawing from the campaign after losing his home state of Florida that March to sitting President Donald Trump. Consolation prize: After dropping out of the White House race he ran for and got to keep his Senate seat. 2. Rep. Paul Ryan (2011) A then-rising star in GOP politics, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, then the new chair of the House budget panel, was selected to give the State of the Union response in 2011. The next year, when presidential nominee Mitt Romney chose him as his running mate, Ryan lost the vice presidential race. He has rebounded from his defeat, now serving as speaker of the House. 3. Gov. Bob McDonnell (2010) The Virginia governor gave the GOP State of the Union response just days after being sworn into office in Virginia, but McDonnell's post-office life has been plagued by scandal. He and his wife were indicted on corruption charges in 2014 and convicted later that year of receiving, gifts, money and loans from a company in exchange for political favors. The Supreme Court  vacated his conviction  in 2016. 4. Gov. Bobby Jindal (2009) Gov. Bobby Jindal, a young Indian-American governor in Louisiana, was also seen as a rising star in the Republican Party. But his State of the Union rebuttal was criticized by those on both sides of the aisle. He ran for president in 2016, ending his campaign before reaching the Iowa caucuses after frequently hitting 1% or lower in primary polling. 5. Sen. Jim Webb (2007) Democratic Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia gave the 2007 response to the State of the Union address after his election in 2006. But after that, he ruled himself out of Obama's vice presidential speculation in 2008, didn't run for re-election in 2012 and flopped in a bid for the White House in 2016 after memorably talking onstage at a presidential debate about killing an enemy soldier. 6. Gov. Tim Kaine (2006) Tim Kaine gave the State of the Union rebuttal in 2006 as the governor of Virginia. He had political success immediately afterward: He become chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2009 and was elected to the US Senate in 2012. But he failed to capture the vice presidency in 2016 as Hillary Clinton's running mate. His name will forever be on the losing side of one of the nation's greatest political upsets. 7. Sen. Tom Daschle (2004) Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota gave the State of the Union response in 2004. He lost his Senate seat that November, and then had to  withdraw from his nomination  to be health and human services secretary in 2009 after mistakes on his tax returns. His counterpart in the address, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, had better luck, going on to become the first female speaker of the House. But Pelosi's Democrats lost the majority in 2010 and she's been  trying to get it back ever since. 8. Rep. Dick Gephardt (2002) Then-House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt gave the State of the Union rebuttal in 2001 and 2002. He ran for president in 2004 but dropped out after the Iowa caucuses. There was speculation about his vice presidential candidacy in 2004 and 2008. 9. Sen. Bob Dole (1994) Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas gave the GOP response to the State of the Union in 1994 and again in 1996, when he was nominated to run against President Bill Clinton's re-election campaign. It didn't go so well -- like his bids for vice president in 1976 and president in 1980 and 1988. 10. Rep. Tom Foley (1992) Former House Speaker Tom Foley gave the Democratic State of the Union response in 1990 and 1992 under President George H.W. Bush -- until he became  only the third speaker of the House  to lose his re-election bid to his seat, in 1994.

The onset of a new era in American politics.   And it was -- just not in the way the candidates, their staffers, voters and the reporters who covered them all had expected. November 8, 2016, means different things to different people. For supporters of President Donald Trump, the date represents a kind of deliverance, their faith in the billionaire businessman rewarded after months of polls suggesting his campaign was doomed. Hillary Clinton's coalition, along with a vocal band of \"Never Trump\" Republicans, regard it quite differently. Many entered the Javits Center in New York City that evening for a party. For history. They left shattered. This is the story of Election Day in 2016, from the last gasp campaign events, to the heady (for Clinton) early hours and glorious (for Trump) evening. The \"day\" -- all 36 hours of it -- ended at the White House, where President Barack Obama acknowledged the result.  This is how it happened, as viewed through social media, and in the memories of CNN reporters who witnessed it live. LAST GASP CNN producer Betsy Klein: \"I was the pool reporter for the networks the day before election day, and Tim Kaine had a midnight rally at his hometown in Richmond after a full day of campaign events (Raleigh, Charlotte, and Wilmington, NC, then to Fairfax, VA). My job during that rally was to ride up in a lift about 100 feet in the air, get some nice overhead footage, then come back down. But they realized the lift was too loud to move during the rally and didn't tell me so I got stuck up there for the entire event.\" CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jeff Zeleny: \"More than three hours before sunrise, Hillary Clinton's blue and white campaign plane landed in White Plains, New York, after one final rally. The Clinton staff wasn't just counting their chickens before a single vote was tabulated, they were popping the champagne. Jon Bon Jovi was aboard, holding court with Bill and Hillary Clinton. A couple dozen Clinton friends and top aides were too. As reporters watched from the back of the plane, their words were out of earshot, but their celebration was clear as they raised their glasses to what they over-confidently thought was a job well done. Clinton thought she was going to win. Her aides told her so. It would be their only champagne toast on Election Day.\" MORNING BLAST CNN senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta \"I'll never forget the senior Trump official who told me early on Election Day that it would take a 'miracle' for Trump to win. This source was convinced Trump was going to lose in large part because of the Access Hollywood scandal.\" CNN Producer Dan Merica \"It has been a long night but Hillary Clinton felt like she was going to win. After a Lady Gaga concert in North Carolina at 12:30 p.m. ET and a tarmac rally with some of her longtime supporters in New York at 3 a.m. ET, Clinton's last frenetic day of campaigning was over. There was optimism on the plane, even from the woman up front who had long been careful about appearing confident. I slept for a couple hours after getting home from the airport and woke up at 6 a.m. to go vote with Clinton. I was pool on Election Day and we were at a local school in Chappaqua, New York waiting for the first woman from a major political party to put a check mark next to her name on a presidential ballot. Clinton, despite the lack of sleep, arrived all smiles wearing a gold pant suit. Bill Clinton was in tow sporting a blue suit and light blue tie. The voting was inconsequential, even if it was historic. It was my interaction with both Clintons that remained with me long past her loss. As women lined up outside thanked Clinton for her campaign, I could see she was moved. What does this all mean, I asked. 'It's the most humbling feeling,' Clinton said, reflecting on the history of her campaign for one of the first times. 'I know how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the outcome of this election. ... And I will do the very best I can if I am fortunate enough to win.' After years of covering Clinton, it was one of the first times I remember thinking she feels like she is going to win -- and make history.\"  HALFTIME CNN producer Betsy Klein: \"Tim Kaine posed for a photo aboard his campaign plane with family and staff in Richmond before boarding for New York. Festive mood, lot of smiles. On the flight, Kaine gave each member of his staff a signed harmonica, a bottle of Virginia wine, and a personal note.\" CNN Senior Washington Correspondent Brianna Keilar: The major upset was still hours off, but here Keilar recalls another surprise -- and, as it turned out, a preview of what would follow eight months later. \"It was March 8 and I was covering Bernie Sanders in Florida. He was about as far away from Michigan as he could be while his campaign waited to be slaughtered there by Hillary Clinton. Polls had him down by more than 21 points on average. He held an early event in Miami, looking forward to Florida's contest, and the auditorium was totally empty long before polls closed so Sanders could give a speech before losing the night, common practice for a campaign expecting a primary loss. Crews from other networks left the venue. No point staying, the news wasn't with Sanders.  As results started coming he was surprisingly close to Clinton, but pundits and even Bernie aides reasoned that as more votes were tallied she would pull away. With Sanders leading early a source close to his campaign told CNN it was nice to be in the running at least for a little while, even though they still expected to lose. The night continued on and soon it was clear that this was going to be a squeaker.  And then Sanders won. This was what his rally site looked like when the race was called. Empty except for our lonely news crew. The polls had been off by over 20 points in what would be a key state in Clinton's general election firewall that failed to hold.\" FIRST RESULTS IN \u2014 7 p.m. ET CNN Exec. Director of Political Programming Mark Preston \"By 8:30 p.m. ET, the safe prediction that Clinton would win started to fade as Trump's strength in Florida, North Carolina and the Midwest showed he was very much in this race. A senior Trump strategist started calling me around 9:45 p.m. ET to tell me that Trump would win Pennsylvania -- a state the Republican Party presidential nominee had not carried since George H.W. Bush's victory in 1988.  The Trump strategist turned out to be right, and we were never so wrong. There has been a lot of self-reflection about how we 'missed' this election, how we 'missed' the mood of the country. That is healthy. But there were 'sure signs' that led people to believe that Trump would never win, could never win.\" CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash The night still had some twists. But the result was a long time coming.   \"For me, the Republican debates were defining, and telling. They showed that the power of the Trump message and personality far surpassed requirements voters had in the past for candidates to offer substantive plans, and be familiar with fundamentals. I remember asking Donald Trump in one of the debates about his health care plan. He mentioned being able to buy insurance across state lines, but when pressed by his opponents, and by me, to put more meat on the bone, he didn't. And it turned out that voters didn't much care. Another example was when my co-questioner Hugh Hewitt asked Trump about the nuclear triad. The billionaire businessman clearly had no idea what he was talking about. For most candidates that would have meant lights out for their campaign, but not Trump.  GOP voters held him to a different standard. It was a clear stark illustration of how the candidates who knew more about such issues, like Marco Rubio, seemed to suffer for their insights.\" CNN Producer Cassie Spodak \"I remember around 10 p.m. ET the huge monitors in the (Clinton) press filing room campaign turned off the cable news feeds of election results and we were forced to watch different promotional videos from the campaign. That felt like a turning point.\"  CNN Producer Betsy Klein  \"One of the more jarring moments of the evening -- around this time it has become clear in the Javits Center that things are not going Clinton's way. So what do they do? They play a long celebrity video of Clinton's signature 'Fight Song.'\" CNN Lead Political Anchor Wolf Blitzer \"It was during the 7 p.m. Eastern hour when we started getting initial voting results from Florida and I noticed that Hillary Clinton wasn't doing all that great in the largely Democratic counties in South Florida.  She was winning in Miami Dade County, Broward County and Palm Beach County but certainly not with the lopsided margins that President Obama had in 2012 when he carried Florida. For a Democratic presidential candidate to win Florida, that candidate has to do really well in those three very large counties given that much of the rest of the state is historically Republican.  I noticed that while Hillary Clinton was winning in those three counties, I began to think her margins wouldn't be enough to carry the state. And if she didn't win Florida, I suspected she would be in real trouble elsewhere around the country. It was then that I suspected Donald Trump had a very good chance of winning the Presidency.\" CNN Producer Dan Merica \"Clinton's pool of reporters loaded up into the vans and made the trip into Manhattan, where we would be posted up at her campaign hotel - The Peninsula New York -- for the rest of the night. Clinton would remain ensconced in a suite at the top of the hotel, while the pool of reporters sat in a conference room (featuring two roll away beds) to watch the results with a small group of Clinton campaign staffers. No one in Clinton's campaign started out the night thinking they were going to lose -- and most of my conversations with campaign staffers during the day had been upbeat and hopeful. Sure, they had their concerns, but nothing different than normal Election Day jitters. That changed when Clinton lost Florida. The campaign had been banking on winning the states Obama had won in 2012 and Florida was key to that. She made 13 visits to Florida as the nominee, more than any other state in the country, including three visits in the last eight days of the campaign. It didn't help that the Florida loss came just minutes after Ohio -- where Clinton made 11 trips since the convention -- was called for Trump. After filing a quick note about Florida, I got up from my table and walked into the hallway to refresh my coffee. It was looking like a long night. It was there that I found Varun Anand, a stunned 22-year old Clinton staffer with his eyes glazed over. Anand, the Clinton campaign's press wrangler, had worked his way up from an intern in Clinton's office, giving his life over to the campaign for two years. 'What do I tell my family,' asked Anand, whose family immigrated to the United States from India when he was six. 'What do I tell them after the country elects Trump?' Earlier in the night, Anand's father called him concerned about the results in Florida and North Carolina. Anand assuaged him and listened as he talked about having trouble sleeping after former FBI Director James Comey briefly reopened the investigation into Clinton's emails on October 28. It was the first time that night that a Clinton campaign staffer, with any seriousness, acknowledged that Trump was on the verge of winning.  'I saw the writing on the wall,' Anand says of the exchange today.\" 11 p.m. ET: THE END IS NEAR National Politics Reporter MJ Lee \"The mood inside the Javits Center seemed to turn quickly. The cheerful atmosphere had turned overwhelmingly dark. You could feel it and see it all around -- so many blank stares and hushed tones and, eventually, the tears. At some point the big screens in the building, which had been going back and forth between campaign videos and the news, also went sent.  The most clarifying moment was probably when I noticed that people were starting to actually leave the party, even though the results had not been called. The crowd in front of the stage had thinned out (earlier in the evening, you could barely move in the pit) and a stream of people were walking out of the building, many of them huddled together and physically holding onto friends and family.  One woman, Kerry, was weeping as she headed toward the exits, saying she had to hurry home to her 16-year-old daughter. 'Because I promised her hope. I promised her hope. And this man is despicable,' she told me, sobbing. 'I don't know what happened. I'm so disappointed in this country, and I don't know what to say to her. I don't know what to tell her.\"  CLOCK STRIKES 12 THE CALL, AND THE CALL CNN Producer Cassie Spodak   \"I watched John Podesta speak around 2 a.m. and than caught a cab across town to Trump's election night party at the Hilton to try and interview the supporter I had been shadowing. I hadn't been able to get credentials to the actual party so I was waiting in the lobby while Trump spoke and then watched as his supporters streamed out. I saw Mike Pence's Press Secretary Marc Lotter come out. I asked him if he was going to move to Washington and he didn't even know what to say.  People were fist bumping and hugging in the lobby, with a look of stunned excitement on their faces. \"The silent majority has awakened,\" said Al Baldasaro, a New Hampshire adviser who had caused controversy by seeming to threaten Hillary Clinton.  A hour or so later, around 5 a.m., I saw Kellyanne Conway walking through the lobby of the hotel, she was on the phone with Trump, telling him she'd take any position he wanted for her.  A handler tried to keep me and another reporter away but Conway wanted to talk.  'President Obama did call him,' she said, 'they had a great conversation and they'll be getting together soon in Washington.'

It's exhilarating, it's exhausting, but it's also inexplicably complicated -- even for us natives. Here's everything you need to know to become an insta-pundit. \n \n  THE BASICS:    When's the election?  |  Why is the turnout so poor?  |  Why is the election on a work day?  |  Why does the campaign last so long?  |  Can anyone run for President?  |  Why does America have only 2 parties? \n  THE PROCESS:    What is the Electoral College?   |  Did anyone ever lose the popular vote and still become President?  |  What if there's a tie?  |  What are battleground states?  |  Why are Democratic states \"blue\" and Republican states \"red\"? \n  THE ISSUES:    What are the biggest issues?  |  What else are Americans voting on? \n  THE OUTCOME:    When will we know the result?  |  Can you really rig an election?  |  Can you contest the result?  |  When does the winner take office? \n  THE SIGNIFICANCE:  Just how unprecedented is this election? \n  THE BURNING QUESTION:  Who will win? \n When's the election?  Tuesday, November 8, for most Americans. Notice we say \"most.\" Millions will have already voted by then. That's because  early voting is a thing  in the US. It's estimated more than  40% of all votes  this year will be cast before Election Day -- a record. In some states, you can even vote early,  change your mind and vote again . Yeah, we make democracy really easy. Back to top Why is the turnout so pathetic?  All right, you got us with that one. Our country loves the hype  surrounding  the elections, but the actual election? Not so much. Just  53.6% of the voting-age population  cast a ballot in 2012 . Some can't. (Like felons. That's  6 million right there .) Some just don't feel like it. ( We're looking at you Hawai i and your lowest voter turnout in the country!). Compare that with  Belgium . In 2014, nearly 90% of those who could vote did. Back to top Why is the election on a work day? You can  thank Congress  for that one. Once upon a time,  America was a farming nation  that went to church on Sundays and market on Wednesdays. Holding elections on Tuesdays gave farmers enough time to get to the polls, get back home, and get their products to market. Hey, they weren't going to sacrifice capitalism for democracy.  Why November ? So, people could vote after the fall harvest, but before winter weather made travel difficult. Cut to 2016, and  we're STILL  DOING THAT !  There are proposals to move Election Day to the weekend, or make it  a federal holiday , but they've gone nowhere.  Back to top Why is the election season so darned long? We can see how this puzzles the world. Britain gets it done in 4 months, Canada in 2 and a 1\/2 and Japan in just TWELVE DAYS. America's two main political parties -- the Democrats and the Republicans -- pick nominees through contests called  primaries and caucuses in each of the 50 states  and the U.S. territories.  That process starts in February and it alone  takes up to five months ! Before that, candidates typically spend a year laying groundwork. They can start earlier, because there are  no laws dictating the length of a campaign . Because, you know, freedom.  But don't worry.  Sheryl Crow will make it all better .  Back to top Can anybody run for president? Yes, even Kanye West,  if he chooses . The  list of qualifications  listed in the US Constitution  isn't exactly long. It says you have to be at least 35 years old, have lived in the US for at least 14 years and be \"a natural born citizen.\" The good folks who put together the Constitution nailed down a lot of things, but the  exact definition of a natural born citizen   wasn't one of them. And neither Congress nor the Supreme Court have provided much clarity. ( Here, enjoy this light reading .)  That explains why the birthers who question President Obama's citizenship  won't shut up .  Back to top Why is it that the greatest country in the world only has two parties?  Actually America has a ton of them. There's the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, the Socialist Workers Party, even something called the Legal Marijuana Now Party. But for pretty much all of its history, the US has always had  just two dominant parties  that compete for the White House. These days it's the Democrats and Republicans. In middle of the 19th century, it was the  Democrats and the Whigs . It's primarily because of America's  winner-take-all elections . In other countries, 20% of the vote means you get some seats in parliament. In America, you get a sympathetic pat on the back and a \"you'll get 'em next time\" pep talk. Back to top Is it true Americans don't directly vote for President? The election is determined by this mysterious thing called  the Electoral College . Yeah, we were shocked when we learned this in our grade school civics classes too. It's complicated, so stay with us:  The  Electoral College  is  a group of people appointed by each party   The total number of electors is equal to the number of members in Congress:  538 Each state gets electors  based on its population . So, Wyoming has 3; New York has 29 So, if Candidate A wins the most votes in, say, New York, (s)he gets all 29 electoral votes. The goal is to  get to 270 , which is just over half of 538. Because of this wacky system, a candidate can get ZERO votes in THIRTY-NINE  states and DC and  still  win the presidency.  Back to top Has anyone ever lost the popular vote and still become president? Why don't you ask  Al Gore ?  He lost to George W. Bush in 2000, despite winning more votes nationwide. Back to top 538 is an even number. What if there's a tie? An Electoral College tie is extremely rare. It's  only happened twice . In a tie, one arm of Congress,  the House of Representatives , will elect the president, while the other,  the Senate , will elect the vice president. ( Here's a helpful chart ). This year, if there's a tie in the Electoral College, and the Republicans keep the House but the Democrats win back the Senate, it's quite possible that we'd be looking at a  Donald Trump-Tim Kaine administration,  a fitting end to the wackiest election we've ever seen. Isn't democracy wonderful? Back to top What are battleground states?  The way the Electoral College works now is that most states are reliably either \"blue,\" meaning they  vote for the Democratic candidate , or \"red,\" meaning they  go with the Republican candidate.  That leaves just a handful of states --  the battleground, or swing, states  -- that the candidates fight over, such as Florida. Florida is the swingiest swing state of all. In 2008 and 2012 it went for President Obama; in 2000 and 2004 it went for President Bush. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are neck-and-neck there.  Back to top Why are Democratic states 'blue' and Republican states 'red'? The media made it up . Both are colors in the American flag, and they look sharp on infographics because they're pretty much on opposite ends of the color spectrum. But the seemingly arbitrary color assignments have actually  flip-flopped over the years . In 1980, states won by Republican Ronald Reagan were colored blue; Democrat Jimmy Carter's states were colored red. Even as late as 1996, major media outlets were divided on how to color-code the parties.  Back to top What are the biggest issues? The usual suspects: The  economy, national security, health care . The issues are so big  the candidates  never seem to find time to talk about them. How could they, when there's private email servers and lewd hot-mic videos to discuss. On foreign policy :  Trump : His is an  America-first  strategy. He's suggested not coming to the aid of some countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and said he would work with challenging world leaders. Clinton : She wants to use  diplomacy and development  to quell problems abroad, stand by US allies, and stand her ground with rivals such as Russia and China. On trade :  Trump:  He's said the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a bad deal for America. He's also said he'd  renegotiate or end  the North American Free Trade Agreement and label China a currency manipulator. Clinton:  She used to call TPP the \"gold standard\" of trade agreements ... until it wasn't politically expedient anymore.  On climate change :  Trump:  He called global warming \"a hoax.\" He has  told coal miners he'd save their jobs  by reversing President Barack Obama's executive actions and dramatically cutting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. Clinton:  She wants to  combat climate change  and boost renewable energies, cut waste and reduce the United States' dependency on oil. Back to top What else are Americans voting on? We're voting to fill  all 435 seats  in the House of Representatives and  a third of the seats  in the Senate. The GOP majority in the House is so big it'll probably stay in Republican hands. But the  Democracts can flip the Senate  if they manage to  pick up just a handful of seats . On a state level,  eight states  will vote on  legalizing marijuana,  and  four states  will vote on  raising the minimum wage . And  only  California  would have something on the ballot like Proposition 60, which would require the use of condoms and \"other protective measures\" during the filming of porn.  Back to top When will we know the results?  Landslide elections are  usually called about 8 p.m.  ET when  most of the polls have closed  on the East Coast and in Central Time zones. This election seems  destined to be a nail-biter  though, so we'll be lucky if we know who won by midnight. If it all comes down to Ohio -- wouldn't be the first time -- and Trump and Clinton are pretty much tied, the whole thing could ride on  absentee and provisional ballots . But poll workers there have  a whole  10 days   to check eligibility. In that case, we wouldn't know the winner until the weekend before Thanksgiving. (Oh, and the Electoral College could  tie 269-269 . See above.) Back to top Can you really rig an election? In America? That'd be really hard. In the last presidential election some 129 million votes were cast, so just think about the  large scale of votes  you'd have to manipulate to even have an effect. Vote more than once?  That small army of poll workers and poll watchers (not to mention the lawyers) at each precinct can easily put a stop to that. Vote as someone else?  See above. Screw around with the voting machines?  Sure, but first you have to figure out how to break the locks and seals that are placed on each voting machine. And did we mention each machine sits out in the open all Election Day long? Hack the machines?  Yeah, good luck. The election system is decentralized by design, with state, county and local governments all managing voting. Even though many precincts use voting machines, none are connected to the Internet, nor are they connected to each other. It's probably a lot easier to just pick up a campaign sign, stand on a street corner and try to convince people that your candidate's the better option. You know, it's called  democracy . Back to top Can anyone contest the result? Well, sure, a candidate could, but  it's not so simple . Remember, America really doesn't have a national election as much as  a series of state elections . So if you're going to contest the  results , you'll have to  do it  state by state . And each state has its own laws and  exceptionally strict criteria  to entertain any foolish challenges.   Back to top When would the winner take office?  Back in the old days, the president was inaugurated  on March 20 . But travel across the country is much faster and easier than before (thanks, airplanes!). So, now  Inauguration Day  is January 20.  Back to top Just how unprecedented is this election ? It's kind of like that old Prince song: 2016, nothing compares to you.  For the first time, you have  a woman a step away from being president . That alone makes this campaign unique. And yet you  don't hear much buzz about it , probably because Clinton herself rarely mentions it. Older female voters seem geeked up by the possibility of having a Madame President, but female millennial voters are  surprisingly blah about it.  Probably because they already feel like they'll see a female president in their lifetimes They're just not sure if they want  this  female to be the first. For the first time, you have  a true outsider-businessman  who really could shake up business as usual in Washington. Change is the big call this election, and  nobody represents that more than The Donald . He's the ultimate Washington outsider -- he was the host of \"The Apprentice\" for goodness sake -- who doesn't give a damn about political tradition. For the first time, you have  a major party nominee who, until this weekend, was under FBI investigation . Clinton's email problems were kind of fading into the background, then  came roaring back .  For the first time, you have  a man seeking office who bragged about wanting to sexually assault women . That  \"Access Hollywood\" video  of Trump would have been the death knell for any other candidate. But Trump is, well, Trump, and he says and gets away with things other politicians can only dream about. For the first time, you have two of the most  despised, hated and untrusted candidates . If they were running against any other run-of-mill presidential candidate, they'd be toast.  Back to top Last question: Who's going to win? Hey, if we knew the answer to that one, we'd extend our prophetic talents to something much more worthwhile, like predicting lottery numbers. The general consensus seems to be that  this race is Clinton's to lose . But that's based on polls. And what have we learned about polls this year? Look at  Brexit . Or  Colombia . So let's just ride it out together.

The emerging agreement came as students from a high school in Florida  where 17 people were killed by a gunman  lobbied lawmakers to find a legislative response to the attack.  \"I think we can work this,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut who was seen in a lengthy discussion on the Senate floor Tuesday with Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. \"I hope Sen. McConnell is willing to have a structure debate on the floor that will allow us to see where the votes fall on a number of gun violence measures ... ultimately McConnell and Schumer have to come to that agreement.\" Cornyn also said that they were trying to find a way to bring legislation that would incentivize state and federal agencies to enter more information into  the country's background check database -- known as \"Fix NICs\"  -- to the floor. \"It requires consent,\" Cornyn said, noting that the debate likely wouldn't begin until after this week. Gun control efforts hit headwinds  Earlier in the day, it appeared  Republicans on Capitol Hill were steering the debate away from proposals to restrict gun purchases toward plans to beef up school security after the latest mass shooting at a Florida high school. While a group of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school  made the rounds pressing top leaders from both parties  to move legislation to ban assault-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips, expand background checks and raise the age for purchases of rifles, there is no appetite in either the GOP-controlled House or Senate to move any significant gun control bills. \"We had a considerable discussion about the school safety issue at lunch ... the view of the vast majority of my conference is that we should make progress on bills that we agree on,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters at the Capitol House Speaker Paul Ryan stressed his long held position on Tuesday morning that Congress  shouldn't be \"banning guns for law abiding citizens.\"  He said the appropriate response in the wake of the tragedy was to look at why the system failed to pick up warnings on the shooter and to make sure those with mental health or other issues don't get access to weapons. The number three House GOP leader echoed the need to drill down on what went wrong in the response from police on the ground. \"As people are contemplating new laws, I think the most important thing we can look at is what about all the laws that are already on the books that were not enforced, that were not properly implemented?  You know, I think what angered me the most is when I see breakdowns with law enforcement,\" said House GOP Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana,  himself a survivor of gun violence . Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who supports a measure to ban fire bump stocks and expand background checks, argued there were a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill who would not be satisfied with narrow actions.   \"It's not enough and there's a growing list of Republicans who agree it's not enough,\" he said. \"This time has been different already, I can tell you just from many meetings and conversations.\" Ryan and other leaders pointed out that the House  already approved a narrowly created measure  to patch up holes in the background check database, and urged the Senate to take action on that bill. But one leading House conservative, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, raised some concerns with that legislation, saying it lets bureaucrats take away Americans' Second Amendment liberties without a day in court. \"Here is what makes me mad is all these proposals don't address the problem,\" he said. \"I mean there's was like 30 (times) this kid interacted with government. The day of the terrible attack, it looks like the sheriff and law enforcement didn't do their job so now the answer is more government?\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, said he and other conservatives are preparing to unveil a package of proposals to beef up security in schools that could cost billions. He said the price tag for the proposal would be \"substantial,\" noting that \"it would start with a 'B,' not an 'M,'\" and that \"making our schools safe is something that I think all members of the Congress and the Senate are united in. How do you get there is a key question.\" One idea conservatives are discussing is providing a tax credit for retired veterans or teachers to be trained to carry guns at schools to help respond to attacks. Another is working to provide greater support to law enforcement agencies. \"What we don't want it to do is to be a message,\" Meadows said. \"We want it to actually be a results-oriented bill so normally when you do that it's significant dollars.\" He added that there was close coordination with President Donald Trump's top advisers.  \"I can tell you that the administration is engaged on a daily if not hourly basis, trying to get something done,\" he said.  More concerns from the Senate  Across the Capitol, Republican senators huddled for their weekly policy luncheon, but while members said they had a good discussion on guns, few seemed ready to act on any major proposals. \"I'm not sure there's anything we can do here that's going to prevent any of these things in the future, OK?\" said Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican. Sen. Patrick Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who pushed for a plan to expand background checks back in 2013, said he'd had promising conversations with some members about garnering support for his bill again, but he wasn't definitive he'd be able to get the votes.  \"I'm working on that,\" he said. \"There are several senators who voted 'no' in the past who are open to reconsidering. Where they will end up, I do not know.\" Republicans also seemed lukewarm on a plan floated by Trump last week to raise the age individuals have to be to buy a rifle. There appeared to be some openness to do that among a few Republicans  like Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida  and Pat Roberts of Kansas, but on Tuesday, Roberts didn't sound too optimistic. \"They backed off of that,\"  Roberts said of the White House's position . \"There's other things we should consider that would have a more dramatic effect.\" It appeared the only thing that had some support was Cornyn's Fix NICs bill, but even that has hit snags on both sides of the aisle. Democrats demand more  While many Democrats have supported the Fix NICs bill, which would incentivize federal and state authorities to enter more data into the country's background check system, Democrats argue it's not enough on its own.  \"We want full debate. Not just on Fix NICs but on legislation that would really do the job,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday. \"The students say Fix NICs is not enough. The American people say Fix NICs is not enough ... we need full debate ... I was gratified to hear Sen. Cornyn say let's debate these issues. I'd like to hear Sen. McConnell say that as well. Because we have a moral imperative to act and act in a real way. Not just a little wink at the NRA.\" If Democrats wouldn't support Fix NICs without universal background checks it could paralyze Congress from even passing the most narrow of the proposals they agree on. \"If we're going to fix NICs, what about really doing meaningful background checks?\" said Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine. Rep. Ryan Costello, a Republican from Pennsylvania, argued Congress needed to act even if it was just a small change. \"Passing a bill that is common sense even if it wouldn't have been the bill that would have prevented previous tragedy, isn't a reason not to pass the bill,\" Costello said.","articles_date":"27 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/27\/politics\/gun-control-congress-debate\/index.html","articles_title":"The path on guns is narrow, but emerging  ","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":283,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) With Election Day on the horizon, the candidates and their top surrogates are logging thousands of sky miles as they barnstorm across the country, making closing arguments and cajoling supporters to hit the polls. On Tuesday alone, Hillary Clinton's campaign hosted more than 10 events around the country with  big-name headliners hitting Florida, Wisconsin, Colorado, New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina and Ohio, where President Barack Obama pushed early voting. Donald Trump's side is no less busy, but his bench is shorter, with the nominee, his family, and running mate Mike Pence doing the bulk of the work. Trump alone is on pace to hit four states in three days, with four stops in Florida alone. His son, Donald Jr., was in Iowa on Tuesday, and his children will be hitting Michigan later in the week.  So what does it all mean -- what do these breakneck itineraries tell us? Actually, quite a bit. The campaigns' decisions right now offer a unique insight into how they view the race to 270 electoral votes -- they tell us about the states still in play and the demographics of voters the campaigns see as key to victory. In the final days of this increasingly tight contest, both Clinton and Trump will be thinking about where to deploy their precious human resources. And the places they choose to visit can be just as telling as those they skip. Clinton's deep roster of surrogates allows her to defend precious blue states like Colorado and Wisconsin while simultaneously keeping leading figures focused on battlegrounds like Florida and Ohio. Trump doesn't have the same star-studded lineup to stump for him in places he can't be. Here is a detailed at look at where Trump, Clinton and their most dedicated allies will be directing their attentions over the coming days.  Team Clinton Hillary Clinton Tuesday, November 1:  Clinton campaigned outside Tampa, Florida -- a state in which she had already spent two of the past three days. Her weekend travels took her to Daytona Beach and Miami, where she appeared onstage with Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony at a \"Get Out The Vote\" concert. Tampa, Daytona Beach and Miami offer distinct demographic opportunities and challenges. Tampa is in Hillsborough county, often the most hotly contested counties in the state, while Daytona Beach -- where Clinton made a pregame appearance at a Bethune\u2011Cookman University football game -- has a sizable African-American population. Miami, of course, offered a chance to run up the score, especially among Latino voters, in the Democratic stronghold. How hip-hop turned on Trump and settled for Clinton in 2016 Wednesday, November 2:  Clinton heads to the normally deep-red state of Arizona. Both its senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, oppose Trump (McCain after some hedging) and polls show the state's 11 electoral votes within reach.  But this stop, like Trump's planned foray into Wisconsin, could also be a ploy designed to set the other side on its heels -- forcing them to spend resources on defending a traditionally Republican state.  Thursday, November 3:  Clinton hits North Carolina with Sanders, which means one thing: Get the kids to the polls. Sanders was and remains a popular figure with left-leaning, younger Democrats, so anytime you see him on the schedule, expect that it's part of a plan to whip up millennial voters. Friday, November 4:  Clinton appears with hip hop star Jay-Z in Ohio, where early voting is underway and Clinton needs to run up a big margin in cities like Cleveland, with its considerable African-American and youth vote. Saturday, November 5:  Clinton will end the day in Philadelphia, for a concert headlined by Katy Perry -- another move to get the youth vote off the couch and enthused and help appeal to professional, highly educated women in the city and suburbs. (Trump is making a similar play by sending wife Melania Trump to speak in the Philadelphia suburbs this week.) President Barack Obama Tuesday, November 1:  Obama hits Columbus, Ohio, home to Ohio State University and more young voters the Clinton campaign needs to keep the incumbent's coalition intact. Obama's final mission: Help Clinton close the deal Wednesday, November 2:  Then to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and the University of North Carolina. Again, the goal here is to get out students and the highly-educated voters that tend to live in and around college towns. Thursday, November 3:  The President then heads to Miami, Florida,   a vote-heavy metropolis where he will appeal to the diverse cohort we now commonly refer to as the \"Obama coalition.\" Miami-Dade County delivered more than 6-in-10 of its votes for him in a narrow 2012 statewide contest. Vice President Joe Biden Tuesday, November 1:  Biden hit Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday -- another chance to appeal to the white, working-class vote that has been resistant to Clinton yet looks at the vice president as one of their own. Wednesday, November 2:  Then it's on to Tampa -- at the center of swinging Hillsborough County. Then it's on to Palm Beach and its population of seniors,   a group with which Biden has always performed well. Vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine Tuesday, November 1:  Kaine was in Wisconsin, playing defense in a state Democrats haven't lost in decades.  Wednesday, November 2 : It's off to Iowa, where the native Midwesterner -- Kaine was born in Minnesota and grew up on the Kansas City area -- will   try to make some inroads in a state that Trump has consistently led in the polls. (Update: This visit has been canceled following  an ambush that killed two police officers  in Iowa early Wednesday.) Thursday, November 3:  A day after Clinton, Kaine is set to visit Arizona (Phoenix and Tucson) himself -- another example of the Democratic ticket having the resources to put a sustained effort into an unlikely state. Former President Bill Clinton Tuesday, November 1:  With the nominee nearby, Bill Clinton made three stops in southern Florida on Tuesday, including events in Florida City and Immokalee. Both cities are minority-majority, a good play for Bill Clinton, who remains extremely popular among African Americans, a community that early-voting estimates suggest may not be turning out for the Democratic nominee in as strong numbers as in previous cycles. Wednesday, November 2:  Clinton heads back north a day later, with two stops scheduled in Iowa.  (Update: This visit has been canceled following  an ambush that killed two police officers  in  Iowa early Wednesday.) Chelsea Clinton Tuesday, November 1:  The former first daughter visited Aurora, Colorado. Wednesday, November 2:  Boulder and the University of Colorado is on the schedule for Wednesday, another play to get out the youth vote -- in this case, that mostly means mailing in their ballots -- in a state most polls show Clinton leading comfortably. Then it's off to play some more defense in Oshkosh and Eau Claire, Wisconsin, a state where Clinton has a strong but not unbreakable hold. Thursday, November 3:  Another day in Wisconsin, this time with at a coffee shop Milwaukee, not far from Marquette University. Friday, November 4:   Clinton's busy week ends in battleground New Hampshire, with stops planned in Keene and Hanover, home to Dartmouth College. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren Tuesday, November 1:  A busy day for Clinton's former primary rival, who stumped for her in Plymouth and Hanover, New Hampshire, before heading up to Portland, Maine. Wednesday, November 2:  Warren is expected to join phone-banking efforts in Carson City and Reno, Nevada, as the Silver State goes down to the wire. Meanwhile, Sanders will continue on his mission to burnish Clinton's liberal credentials, especially with young voters, of which there figure to be a few on hand at his visit to Western Michigan University. He'll also be in Traverse City, Michigan, before finishing the day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Over the coming days, he will also make appearances in Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada and California. Team Trump Donald Trump Tuesday, November 1:  Gaining in the polls, Trump took his anti-Obamacare message to friendly crowds in   King of Prussia, Pennsylvania -- a blue state that, if turned, could swing the election in a hurry. Trump also held a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.  Wednesday, November 2:  A busy day in battleground Florida will likely see Trump stops first in Miami, then up to Orlando and Pensacola. Thursday, November 3:  Before leaving the Sunshine State, Trump will look to shore up his base in Jacksonville, which like his latter two rallies on Wednesday, is farther north and in a more traditionally Republican leaning region. After that, Trump heads to North Carolina, another state where he could be gaining ground, for visits to Concord and Selma. Vice Presidential nominee Mike Pence Tuesday, November 1:  A full day in Pennsylvania. After joining Trump for the Obamacare speech in King of Prussia, Pence set off for another rally in Youngwood, a borough in the more Republican-heavy western part of the state about an hour outside Pittsburgh. Pence is often dispatched to more traditionally conservative areas, where he has a credibility that Trump does not. Wednesday, November 2:  Another busy day for the Indiana governor, who will first try to match voices with Clinton in Arizona. Pence will be in the GOP stronghold of Mesa, launching a rearguard action in one of the reddest cities in the country.  But after that he's scheduled to kick up some dust in New Mexico, a traditionally reliable blue state -- is it a feint or does the campaign see a path there? They're saying the polls are closer than we might expect. Pence finishes in Loveland, Colorado.  Melania Trump Thursday, November 3:  The prospective first lady is expected to give a speech in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia.  Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump Tuesday, November 1:  Trump's eldest son visited two Hawkeye State colleges, where he spoke to crowds at Iowa State University in Ames and at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls. Wednesday, November 2:  More higher ed for Trump Jr., when he'll visit Michigan and Grand Valley State University in Allendale. Like her brother, Ivanka Trump will also be in Michigan at a separate event on Wednesday, part of the campaign's offensive in another state expected -- for now, at least -- to go blue on Election Day. Friday, November 4:  Eric Trump will follow his older siblings to Michigan for an appearance at the end of the week. There are no details available yet about his or Ivanka Trump's events.

Republican senators gathered at the White House on Tuesday afternoon for an impromptu meeting with the President after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would be  postponing the vote on the health care bill  until after the July 4 recess. Nine Republican senators have said they will not vote for the bill and many of those opposing the current version were at the meeting. President Donald Trump said negotiators are continuing to work and \"getting very close\" on a deal and that Obamacare is \"melting down as we speak.\" \"We are going to talk,\" Trump told reporters during the meeting. \"We are going to see what we are going to do. We are getting very close.\" The seating arrangement around Trump during the meeting appeared to be strategic, with many of the undecided or \"no\" vote senators sitting closest to the President. Sitting immediately to the left of Trump was Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a noted moderate who has been on the fence about the health care bill for quite some time.  Earlier Tuesday, Collins  took a dig at the President , suggesting Trump's lack of political experience is partly to blame for the GOP's struggles to pass the legislation. \"It has been a challenge to him to learn how to interact with Congress and how to push his agenda forward,\" Collins told reporters Tuesday afternoon, shortly after the delay on the vote was reported. When she announced she had accepted the President's invitation to the White House on Tuesday, Collins explained her reasoning for her stance on the bill: \"I will say that I have so many fundamental problems with the bill that have been confirmed by the (Congressional Budget Office) report that it's difficult for me to see how any tinkering is going to satisfy my fundamental and deep concerns about the impact of the bill.\"  The Congressional Budget Office on Monday predicted that 22 million people will lose coverage if the Senate bill becomes law. After that prediction, Collins tweeted her opposition. Next to Collins was Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada. On Friday, Heller announced his opposition to the bill in its current form. \"It's simply not the answer,\" Heller said at a news conference alongside Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval in Las Vegas. \"And I'm announcing today that in this form, I simply will not support it.\" He said it is a \"lie\" that the bill would lower health care premiums.  \"There isn't anything in this bill that would lower premiums,\" Heller said. Almost immediately after  Heller's statement , the pro-Trump group America First Policies ran ads for 12 hours against the Nevada Republican over his public opposition.  The 30-second narrated television ad depicted Trump and Heller -- and did not mince words: \"Call Sen. Heller. Tell him America needs him to keep his promise: Vote 'yes' to repeal and replace Obamacare.\" The ad was pulled Tuesday evening. To the immediate right of Trump sat Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, another moderate who has said  she has concerns about the health care bill as it stands . \"I don't have enough data in terms of the impact to my state to be able to vote in the affirmative. So I'm trying to get the information. ... This is big stuff, and so making sure that we get it right is something that I have said is an imperative,\" Murkowski  told CNN in an interview  on Monday. After the  Congressional Budget Office score was released , prompting multiple Republicans to express doubts about the legislation or reiterate that they would not vote for the bill in its current form, Murkowski said she and her fellow senators should have time to examine the numbers and understand how the bill would impact their constituents before rushing to a vote. \"If you say, well, CBO numbers don't matter, let's look at the numbers that you don't think matter. But it really does make a difference,\" Murkowski told CNN's Dana Bash. \"And these numbers that we're talking about, these are men and women, these are our families that are being impacted. So let's please get it right.\" Two seats over from Murkowski was Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, another moderate GOP senator from a swing state. Gardner said he is still reviewing the 140-page bill but  has specific demands before he can commit to voting in support  of the bill. After the bill was made publicly available Thursday, Gardner told reporters, \"We need to learn more and get the information and numbers behind it. ...That's not a no. It's not a yes. We have to look at the numbers.\" Other senators who have  proclaimed their opposition , including Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, were also in attendance.","articles_date":"28 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/27\/politics\/gop-senators-seating-chart\/index.html","articles_title":"The strategic seating chart from the White House meeting with GOP senators","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":285,"issue":2,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) The most dramatic and unpredictable presidential election in decades is suddenly slipping into a strange state of suspended animation. Donald Trump and his team, facing widening deficits in the polls, insist the Republican nominee can still win. But he and his allies seem to be increasingly contemplating the possibility of defeat. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is sizing up the challenges of a possible presidency at a time of deep polarization even as her aides say she's taking nothing for granted. Clinton looking past Trump to transition planning With just over two weeks remaining before Election Day, much of the drama is shifting to Capitol Hill, where anxious Republican leaders -- estranged from their nominee -- can do little more than fret about how bad it could get. Trump's stumbling campaign threatens to wipe out the GOP's majority in the Senate -- and maybe even the House. Clinton will aim to build pressure on congressional Republicans Monday when she joins Sen. Elizabeth Warren in New Hampshire to slam GOP lawmakers for standing by Trump. Her clear target: Kelly Ayotte, one of the Senate's most vulnerable Republicans who has struggled to grapple with Trump's candidacy. Trump has been counted out before, so it's still too early to write him off. And voters -- not polls and pundits -- decide elections. But unless there is an abrupt Trump revival, another October surprise that could once again upend the race or a cataclysmic miss by the majority of pollsters, the Republican nominee seems to be on a glide path to defeat on November 8. Too far behind A new  ABC News national poll  released Sunday had Clinton 12 points up on Trump, clinching the support of 50% of likely voters nationwide. CNN's Poll of Polls gives the Democratic nominee a nine-point edge. The mounting evidence seems to be fueling a realization in the Trump camp that he may be too far behind to catch up \u2014 with hundreds of thousands of ballots already cast in some early voting states. Several times in recent days, the billionaire has appeared to be laying the groundwork for a defeat \u2014 whether with his claims of a rigged election that could be a face-saver if he loses \u2014 or in wistful musings about the days ahead. \"I don't want to think back, if only I had done one more North Carolina rally maybe I would have won by 500 votes instead of losing it by 200 votes,\" Trump said Friday, while adding a caveat that he still thinks he will win. \"I never want to look back,\" he said. \"I never want to say that about myself.\" Trump occasionally seemed tired on the stump over the weekend \u2014 though sometimes took heart from his large crowds. He was also less prone to depart his teleprompter for ad libs that land him in trouble. In Newtown, Pennsylvania, on Friday night, the Republican nominee appeared to admit his campaign needed a significant boost. \"I've wasted time, energy, and money \u2014 so you've got to get out,\" he said. \"We got to turn this thing around.\" And last Tuesday, Trump, a connoisseur of polls, said he had even lost faith in the few surveys that have him ahead. \"Now even though we're doing pretty good in the polls, I don't believe in the polls anymore,\" he said. Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway admitted the campaign's struggling position Sunday, but was loathe to give Clinton any credit for her lead. 'We are behind' \" We are behind ,\" Conway said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"She has tremendous advantages,\" Conway said of Clinton. \"She has a former president, happens to be her husband, campaigning for her, the current president and first lady, vice president, all much more popular than she can hope to be.\" But if Trump is going down, he will do it his way. He's showing that he will continue to lash out, is happy to settle scores with GOP critics like House Speaker Paul Ryan while he still can, and will use the media spotlight to wage his own personal battles before the American people. On Sunday night, the GOP nominee, who has spent months laying into the establishment,  pleaded with his supports to keep the House and Senate  in Republican hands even as he groused that he would like the party to do more to boost his campaign. \"Go out and vote and that includes helping me reelect Republicans all over the place,\" Trump said in Naples, Florida. \"I hope they help me too! It'd be nice if they help us too, right?\" But a day earlier, in the symbolic surroundings of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, he made clear that the campaign that was all about him from the start will end with him in the spotlight -- even if it's not in his best political interest. The event was billed as a chance for Trump to lay out a Contract With America-style agenda for his first 100 days as president in surroundings that resonate with a desire for national unity and reconciliation. But Trump characteristically stole his own headlines, threatening to sue women who accused him of sexual assault after the election and lambasting the media for rigging the race against him. Latest Trump accuser says he hugged, kissed her without permission Once again, he detracted from the meat of his message, which included detailed proposals on new ethics reforms and labeling China a currency manipulator along with plans to spark economic and jobs growth and a tough strategy to crush ISIS. Speaking with Jake Tapper Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Conway declined to say if she knew that her boss would weave such a personally focused tirade into his Gettysburg speech. 'This is his candidacy' \"He delivers his own speeches,\" she said. \"This is his candidacy. He's the guy who is running for the White House. And he has the privilege to say what he wants.\"  But Jane Hall, a professor of communications at American University, told CNN's \"Reliable Sources\"  Sunday that Trump was being himself and displaying the indiscipline that has hurt his campaign. \"He wasn't off message,\" she said. \"That is his message.\" Increasingly, Trump supporters are forced to cherry pick polls that show their candidate competitive, or to place their faith in crowd sizes and enthusiasm on the trail, metrics that often seem attractive to lagging campaigns. Trump's son Eric, for instance, said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" that he doesn't put much \"credence\" in the ABC poll, denying he was in a \"bubble\" where Trump's support seems broader than it is. \"He had 10,000 people in Cleveland,\" Trump said. \"You know, Hillary and -- and Tim Kaine, they were in Pennsylvania. They had 600 people in a gym. I mean the  enthusiasm levels are just totally -- totally off the charts.\"  Such thinking is not confined to Trump's family. Author JD Vance, author of a new book \"Hillbilly Elegy\" on the working class white voters that form Trump's constituency, said the Republican nominee's supporters don't believe he is losing. \"I think a lot of folks think that the polls don't reflect reality,\" Vance said on CNN's \"Smerconish\" on Saturday. \"If Trump loses, as the polls tell us he will, I do think a lot of folks are going to be very surprised.\" Looking to Britain for inspiration With the data looking ominous, other Trump supporters are looking for inspiration from voters in Britain, which voted to leave the European Union earlier this year in defiance of polls that suggested the opposite result. \"I do think there is a Brexit out there ... I am almost positive there is a Brexit out there. I don't know how big it is, I think that remains to be seen,\" Andre Bauer, the former Republican Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina said on CNN on Thursday night. One veteran Republican said privately Saturday that there are some senior members of the party who still believe Trump can win. But the Republican added that many of those making Trump's case on television have already written him off. The US Chamber of Commerce, meanwhile, has already made its call. The key Republican interest group is throwing money behind an ad backing Ayotte in New Hampshire, telling voters they must send her back to Washington to act as a check on the White House -- with the clear implication that Clinton will be president. Perhaps most galling to Trump, Clinton is signaling that she is looking past him \u2014 seeking a more positive, uplifting message as her campaign machinery gears up a formidable get-out-the-vote operation. She told reporters Saturday that she would no longer reply to his more controversial statements. \"I debated him for four and a half hours,\" she said. \"I don't even think about responding to him anymore.\" She added: \"I am going to let the American people decide about what he offers and what we offer.\" CNN's Jeff Zeleny reported on Sunday that Clinton had already reached out to some Republican senators, including allies from her days on Capitol Hill, saying she hopes to work with them to govern. And in another sign the campaign is looking to the future, her running mate, Tim Kaine, named Wayne Turnage as his transition director. Clinton's team is also looking at expanding the electoral map in search of a more decisive victory than polls suggest is on the cards, moving into Arizona and considering a run at Utah -- states that are typically solid GOP territory. However, Clinton's campaign manager  Robby Mook told CNN's Tapper  on Sunday that no one is counting chickens. \"We don't want to get ahead of skis here, so we're just as focused on Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, other states as we have ever been,\" Mook told Tapper. \"We have a very clear message to our supporters: Let's double down, nose to the grindstone, and keep working.\" CNN's Ashley Killough, Dana Bash and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.","articles_date":"24 10 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/10\/24\/politics\/election-2016-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\/index.html","articles_title":"The tumultuous 2016 campaign is in a sudden limbo","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":286,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"David A. Andelman, visiting scholar at the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School and director of its Red Lines Project, is a contributor to CNN and columnist for USA Today. Author of \"A Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today,\" he formerly served as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News in Asia and Europe. Follow him on  Twitter @DavidAndelman . The views expressed in this commentary are his.  (CNN) A key question of who has the right to declare war -- Donald Trump or Congress (as the US Constitution demands) -- is quietly playing out these days, largely out of sight.  The outcome of this potentially monumental dispute could keep the world safe or plunge it into sudden and unexpected conflict -- with catastrophic consequences. Since 9\/11, American presidents have been operating under the assumption that they could effectively take the nation to war with virtual impunity. Now, Donald Trump has tried to enshrine this concept in a secret memo without any approval by Congress. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA)  unveiled the existence of the memo earlier this month , when he asked Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to release the document. So far, neither Tillerson nor Congress has responded.  Kaine said he was \"concerned that this legal justification may now become precedent for additional executive unilateral military action,\" and singled out \"an extremely risky 'bloody nose' strike against North Korea.\" The memo is only the latest act by Trump that would appear to give him all but unfettered authority beyond his whim or declaration to take the US into a conflict.  The fear is that a thoroughly erratic president could, in a moment of pique order, or even as a distraction, embark on an adventure that would set the nation and the world on an irreversible course that Congress would be powerless to halt.  The still-undisclosed powers contained in the Trump memo could spark unanticipated skirmishes like the ambush in Niger last October, leaving dead Americans in their wake. At the other end of the spectrum, they might unleash events that could lead potentially to a nuclear holocaust.  The President has  already opened the question  of whether he'd violated the limit of his war-making powers by his military actions in Syria.  Last April, following evidence of the use of chemical weapons against his own people by Bashar al-Assad,  Trump ordered a strike by 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles  that seemed to have had little lasting effect beyond solidifying Russian support of the Syrian dictator.   Trump's action was in sharp contrast to that of President Obama, who threatened to launch a strike on Syria for similar use of such weapons but backed off at the last minute in the absence of congressional authorization, which he recognized he was most unlikely to receive.   In each case, the presidents had set up a \"red line\" which, if the enemy crossed it, would be met by a sharp military response.  I'm heading up a project at the Center on National Security of Fordham Law School on red lines and their anatomy -- when they might be effectively used and when they are grossly misused. Obama's refusal to react to Syria's abuse of chemical weapons called into question the red line he had established, a line that Assad leaped across with impunity since he was met with no military response.  This may well have led Assad to believe he could cross such a red line again, but did not count on Trump's willingness to act on his own authority to attack, with little thought to his constitutional limitations. In fact, the issue is vastly more complex.  Bruce Ackerman, Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science at Yale, observed in an interview that the issue of such red lines and presidential authority to attack dates back to Thomas Jefferson and his action  against the Barbary Pirates in 1801 .  More recently, and pertinently, we have an example from 1973, when Congress passed the war powers resolution. At that time, in reaction to Richard Nixon's expansion of the Vietnam War, Congress spelled out in some detail just what rights the President has to mount an offensive operation -- effectively 60 days to send in troops, then in the absence of Congressional approval,  another 30 days to withdraw.   One key issue is when this 60-day period begins. Ackerman, and many other legal scholars, hold that \"hostilities begin when there is an imminent danger.\"  In the critical case of North Korea, Ackerman contends the clock started when President Trump declared the existence of such a danger in a speech to the United Nations last September 19, which would mean his opportunity to bloody Kim's nose, without Congressional approval, ran out on November 18.  Of course, if the North Korean despot were to launch his own offensive attack on any American facility or territory, all such restraints are instantly removed and Trump would have the right to respond, as he has threatened, with full \"fire and fury.\" Enter, now, the secret memo that may give Trump broad authority to act on any whim, a document to which only a small cadre in his administration are privy.  The timing is especially acute,  as the nation's intelligence chiefs told a Senate hearing Tuesday  that Kim Jong-un was planning more missile and nuclear weapons tests this year -- though likely no direct offensive against the US.  The concern of an increasingly broad spectrum of Trump opponents is that the President has been effectively setting up a succession of red lines that could lead to him suddenly and unilaterally declaring had been crossed.  There have been threats to China in the South China Sea; Iran and its spreading influence in the Middle East; and in the case of North Korea, a \"bloody nose\" to teach Kim Jong-un a lesson. Any of these could quickly develop into full-blown nuclear war. What this means is that Trump's war powers memo, appropriately scrubbed for any classified \"sources and methods,\" needs to see the full light of day, deserves a full national debate and discussion, even Congressional action.  It is bad enough that the President has virtually unfettered access to the nuclear launch codes. Any other means of inflicting an ill-advised \"bloody nose\" must be restrained at all costs if the nation and the world is not to be plunged into an irreversible conflict of catastrophic proportions on an ill-advised whim.

On Wednesday, CNN reported  House speaker, Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan , would be next. Already, at least 43 House Republicans have announced they are retiring, running for another office or resigning outright, including Ryan. They're leaving from all over the map, from southern New Jersey to southern New Mexico. Democrats need to pick up 24 House seats to retake the majority from Republicans, who've had control of the House since 2011. Republican leadership has acknowledged it has a problem.  \"We've got to find better ways to empower people where they feel like this is worth their time,\" Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas, a former two-term National Republican Congressional Committee chair who met with several members to discuss retirements,  told the National Journal  in September. But the retirements kept coming. While midterm elections are historically tough for the party of the President in power, it's too early to tell how things will unfold this year. But seats are opening up all over. A few seats will be filled by special elections before next November. But most won't. The locations of some of these seats were pivotal during the push for health care reform and tax reform in 2017. Reps. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania were courted during the health care debates for their votes. Both have high numbers of Medicaid enrollees in their districts. Property taxes are high in New Jersey, and LoBiondo objected to the repeal of the state and local tax deduction during the tax reform debates. Some states are seeing higher numbers of open seats. And not all of the vacancies are coming from Republicans. Several vacancies opened in Texas, including the blue 16th Congressional District, won by Democrat Beto O'Rourke in 2016. He announced that he plans to run for the Senate in 2018. Seats have opened as a result of sexual harassment inquiries or accusations. Among Democrats,  Reps. Ruben Kihuen of Nevada  and  John Conyers of Michigan  announced they would leave Congress following pressure to resign, though Kihuen plans to finish his term. On the Republican side, Rep.  Trent Franks of Arizona resigned  and Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas  announced he will resign , both following sexual harassment accusations. The campaign committees on both sides of the political aisle are eyeing the 23 Republicans defending districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 and the 12 seats  held by Democrats in districts that President Donald Trump won. These are seen as vulnerable seats to flip. But many of the Republican retirements are occurring in districts where Trump narrowly carried the vote, like New Jersey's 2nd or Michigan's 11th. Members from these districts could have faced tough re-elections this year, when Democrats are expected to be strong performers, potentially regaining control of the House. Republicans who say they will run for other offices are more likely to come from districts where Trump performed well. These members vote in alignment with the President at a high rate. They may count on continued support from his base to propel them into higher office. With few exceptions, the Republicans and Democrats who are retiring largely vote along party lines. They also have levels of support for the President's agenda similar to those of their respective parties. Past research has found the emergence of \"strategic retirement\" by politicians when they think re-election is less likely. The recent results in Virginia and subsequent Republican departures suggest this phenomenon may be in effect. Here is the full list of representatives  so far who have announced that they plan to leave office, broken down by whether they said they will resign, retire or run for another office. Some members resigned before their terms ended. While the number of Democrats and Republicans planning to run for another office is close in number, the number of House Republican retirements dwarfs those announced by Democrats. Members from either party planning to run for another office tend to run for Senate seats or governorships. Scandal has also led to some resignations. Rep. Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania announced he would retire after  the anti-abortion GOP congressman admitted that he had had an affair and had urged an abortion .

For others, the process could take much longer.\u00a0 The illegal immigrants arrested in the sweep last month were divided into three basic categories: fugitives who had outstanding deportation orders against them, those who already had been deported and illegally re-entered the U.S., and at-large convicted criminals.\u00a0 Those in the first two categories will once again be slated for deportation, though those in the second category could also face prosecution in the U.S. for the crime of illegal re-entry. The timing of their deportation would vary, depending on factors like travel documents, the availability of flights and whether their home countries will take them.\u00a0 But those in the third category will be placed into removal \"proceedings\" before a federal immigration judge. That judge then has the discretion to order them deported or grant some form of relief to remain in the U.S.\u00a0 \"They're afforded due process,\" a federal immigration official said.\u00a0 And that process can take a while. According to a report last fall by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, it took an average of 280 days for the immigration courts to act on cases in fiscal 2010, the last year for which data was available.\u00a0 ICE could not provide a breakdown of what's happened to the 2,064 convicted criminals and fugitives swept up in prior Cross Check arrests. However, the agency reported that more than 122,000 criminal aliens have been removed from the country since Oct. 1.\u00a0 ICE officials touted the latest raid as a message to illegal immigrant criminals that they will get caught. Among those arrested were a Libyan living in Denver convicted of first-degree sexual assault against a child and a Filipino living in Orlando convicted of battery on a law enforcement officer.\u00a0 \"The results of this operation underscore ICE's ongoing focus on arresting those convicted criminal aliens who prey upon our communities and tracking down fugitives who game our nation's immigration system,\" ICE Director John Morton said in a statement.\u00a0 The operation also sends a message to states and cities that have lashed out against a separate federal-local partnership known as Secure Communities -- through which   fingerprints are checked against Homeland Security Department databases to see if a suspect is in the country illegally. Some states, like New York, recently came out against the program, expressing concern that it is preventing people in the immigrant community from working with law enforcement.\u00a0 But ICE stressed that in the Cross Check raid federal officials were only targeting serious offenders. It came after new guidelines were issued for Secure Communities to focus the screening efforts on dangerous criminals.\u00a0 While the administration is narrowing its immigration enforcement to criminals and fugitives, others say that approach is not doing the trick.\u00a0 Corey Stewart, chairman of the   County Board of Supervisors in Virginia, called the arrests announced Tuesday a \"drop in the bucket.\" He expressed concern that federal officials are still letting far too many illegal immigrants off the hook for minor crimes, which can lead to major crimes. In Prince William County, two illegal immigrants with prior records were charged in connection with deadly crimes in the span of just six months.\u00a0 Stewart acknowledged that many of those swept up in the latest arrests will likely face deportation.\u00a0 \"They're probably going to deport most of them. ... These are very serious criminals,\" he said. \"But again, it's just the tip of the iceberg.\"","articles_date":"21 06 2011","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2011\/06\/21\/feds-announce-mass-arrest-illegal-immigrants.html","articles_title":"Thousands Poised to Enter Deportation Process After Mass ICE Arrest","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":289,"issue":5,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Virginia Sen.

Kaine's Spanish speech includes the Hispanic community and over 40 million Spanish-speaking Americans in the conversation during this election. The speech was coupled with a Spanish-language media push with Univision and Telemundo, and Kaine took over the Spanish-language Hillary Clinton Twitter account, @Hillary_ESP. The outreach strategy seemed to be working \u2014 Telemundo led their evening broadcast with Kaine's speech.  \"While we wanted to do the speech in Arizona for very specific reasons, our goal is obviously to reach more broadly across the country to the Latino community,\" said Kaine communications director Karen Finney, pointing to high registration and early vote numbers from the Latino community in Arizona. \"The Latino vote is going to make a huge difference and I don't think that those that folks are going to turn out for Donald Trump.\"  Kaine told Thursday's audience that the power of the Latino vote will make a \"historical difference\" in next week's election, and emphasized the value of the Latino community, making a direct appeal.  \"Whether your family got here recently, or whether your family has been here since before the US came to be Hillary Clinton and I believe that you are our brothers and sisters, and we will fight for all of you.

He served as a federal appellate law clerk and then practiced civil rights law for 17 years in state and federal courts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.  (CNN) As a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees -- and the father of a Marine -- my job is to minimize the risk of unnecessary war and maximize the chance that we will decisively win any war we must fight.  And like many Americans, I am very disturbed that we may be drifting toward an avoidable war with North Korea. Our national security experts -- including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u2014 rightly point out that the US prefers diplomacy over war and is never out of diplomatic options. But President Donald Trump often undercuts them by tweeting out juvenile challenges to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un or dismissing the prospect that diplomacy might work.  Throughout history, we have seen how back-and-forth provocations, mistakes and miscommunications can lead to large unintended conflicts. President Trump's rash actions raise the prospect of \"war by accident.\"  We need to avoid a costly and catastrophic war on the Korean Peninsula. And creative diplomacy can help us do so. What must we do? First, the President should quit raising the risk.  He should cut out the inflammatory tweets. He should maintain a strong partnership with South Korea -- the absence of an ambassador to South Korea for almost a full year sends the message that he doesn't take this important relationship seriously. (Victor Cha, the Georgetown professor Trump picked for the post only last month has yet to be formally nominated for Senate confirmation.) Trump should express openness and desire for a diplomatic path, rather than demeaning those who pursue it. Second, we need to show North Korea that we would stand by our diplomatic deals.  The President's  threat to terminate  the Iran nuclear deal -- which our international partners and the International Atomic Energy Agency say is working -- suggests that the US will not honor a deal once it's made. If Trump does back out, it would make any potential partner wary of entering into a future deal with America. It is important for the administration and Congress to be scrupulous in honoring our commitments under the deal so long as it is being complied with. Third, we must continue to invest in protecting ourselves and reassuring our allies -- like South Korea and Japan -- that we will help defend them.  The administration is doing well by continuing past commitments to those nations and  positioning military assets  to provide additional protection in the event of increasing North Korean aggression. The recently signed National Defense Authorization Act includes investments to provide additional protection to the United States from the growing risk that North Korea poses to us. Fourth, the administration must continue to recognize the important role of China in this challenge.    Because we have no relations with North Korea, our leverage is minimal.  But China is a lifeline to North Korea and should be using its leverage to promote stability in the region. Sometimes,  we act like a supplicant,  begging China to assist in the effort. The reality is that China has much to lose in a war on the Korean Peninsula, which would deeply affect its economy and risk massive migration of North Koreans coming over the border.  Fifth, Congress must reclaim its oversight of the President's power to initiate war.   While a President can always act unilaterally to defend America from an imminent attack, Congress is supposed to hold the power to start an offensive war. Presidents of both parties over the years have taken advantage of a congressional abdication of responsibility in this regard and  seized for themselves  the right to start wars, even in the absence of any imminent threat to our country.  For instance, in April, the Trump administration  fired missiles at an  airbase in Syria to respond to that country's barbarous use of chemical weapons. The administration has not claimed that any US personnel were at risk and has not provided clear domestic and international legal justification for such military action. Unless Congress reasserts its important constitutional power, the risk of an unchecked President starting an unnecessary war will remain high during this administration. Finally, we must be creative in finding a diplomatic path forward. We want North Korea to denuclearize, but the administration's approach has been all sticks and no carrots. What might North Korea want in order to stop developing nuclear weapons? What if a peace deal to end the Korean War were on the table? Not many Americans realize that nearly 70 years since the Korean War began, the conflict is in  a cease-fire mode  -- with an armistice stopping active hostilities, but no peace deal. It's still a cold war. Part of the North Korean mindset has been to justify its weapon programs on the grounds that there is no peace accord; American troops are amassed on its border and the war could begin again at any moment. The development of weaponry, including nuclear weapons, became part of a defensive strategy to protect the country and the current regime.  Over the years, North Korea has broached the idea of a peace treaty to end the war. We should engage in dialogue without precondition and see whether an offer of a peace deal might provide North Korea with a degree of comfort that would reduce its motive to keep pouring resources into militarization, instead of meeting the needs of its people. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has also called for such a proposal to bring lasting peace to the peninsula.  By taking these steps, the Trump administration could show a true commitment to peace and ultimately avoid catastrophe. We have seen the painful consequences of unnecessary war, and we risk stumbling into another one if President Trump doesn't get serious about diplomacy with North Korea.","articles_date":"3 1 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/01\/03\/opinions\/how-trump-can-avoid-north-korea-catastrophetim-kaine\/index.html","articles_title":"Tim Kaine: How to avoid stumbling into a North Korea catastrophe","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":295,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said Thursday that  recent speculation among Republican members of Congress about the possibility of impeaching Hillary Clinton if she's elected suggests that they think they are going to lose on Election Day.

He served as a federal appellate law clerk and then practiced civil rights law for 17 years in state and federal courts.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.  (CNN) Sunday is the  230th Anniversary of the US Constitution . The document was finalized in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787, and we celebrate that day every year as Constitution Day. Today we're reminded we need to fully grasp the heritage we have inherited.  And in 2017, so many do. From the Women's Marches across the country in January, to the spontaneous demonstrations against the President's ill-considered Muslim ban, to a flood of first-time candidates pledging to run for office, to a dramatic  uptick  in citizens reaching out to members of Congress by mail, phone, email and in person, we see that the civic roles assigned to us by James Madison and others still have vitality and purpose.  Recall what had brought the drafters to this pivotal moment: They had lived through the pain and triumph of the Revolutionary War and then saw the nation founder in its initial years, its inadequate national government unable to bind together the states. And so the framers gathered to create a national government, with checks and balances to avoid abuses of power that they could easily foresee.  They were worried about government dominating individuals. They were worried about a national government dominating the states. And they were worried that the newly created office of the President could put the nation at risk of a power grab by a single individual. And so they tried to temper these concerns by building in the checks and balances we learn about in elementary school civics lessons. The Constitution had many imperfections and we had to fight a war to correct the most egregious of them -- the embrace of slavery, in direct contradiction of the equality principle we professed in the Declaration of Independence. But today I give thanks that the Constitution assigned us all roles to play in the continuing effort to perfect the union. Congress is the Article 1 branch because the framers wanted the people's elected legislative body to be \"first among equals\" with a primacy over the President whose powers are described in Article 2. The federal judiciary created in Article 3 received the unusual guarantee of life tenure so they could face down actions of Congress or the President without fear for their jobs.   The press was assigned a critical role in the First Amendment. States were given wide berth to manage their own affairs. But the most important powers were those given to individuals. The power to vote, thankfully expanded over time (though we have work to do to protect this right, as some try to erode it). The freedom to worship as one pleases and to express oneself, designed as much to prod society to progress as to protect the individual. And the power \"peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\"  From the very beginning, the framers understood that the power of the people was not just limited to casting a ballot, but extended much more widely. There are so many anxieties about politics today and about the direction of the country. But on this Constitution Day, I celebrate the role of the individual to vote, to speak, to peacefully protest and to shape, through civic activism, the direction of the country. And I see throughout my Commonwealth and country a great energy and spirit to do just that. It is this popular activism that stopped Congress from a disastrous one-party repeal of the Affordable Care Act, despite repeated votes to do so in the past. People power works and we need more of it. We must always balance that popular activism with a requirement to be peaceful -- violence has no place in civic discussion. We saw the dead-end of violence in my state, as white supremacists brought hatred, bigotry, assault and even death to Charlottesville in August. I am glad that Congress unanimously condemned this violence and the attitudes that inspire it. The President has  now signed our resolution.      We cannot tolerate violence by anyone, of any political viewpoint, if we truly embrace the principles expressed in the Constitution. So let's vigorously play the roles that we have the fortune to inhabit. So many around the world don't have the freedoms we do. We can be powerful in our energy and activism if we do so peacefully and respectfully while allowing all others to do the same.","articles_date":"17 9 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/09\/17\/opinions\/constitution-day-kaine\/index.html","articles_title":"Tim Kaine: The founding fathers wanted you to be a (peaceful) activist","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":298,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Tom Price is apparently a big fan of private airplanes.  This comes from Politico : \"In a sharp departure from his predecessors, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price last week took private jets on five separate flights for official business, at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars more than commercial travel. The secretary's five flights, which were scheduled between Sept. 13 and Sept. 15, took him to a resort in Maine where he participated in a Q&A discussion with a health care industry CEO, and to community health centers in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, according to internal HHS documents.\" Look. Private planes are great! (I flew on one while covering the 2005 gubernatorial campaign as Tim Kaine -- and then Democratic Gov. Mark Warner -- made a series of stops around the state in the fall of that race.) They are easier! You don't have to go through security! You can be on your phone!  But, when you are a government official -- who is not the President of the United States -- you have to be smart enough to realize that jetting around on private, um, jets sends exactly the wrong message to the people paying your salary. There's nothing more elitist and upper-crusty than a private jet. It's like a scene out of \" Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous ,\" (Yes, I watched a LOT of that show as a kid. And, double yes, Donald Trump is shown walking with Michael Jackson in the show's famous intro.) The last thing you want as a public servant is to be perceived as asking for and receiving special (and better) treatment than the people you are there to represent. Price should know better. He spent more than a decade in Congress prior to being nominated as Secretary of Health and Human Services by President-elect Trump in late 2016. In fact, in 2009 Price railed against  congressional expenditures in the hundreds of millions of dollars for several private planes that would ferry members of Congress . \"This is just another example of fiscal irresponsibility run amok in Congress right now,\"  Price said in a CNBC interview at the time . Whoops! Republicans also sought to make hay out of then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's alleged use of a 757 to jet her across the country to her San Francisco district.  Those charges were largely debunked . The usual explanation from politicians when caught using private jets is that there were simply no commercial airline flights available to get them where they needed to go. Unfortunately for Price, Politico appears to have him dead to rights on that claim. This paragraph is a gut punch for Price : \"Price's spokespeople declined to comment on why he considered commercial travel to be unfeasible. On one leg of the trip -- a sprint from Dulles International Airport to Philadelphia International Airport, a distance of 135 miles -- there was a commercial flight that departed at roughly the same time: Price's charter left Dulles at 8:27 a.m., and a United Airlines flight departed for Philadelphia at 8:22 a.m., according to airport records.\" This is also not the first time -- this month! -- that a Trump administration official has faced criticism for his flying habits. Treasury Secretary  Steve Mnuchin was battered last week by reports that he had inquired into the possible use of a government plane for his honeymoon . He insisted it was only a preliminary request driven by national security concerns. When the wrap on the president and his administration is that it's a bunch of rich white guys who are totally out of touch with how regular people live (even while insisting they are the voice of the people), it's not a good look to be flying on private planes. That's Politics 101. Price must have missed that class.","articles_date":"20 9 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/09\/20\/politics\/tom-price-private-jet\/index.html","articles_title":"Tom Price's private jet problem","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":299,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) The mystery surrounding the death of US Border Patrol agent Rogelio \"Roger\" Martinez is nowhere close to being solved. In the more than two months since Martinez's patrolled the West Texas desert for the last time, the FBI interviewed hundreds of people, combed through cellular data and analyzed DNA from the scene.  Yet, authorities are still trying to determine how Martinez got injured and eventually died. Here is what we know about the mysterious death and the investigation.  What happened? Martinez, 36, died late on the evening of November 18. He was patrolling alone near Interstate 10 when he stopped his vehicle about 12 miles east of Van Horn, Texas.  About 11:20 p.m. Martinez and another agent, Stephen \"Michael\" Garland, were found injured near a concrete-lined culvert -- a tunnel used for water drainage.  The agents were patrolling in separate vehicles and it's unclear why both ended up at the culvert, according to the Border Patrol. Martinez had severe head injuries and other wounds such as broken bones. He was flown to a hospital in El Paso that night and died a few hours later, the FBI said. Garland was also injured but he survived. He told investigators he doesn't remember anything about what happened. They called for help The FBI says Garland spoke to a Border Patrol dispatcher on the phone. He was disoriented and unsure of his location, but he told the dispatcher he and Martinez were hurt. \"The second Border Patrol agent also made a statement to the effect of, 'We ran into a culvert,' 'I ran into a culvert,' or 'I think I ran into a culvert,'\" the FBI said. The Border Patrol dispatch told Garland to go to his vehicle and activate his emergency lights so that first responders could find them, the FBI said. Authorities were also alerted by Garland's wife, who called the Van Horn Border Patrol station saying she'd received a cell phone call in which her husband seemed confused and disoriented, according to an agent who spoke with her. No evidence of murder Authorities appear ready to rule out the possibility that Martinez and his partner were attacked or ambushed.  The agents did not suffer \"defensive wounds\" and investigators did not find \"third-party blood or DNA evidence\" in the scene or the agents' clothing, according to an internal memo, from acting US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, which was obtained by CNN. In the memo, McAleenan also indicated that no evidence suggested other people other than the agents were at the scene the night of the incident. \"None of the more than 650 interviews completed, locations searched, or evidence collected and analyzed have produced evidence that would support the existence of a scuffle, altercation, or attack,\" the FBI said in a statement released Wednesday. In December, agents were chasing a tip that  two undocumented brothers, suspected drug smugglers , had attacked the agents, according to a search warrant filed unsealed in New Mexico. But they are not connected to Martinez's death, or his partner's injuries, the FBI said Wednesday. No other suspects have been linked to the incident. The FBI has considered other theories, such as an accident or an altercation between the two agents, a Department of Justice official with knowledge of the investigation had said. Emmerson Buie Jr., the special agent in charge of the FBI's El Paso division, said investigators have not \"conclusively determined\" how the two agents ended up at the bottom of the culvert. A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson declined to comment on the case. Autopsy results are inconclusive A medical examiner in Texas said Martinez died from blunt injuries to his head, but  the manner of his death is \"undetermined,\"  according to an autopsy report released Tuesday. Martinez had fractures to his skull, right jaw, upper ribs and his right collarbone, the report by the El Paso County Medical Examiner's Office says. The agent had cuts in his scalp, the report says, and a large bruise on his right shoulder. There was also a purple discoloration behind his right ear. A toxicological test found a small amount of the barbiturate butalbital in Martinez's blood. The drug is often combined with aspirin or acetaminophen to treat headaches and pain. Some believe it was an attack Despite the FBI's conclusion that there's no evidence of an attack, the Border Patrol union still believes the agent's injuries were the result of an attack. \"Our view hasn't changed. Our view is he was attacked,\" Chris Cabrera, a spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council told CNN referring to the FBI's investigation. \"It seems to me that they don't have any leads.\" The union was quick to say the agents were attacked after the incident. The assertion has been echoed by Texas politicians such as Gov. Greg Abbott, Sen. Ted Cruz and others.  On Twitter, President Donald Trump said the injured agent had been \"brutally beaten\" and called again for the construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico. Culberson County Sheriff Oscar Carrillo, who responded that night, said it didn't look like an attack to him. Agent's family finds it hard to believe Martinez's fianc\u00e9e, Angela Ochoa, and his family have said they don't understand how the agent suffered such severe injuries. \"I find it hard (to believe) that a fall could have caused all the damage that he had,\" she said. \"And as far as him being sideswept, that couldn't have happened because he was not off the freeway, he was on the side road. From the damage to his face, there's no way -- there's no way,\" she said.  \"I did ask if it was possible he was attacked by rocks and I was told there was no evidence he was attacked by rocks,\" Ochoa said. She believes the answers may lie with surviving agent Garland. \"I mean, I know he saw something,\" Ochoa told CNN in December. \"I know he knows. But what he knows, I can't tell you. I don't know.\" Neither she nor the Martinez family had heard from Garland since the agent's death, she said. Surviving agent wants to remember Garland has remained out of the public eye. He suffered significant injuries to his head and back but was released from the hospital a few days after the incident, walking with a cane, officials said. Less than two weeks later, Garland had no visible bruises or scarring, one of his colleagues with firsthand knowledge said. Garland told investigators he could not remember what happened. He \"has been cooperating with the FBI during his healing process,\" Jeanette Harper, an FBI special agent and spokeswoman for the agency's El Paso office told CNN in December. Border Patrol union spokesman Chris Cabrera had said Garland wants to remember and wants the events of that night out in the open.

Mr. Trump refused to bend on the pact after three days of contentious private debate and  intense lobbying  by other leaders that began Wednesday with an appeal by Pope Francis. The six other nations in the Group of 7 reaffirmed their commitment to cutting greenhouse-gas emissions in a  joint statement  issued Saturday. The stalemate leaves the country\u2019s future role in the climate accord in flux, though Mr. Trump promised to make a decision in the week ahead on whether the United States will be the first of 195 signatories to pull out. Mr. Trump returned home on Saturday night to a White House in crisis after a nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe that was book-ended by new disclosures about links between his aides and Russia. The climate accord was the most vivid sign of division between the United States and its allies, but it was not the only one: Mr. Trump also  scolded Germany  for its trade practices and  lectured NATO members  for not adequately supporting the alliance. \u201cThere was a lot of give-and-take between the different countries in the room,\u201d said Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council. But he insisted that the other countries understood Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to decide now, even if they did not support that position. \u201cThe president\u2019s only been in office for a certain period of time, and they respect that,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re all allies. We\u2019re all trying to get to the right place and be respectful of each other.\u201d While Mr. Trump\u2019s decision was not a surprise, the reaction was swift and critical. Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s continued waffling on whether to stay in or withdraw from the Paris Agreement made it impossible to reach consensus at the Taormina summit on the need for ambitious climate action. But he stands in stark isolation.\u201d The leaders of Germany and France expressed disappointment. \u201cThe whole discussion about climate was very difficult, not to say unsatisfactory,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said. \u201cThere\u2019s a situation where it\u2019s six \u2014 if you count the European Union, seven \u2014 against one.\u201d President Emmanuel Macron of France said he had told Mr. Trump it was \u201cindispensable for the reputation of the United States and for the Americans themselves that the Americans remain committed\u201d to the climate agreement. The G-7 statement provides the United States more time to resolve internal White House debates about whether to pull out of the pact. It says the United States is \u201cin the process of reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics.\u201d The president did not mention the impasse in his only public remarks after the summit meeting, to American troops at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily. But he repeated his complaints about trade and the financing of NATO, even as he pronounced the trip a rousing success. \u201cWe hit a home run no matter where we are,\u201d he said. For Mr. Trump, however, the lack of a decision on the climate accord put an uncertain ending on an ambitious first presidential trip abroad that began as a respite from the surfeit of scandal at home. Beleaguered White House aides \u2014 who were aboard Air Force One flying to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, when they heard reports that Mr. Trump had  called his former F.B.I. director a \u201cnut job\u201d  \u2014 had hoped the trip would offer a much-needed change of subject. And to some degree, it did, if only because the White House engineered the itinerary to keep Mr. Trump far away from reporters who could ask him questions. They scheduled no news conferences and put the president only in highly controlled situations: a brief photo session with a foreign leader; a teleprompter speech; ceremonial gatherings with other leaders. But on Saturday, as his aides tried to promote the trip\u2019s accomplishments, reporters bombarded them with questions about reports that Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, had talked about opening  a secret back channel to Russia  during the transition. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on Jared,\u201d an exasperated Mr. Cohn said. In some ways, it was not one trip, but two, each with very different themes. In  Saudi Arabia  and  Israel , Mr. Trump was surprisingly disciplined, sticking to his script and delivering two speeches that set a clear course for his approach to the Middle East. His rapturous welcome in both countries suggested that the United States could make a new start with allies who had grown restive during the Obama administration. In Europe, however, the pugnacious side of Mr. Trump reasserted itself. In addition to offering a harangue of NATO members over budgetary matters, he declined to explicitly reaffirm America\u2019s commitment to Article 5, which requires the United States to come to the defense of allies in the event of an attack. He also won derisive headlines across the Continent after  muscling aside the prime minister of Montenegro  during a photo shoot, an image that quickly became a metaphor for his rough dealings with Europeans. \u201cHis advisers tried to make him understand that there are some allies that are really nervous and needed reassurance,\u201d said Volker Perthes, the director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. \u201cHe managed to do it with the Saudis and the Israelis.\u201d But in Europe, he said, \u201che does take us for granted.\u201d Brian McKeon, a senior policy official in the Pentagon during the Obama administration, said: \u201cThe in-your-face thing at the NATO headquarters was pretty undiplomatic. He succeeded at busting norms, but not building good will.\u201d The American national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s participation in the ceremony was an implicit endorsement of Article 5. \u201cHe did not make a decision not to say it,\u201d General McMaster said. On climate, Mr. Trump has long railed against what he says are the economic dangers of a global climate pact. He has demanded more flexibility in setting standards on emissions, saying other countries are getting a better deal and that the agreement could be costly for American businesses. In a  message on Twitter  on Saturday, he said, \u201cI will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!\u201d There is an intense debate inside the West Wing over whether to withdraw from the accord or to try to renegotiate its terms, pitting hard-line nationalists, like Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist, against more mainstream advisers like Mr. Cohn. On Thursday, Mr. Cohn told reporters that Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking on the subject was \u201cevolving.\u201d But other senior officials said that even if the United States remained in the agreement, it could effectively gut its principles. The exit of the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China, would not immediately dissolve the pact, which was negotiated under President Barack Obama and legally ratified last year. But it would profoundly weaken the strength of the deal and pave the way for other countries to withdraw from it. Some climate diplomats said the rest of the world was growing weary of America\u2019s back-and-forth on climate change policy. In 1997, the United States joined the world\u2019s first climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, but later withdrew during the Bush administration. \u201cAt some juncture, other countries are going to get sick of us joining in, pulling out, joining in and pulling out and say, \u2018Are we really going to work with the U.S. on this anymore?\u2019\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton. Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, particularly coal-state Republicans, are eager for him to withdraw from the Paris accord, and see such a move as a fulfillment of a signature campaign promise. Speaking to a crowd of oil-rig workers last May, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d the agreement. Coal miners and coal executives in states like Kentucky and West Virginia have pushed hard for Mr. Trump to reverse all of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policies, which are ultimately aimed at reducing the widespread burning of coal. In a recent letter to Mr. Trump from 10 state attorneys general, West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, wrote, \u201cWithdrawing from the Paris Agreement is an important and necessary step toward reversing the harmful energy policies and unlawful overreach of the Obama era.\u201d On trade, Mr. Trump pushed his demand that any agreements negotiated by the United States must be fair. The Trump administration has taken particular aim at Germany, accusing it of depressing the value of the euro to make its exports more competitive and to undercut American goods. In a meeting with leaders of the European Union in Brussels on Thursday, Mr. Trump complained about imports of German cars, threatening to stop them and calling Germany \u201cvery bad\u201d on trade. German officials point out that its two leading luxury automakers, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, have huge assembly plants in the United States. They are also frustrated that Trump officials repeatedly raise the prospect of negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with Germany, something that the country, as a member of the European Union, cannot do. Shortly after Air Force One took off from Sicily for Washington, Mr. Trump  said on Twitter  that he had enjoyed \u201cgreat\u201d meetings on trade, saying, \u201cWe push for the removal of all trade-distorting practices....to foster a truly level playing field.\u201d","articles_date":"27 5 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/05\/27\/world\/europe\/trump-paris-climate-accords-g7.html","articles_title":"Trump Ends Trip Where He Started: At Odds With Allies and Grilled on Russia","candidate_fk":5,"first_name":"Patrick","id":301,"issue":1,"last_name":"Morrisey","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell said in an interview on Friday afternoon that President Trump should rally behind the Senate candidacy of Mitt Romney despite his blistering criticism in 2016, arguing that Mr. Romney\u2019s potent bid was an illustration of the Republican Party\u2019s improving fortunes entering a challenging midterm campaign. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that he\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. McConnell said when asked whether Mr. Trump was comfortable with Mr. Romney, who on Friday  made official his long-expected candidacy  for a Senate seat from Utah. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose the seat, and this looks like a pretty formidable candidate.\u201d Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, said that Mr. Romney would enter the Senate with a stature similar to what Hillary Clinton brought as a junior senator. \u201cThe best way to think about that, and I told him this a couple of months ago, I said: \u2018You\u2019ll be a freshman like Hillary Clinton was,\u2019\u201d Mr. McConnell recalled. \u201cHe will come in here with a level of national identity and respect that will make him effective from Day 1.\u201d His glowing appraisal stood in contrast to that of the White House, which  aggressively lobbied Senator Orrin G. Hatch , the veteran lawmaker who currently holds the Utah seat, to seek an eighth term in large part to block Mr. Romney\u2019s path. Some close to Mr. Trump worry about giving Mr. Romney a platform from which he could run for president again, and Mr. Romney said in remarks Friday night to Utah Republicans that he would not shy away from taking on the president if necessary. \u201cI\u2019m not always with the president on what he might say or do, and if that happens, I\u2019ll call them like I see them, the way I have in the past,\u201d Mr. Romney said at a party dinner in Provo, adding that he largely supports Mr. Trump\u2019s domestic agenda and could work with the White House. While enthusiastic about the handful of Senate candidates, including Mr. Romney, he has helped recruit, Mr. McConnell offered a sober assessment of what the party faces in the first midterm election of Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopular presidency. \u201cThe odds are that we will lose seats in the House and the Senate,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in the 30-minute interview in his Capitol office, adding: \u201cHistory tells you that, the fired-up nature of the political left tells you that. We go into this cleareyed that this is going to be quite a challenging election.\u201d But Republicans have a significant structural advantage as they try to protect  their one-seat majority  in November: They  are defending  just eight seats, while Democrats have to protect 26, including those of two independents who caucus with them. Of the seats Democrats are trying to retain, 10 are in states that Mr. Trump carried in 2016. And after struggling to woo top-tier candidates in some states, Republicans are starting to find more success as they receive a lift from  the tax overhaul  they passed in December. In addition to Mr. Romney, Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, after heavy lobbying by Mr. McConnell and Mr. Trump, reversed himself and said on Friday that he would challenge Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat seeking re-election in a state that the president won by 36 points. Advisers to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, in an indication that he intends to challenge Senator Bill Nelson, a third-term Democrat, have moved to set up a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d according to two Republican officials. And Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, after  saying he would not run again  and  ridiculing Mr. Trump , indicated this past week that  he may not retire after all . Mr. Corker\u2019s public misgivings, however, have complicated the Tennessee race, where Representative Marsha Blackburn, a staunch conservative, was already lining up support, and where Democrats landed a formidable candidate, former Gov. Phil Bredesen. Mr. McConnell, who  is close to Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , an ally of Mr. Corker, was guarded in his comments about the election, but he chuckled when pressed on the incumbent\u2019s apparent change of heart. \u201cIt does underscore that people want to be in the Senate,\u201d he said, trying to make the best of what could become a messy primary contest. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a different environment from late summer, early fall,\u201d when the Republicans were stung by  their failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act . Equally delicate is the fate of Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who at 80 has had a series of health problems and whose seat is being eyed by a hard-line state senator, Chris McDaniel, who nearly beat him in a bitter 2014 primary race. Mr. McConnell called it \u201cpremature\u201d to assess the prospect of a special election this year to replace Mr. Cochran, but did acknowledge that \u201cthere could be\u201d one. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Senator Cochran to make that decision,\u201d he said. Privately, though, Republicans are already scrambling to protect Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat. Party leaders fear that a candidacy by Mr. McDaniel could create a competitive race, and perhaps even spiral into a debacle similar to what happened in Alabama last year, when  Roy S. Moore\u2019s loss  gave the state\u2019s Democrats their first Senate election victory in 25 years. Visiting the White House this past week to help promote Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure proposal, Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi found himself buttonholed by the president, who, citing the Moore disaster, said that Mr. Bryant should appoint himself to Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat should it become vacant, according to a Republican official briefed on the conversation. Mr. McConnell has also privately encouraged Mr. Bryant to take the seat if it becomes available, but the governor has so far resisted the entreaties. Republicans close to Mr. Cochran, who is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, say that while he is not ruling out stepping down this year, he will not contemplate quitting until Congress finishes its 2018 spending bill next month. More broadly, Mr. McConnell said he was open to intervening in some party primary contests, as he did in the Tea Party era, but would do so on a state-by-state basis. He made clear he was supporting  Representative Martha McSally of Arizona , who is running against a pair of immigration hawks  to replace Senator Jeff Flake . And he said he did not want to see Don Blankenship, the former coal mine owner  imprisoned for violating federal mine safety standards , become the party\u2019s standard-bearer against Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia. Mr. McConnell harshly criticized a series of red-state Democrats, but took repeated aim at Mr. Manchin, with whom he has tangled in the past and is plainly eager to beat in a state that has otherwise embraced the Republican Party. \u201cJoe thinks he can just kind of talk his way through all of this, but talk is really cheap when your record doesn\u2019t meet the rhetoric,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, noting Mr. Manchin\u2019s opposition to a series of Republican measures, including the tax bill. Mr. McConnell acknowledged that some of his candidates were struggling to raise money \u2014 \u201cI concede the fund-raising problem,\u201d he said. But he said it was largely the result of having to face so many incumbents, who are typically better able to draw donors. Still, he said that a Supreme Court case, scheduled to be argued on Feb. 26, that is expected to curb the ability of public sector unions to automatically deduct dues from their members could have an impact on Democratic fund-raising. He called the case \u201can example\u201d of why he had found it so important to block former President Barack Obama from replacing Antonin Scalia on the court  after his death in 2016 , a move that Democrats remain bitter about. And, without being prompted, Mr. McConnell said he hoped that the court would broadly address what he described as the left\u2019s effort to outlaw gerrymandering. \u201cWhat do you think the founding fathers had in mind when they gave it to the state legislatures?\u201d he said of redistricting powers. \u201cThey thought it was going to be a political exercise.\u201d While eager to trumpet the tax measure, Mr. McConnell said that \u201cthe single best thing we\u2019ve done, in conjunction with the administration, are the court appointments,\u201d including that of  Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court . And even though he and Mr. Trump  heatedly clashed  over the summer, Mr. McConnell said he had \u201cno complaint\u201d about the president today. Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election, however, will not be Mr. McConnell\u2019s top priority in 2020: The famously competitive senator, who will be 78 at that point, revealed that he is fully committed to running for re-election and chided this reporter for not assuming as much.","articles_date":"17 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/02\/17\/us\/politics\/mitch-mcconnell-midterms.html","articles_title":"Trump Should Get Behind Romney\u2019s Candidacy, McConnell Says","candidate_fk":1,"first_name":"Don","id":302,"issue":8,"last_name":"Blankenship","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. \u2014 President Trump dispensed on Thursday with what he called a \u201cboring\u201d speech on tax reform here, tossing his text to his fans before launching into a lengthy tirade against immigration that included an accusation that Democrats were embracing dangerous policies to secure immigrant votes. Mr. Trump traveled to West Virginia to promote his $1.5 trillion tax overhaul before a friendly audience. But the president grew tired of his prepared remarks after a few moments and returned to the bitter complaints about the United States\u2019 immigration laws that have dominated his attention this week and prompted him on Wednesday to ask governors to deploy the National Guard to the southern border. \u201cThis was going to be my remarks \u2014 it would have taken about two minutes, but what the hell \u2014 that would have been a little boring,\u201d Mr. Trump said, tossing a sheet of paper covered with neat paragraphs of text into the audience. \u201cI\u2019m reading off the first paragraph, I said, \u2018This is boring.\u2019 Come on. We have to tell it like it is.\u201d Instead, he recounted the  terrorist attack  last October  in Lower Manhattan, in which an Uzbek immigrant killed eight people when he drove a truck onto a pedestrian and bicycle path on the West Side Highway. \u201cThis is what the Democrats are doing to you, and they like it because they think they\u2019re going to vote Democrat,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it for that reason, and other reasons.\u201d The president later told reporters aboard Air Force One that he intended to deploy 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard troops to the border with Mexico. If Mr. Trump sends the low end of his proposal, it would barely exceed the 1,200 sent by President Barack Obama in 2010 to support other border agencies. Even if Mr. Trump sends 4,000, the top end of his proposal, he would be dispatching fewer than President George W. Bush did in 2006. In a statement on Thursday, the Pentagon press secretary, Dana White, said that the National Guard troops would focus on engineering, logistical support and vehicle maintenance among other things. The statement did not mention the troops taking part in law enforcement. Republican leaders have urged the president to sell the tax cut that he signed in December, and have tried to make economic growth and low taxes the central theme of 2018 as they move toward a difficult midterm election season. But Mr. Trump has refused to keep to the script. Instead on Thursday, he opted to blast immigrants and the country\u2019s immigration laws, including a practice known as \u201ccatch and release,\u201d in which migrants who present themselves at the border are released from custody to await an immigration hearing to determine whether they should be allowed to remain in the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re toughening up at the border,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe cannot let people enter our country \u2014 we have no idea who they are, what they do, where they came from.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019re murderers, if they\u2019re killers, if they\u2019re MS-13,\u201d Mr. Trump went on. \u201cWe\u2019re throwing them out by the hundreds.\u201d He boasted that he had  described immigrants as rapists when he announced his presidential candidacy , saying that he had recently learned that during the journey north made by a caravan of Honduran migrants, \u201cwomen are raped at levels they\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d Mr. Trump also said his administration had cracked down on MS-13, the transnational gang with links to El Salvador, detailing its brutal methods. \u201cThis is the kind of stuff and crap that we\u2019re allowing into our country, and we can\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He also repeated his false claim that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election. \u201cThey always like to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a conspiracy theory,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNot a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks drew enthusiastic applause from an audience of about 200 in a state that he won with 68 percent of the vote, his largest margin of victory in the country. But it also drew rebukes. \u201cPresident Trump is insulting American voters by making up lies,\u201d said Jason Kander, a former Democratic candidate for the Senate and now the president of Let America Vote, a voting rights group. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s lies cause the American electorate to lose faith in our system of elections and take our elections less seriously, which is one of his goals. If people don\u2019t trust that their vote counts, then they won\u2019t vote.\u201d The round table on taxes was a lovefest for the president, in which attendees took turns praising him and recounting the ways in which the tax measure and Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda had helped them and their families. \u201cThis is a big deal for our family,\u201d Jessica Hodge said, choking back tears after her husband told Mr. Trump that their family had saved $2,417 because of the tax cut. He said they planned to spend it on a kitchen renovation. \u201cThank you for listening to us. Thank you for fighting for us,\u201d she added. The president grinned and nodded his approval. Evan Jenkins, a West Virginia House member, and Patrick Morrisey, the state\u2019s attorney general \u2014 who are competing in a May primary to run for the Senate \u2014 flanked Mr. Trump and took turns showering him with praise. \u201cYou\u2019re a man keeping your promises,\u201d Mr. Jenkins said. \u201cThanks for keeping your promise.\u201d Mr. Morrisey chimed in. \u201cYour policies really have made an incredible difference in our state,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe had the bull\u2019s-eye on us until you got here, so thank you for that.\u201d As he wrapped up the event, Mr. Trump asked the audience to weigh in on which man should win the primary next month. \u201cShould we do a little test?\u201d he said. \u201cWho\u2019s voting for Patrick? Who\u2019s voting for Evan?\u201d The applause was loudest for Mr. Jenkins, who represents the district that White Sulphur Springs is in. Mr. Trump also attacked Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, saying that he had opposed tough immigration laws and the rest of the president\u2019s agenda. \u201cI thought he would be helpful because he talks,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Manchin, a centrist who is known for seeking compromises with Republicans. \u201cBut he votes against everything, and he voted against our tax cuts.\u201d While Mr. Trump spent little time promoting the tax measure he had come to celebrate, he seemed to feed off the adulation of his crowd and relish his detour off-script. Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington, the president asked how the event had gone. Greeted with silence, Mr. Trump answered his own question, saying he was \u201cvery happy.\u201d \u201cThought it was really great,\u201d he added.","articles_date":"5 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/05\/us\/politics\/trump-democrats-immigration-votes.html","articles_title":"Trump Veers From Tax Script to Blast Democrats on Immigration","candidate_fk":4,"first_name":"Joe","id":303,"issue":5,"last_name":"Manchin","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"HOUSTON \u2014  The Republican governors of three southwestern border states on Monday committed 1,600 National Guard members to the U.S.-Mexico border, giving President Donald Trump many of the troops he requested to fight what he's called a crisis of migrant crossings and crime. Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas all made new pledges that add up to almost half of the up to 4,000 troops Trump requested. Some Guard members started arriving at the border as states and the federal government officials continued to discuss what they will do. The only holdout border state was California, led by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, who has not announced whether troops from his state's National Guard will participate. Brown has repeatedly fought with Trump over immigration policy. Under the federal law Trump invoked in his proclamation calling for National Guard troops, governors who send troops retain command and control over their state's Guard members and the U.S. government picks up the cost. Trump said last week he wants to send 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard members to the border, issuing a proclamation citing \"the lawlessness that continues at our southern border.\" \"My administration has no choice but to act,\" he wrote. Administration officials have said that rising numbers of people being caught at the southern border, while in line with seasonal trends in recent years, require an immediate response. Apprehensions are still well below their historical trends during the terms of former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both of whom also deployed the Guard to the border. In Mexico City, a caravan of Central American migrants that had been heading north stopped in the Mexican capital. The caravan had sparked furious criticism from Trump, followed days later by his National Guard border protection deployment plan. Organizers said they never intended to go to the U.S. border. Mexico's foreign relations secretary said his government is evaluating its cooperation with the United States. Luis Videgaray said in a Monday interview with local media that he will give results of the analysis to President Enrique Pena Nieto in coming weeks. The country's Senate passed a resolution last week saying Mexico should suspend cooperation with the U.S. on illegal immigration and drug trafficking in retaliation for Trump's move. But Videgaray said \"no decision has been taken to reduce or suspend any mechanism or cooperation.\" Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey told a group of soldiers preparing to deploy from a Phoenix military base that their \"mission is about providing manpower and resources\" to support agencies on the border and denied that there was a political motive. \"I don't think this is a partisan issue or an identity issue,\" he said. \"You show me somebody who is for drug cartels or human trafficking or this ammunition that's coming over a wide-open and unprotected border here.\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told San Antonio radio station KTSA that he would add about 300 troops a week until the total number reaches at least 1,000 troops. Some Guard members will be armed if they are placed in potential danger, Abbott said, adding he wanted to downplay speculation that \"our National Guard is showing up with military bayonets trying to take on anybody that's coming across the border, because that is not their role.\" There is no end date for the deployment, Abbott said: \"We may be in this for the long haul.\" New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez's office said that more than 80 troops would deploy later this week. They will be the first of an expected 250 Guard members from New Mexico to serve on the border. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, offered to send members of his state's Guard as well. South Carolina sent troops to the border during Operation Jump Start, the border deployment ordered by Bush in 2006. In California, Brown's spokesman, Evan Westrup, said Monday that state officials are still reviewing Trump's troop request. Trump has said he wants to use the military at the border until progress is made on his proposed border wall, which has mostly stalled in Congress. Defense Secretary James Mattis last Friday approved paying for up to 4,000 National Guard personnel from the Pentagon budget through the end of September. Joel Villarreal, the mayor of Rio Grande City in Texas, said he did not agree with what he characterized as \"the militarization of the border.\" \"It's not good for business, to be frank with you,\" Villarreal said. ___ Christie reported from Phoenix.

Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi, during the 2016 presidential election. Trump in January nominated Leandro Rizzuto Jr., a senior executive at Conair, to be the next ambassador to Barbados, as well as to serve concurrently as ambassador to Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, the Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. His nomination requires Senate confirmation. During the height of the Republican presidential primary, Rizzuto spread smears about Trump's opponents, including Cruz, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a CNN KFile review of Rizzuto's Twitter account shows. The revelation that one of Trump's ambassador nominees peddled conspiracy theories comes as dozens of ambassadorships across the globe remain vacant. A CNN analysis shows that 31 ambassador posts are awaiting presidential nominations and 10 nominees are still awaiting Senate confirmation.   Among the unfounded claims Rizzuto promoted were allegations that Cruz was unfaithful to his wife and that Heidi Cruz was a leading member in an effort to combine the governments of the US, Canada and Mexico. A representative for the White House declined to comment. Reached by phone, Rizzuto told CNN that he could not comment based on guidelines from the State Department. All of Rizzuto's tweets on his personal account have been deleted, but retweets dating back to February 2016 are still visible. The Twitter account shares a name with Rizzuto's since-scrubbed Facebook page. The account also follows and is followed by his friends, family members, colleagues and local businesses where Rizzuto lives. In a now-deleted tweet archived through the  Google cache  and the social media site Favstar, Rizzoto told Cruz to \"go back to Canada.\" In another tweet, he called Hillary Clinton \"a terrorist with amnesia.\" Here is a look at Rizzuto's retweets throughout 2016: One tweet Rizzuto retweeted from February 2016 has a picture of Heidi Cruz with a headline that reads, \"This Woman Should Scare the Hell Out of All Americans\" and alleges that \"Heidi is an architect of the North American Union (NAU), whose goal is to destroy the sovereignty of the United States.\" It goes on to say that, \"If Ted becomes US President, it virtually ensures the dissolving of the USA and the formation of the NAU. This would put Heidi Cruz in line to become the First Lady--NOT of the USA, but of the new North American Union\" In March, Rizzuto retweeted a user who shared an image of Mitt Romney that simply has the words \"Dumb Ass\" on it, and the user wrote that Satan had a hold on Romney and that he would go to Hell. The tweet was from the same day that Romney delivered a blistering  speech  critical of Trump. Later in March, he retweeted a person who falsely claimed that Cruz and Kasich were funded by Democratic mega-donor George Soros. Included was a picture of Soros and a caption that said: \"George Soros the leader of their movement worked for Hitler helping kill his own people the jews.\" The false allegation against Soros, who was a child during World War II, is common in fringe, right-wing conspiracy circles. Also in March, Rizzuto retweeted a person who shared a picture of Walker, alleging that Walker had a 2.3 GPA when he was a student at Marquette University, and that he was expelled for cheating. Politifact Wisconsin  reported  the accusations against Walker are untrue. He left Marquette his senior year to pursue a job, and Marquette has repudiated the conspiracy by releasing a statement that Walker \"was a senior in good standing when he voluntarily withdrew.\"   Rizzuto also retweeted an account with an image of golfer Tiger Woods winking with the caption: \"5 Women Ted? My man!\". This tweet came days after the National Enquirer published an article claiming Cruz had affairs with five unnamed women. Cruz vehemently denied the story and accused Trump's campaign of planting the piece. In April, he retweeted an account with an unflattering image of Heidi Cruz\u2014the same image Trump himself shared when he famously threatened to \"spill the beans\" on her\u2014 that said Ted Cruz is a \"Cheater, Liar, & Womanizer\" and Heidi is his partner in crime. The tweet also encouraged people to vote for Trump. Later in April, Rizzuto retweeted another account pushing the National Enquirer's affair allegations against Cruz, alongside a deformed image of Cruz. In September, Rizzuto retweeted a meme that alleged that Clinton's close aide, Huma Abedin, was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and that she was Clinton's handler for the group. The claim that Abedin has ties to, or is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, is unfounded but widespread in far-right circles.

Corey Stewart, a candidate for governor next year and a Trump loyalist in the state, has been let go from his unsalaried, but influential position, according to a Trump campaign source. Stewart had been threatened by multiple campaign aides earlier on Monday when he staged his small demonstration against the RNC for supposedly abandoning his candidate. Stewart shared multiple text messages with CNN from people who claimed to be Trump campaign aides, warning of \"major consequences.\"  \"Do not protest the RNC,\" one text message said, referencing Trump's deputy campaign manager. \"Call Dave Bossie immediately.\" Stewart and a group of about 30 Trump supporters in Virginia were trying to convince the RNC not to abandon Trump in the wake of falling poll numbers and lewd videos that has dismayed many in party leadership. Reached immediately after news emerged on Monday, Stewart, who expected to be fired for demonstrating, said he had not heard of his ouster. But he immediately took shots at people like Bossie. \"I'm loyal to him,\" Stewart said, \"not loyal to political operatives.\" Stewart told CNN the following day he had no regrets over protesting and does not feel betrayed by the Trump campaign. But he did condemn the Republican establishment, promising to \"absolutely\" hold them to account if the GOP is decimated this election cycle. \"Establishment Republicans are undermining the Trump campaign,\" Stewart told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan on \"At This Hour.\" \"There are elements within the campaign who came on board in September and some a little bit earlier than that, that are really part of the Republican establishment and I don't necessarily think they have Mr. Trump's best interests in mind.\" He conceded it would be \"very difficult\" for Trump to win on November 8 without an injection of RNC resources in states like Virginia, adding: \"As a party, you've got to come around the candidate.\" John Whitbeck, the Republican Party's Virginia chairman, called Stewart's firing \"disappointing\" but said he supports the campaign's \"decision to remove their Virginia chairman. With less than a month until Election Day, we can't afford any distractions.\" Trump's support in the GOP has faded in the wake of a 2005 tape that reveals him making lewd and sexually aggressive remarks about women. On Monday, House Speaker Paul Ryan  said he will no longer defend Trump  and instead will focus on preserving his party's hold on Congress, though he did not formally rescind his endorsement. Over the weekend, dozens of fellow Republican lawmakers withdrew their support for Trump, many insisting he should withdraw from the race entirely. The defections came largely from Republican lawmakers facing tough re-election battles, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte. In the House, Rep. Jason Chaffetz said Trump should step aside. But RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, in a conference call with committeemembers early Monday evening, said  nothing will change regarding its relationship to the Trump campaign. The GOP nominee's debate apology was heartfelt, Priebus said.  The RNC  will keep working with the trump campaign as they have been, and nothing has changed. The two entities are in full coordination, Priebus added.

Trump has been trailing Clinton in polls in Virginia for weeks, but a Trump staffer surprised team members in the Old Dominion State with the news on a conference call Wednesday evening with GOP operatives, the Republican National Committee's victory effort and campaign staff.  As the staff was on a conference call ticking off campaign items about door knocks and phone calls, a Trump staffer interrupted by saying, \"You haven't heard the news that we are leaving Virginia?\" according to the operative, who summarized the staffer's comments. \"It was absolutely a broadside,\" the operative said. The campaign is not admitting that Virginia is no longer in play. However, on Thursday, it did release a statement acknowledging that they are pulling staff and resources. \"We remain absolutely committed to winning in Virginia. While we're reallocating some of our staff strategically\u00a0to accommodate early voting\u00a0in nearby priority states\u00a0such as North Carolina, our campaign leadership\u00a0and staffing\u00a0remains strong in Virginia,\" wrote John Ullyot, the deputy political director for communications for the Trump campaign. He confidently continued: \"Together with the RNC and the state party, we will have all the resources we need to re-take the commonwealth at the presidential level in November,\u00a0as historically early voting in Virginia is much less of a focus for both parties than in some other states such as North Carolina.\" Despite the campaign's assurances, Trump's allies in Virginia remain aggravated by the way the Trump Team has handled the news.  According to the GOP operative, John Whitbeck, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, was \"furious\" with the way Trump staffers dumped the news on their Virginia colleagues Wednesday evening.  David D'Onofrio, the communications director for the Virginia state party, declined to comment on the Trump campaign's decision-making. He said that the state party will continue its work. \"We're full steam ahead with our Team Virginia efforts that are working up and down the ticket to make sure that Republicans are getting elected in Virginia,\" D'Onofrio said.\u00a0 The stoppage in Virginia looks to have been a quick decision. Just one day before this announcement, Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, made two stops in Virginia: one in Salem and another in Lynchburg at Liberty University, an  evangelical college led by Jerry Falwell Jr. , a steadfast Trump supporter. On Monday, the Trump campaign  fired its Virginia chair,  Corey Stewart, a candidate for governor next year and a Trump loyalist, after he staged a controversial protest in front of the RNC to convince GOP members and RNC staff to not give up on Trump despite falling poll numbers and the release of a 2005 videotape with Trump making lewd comments. But the Trump campaign has been under pressure for months to give up on Virginia and focus on states like North Carolina, where polls show a tighter race.  As far back as August, the RNC was urging Trump aides to allocated their resources elsewhere, but Trump's son, Eric, vetoed the idea.  \"Eric was one of the driving forces to quash the effort to reallocate out of Virginia back in August,\" the source said.","articles_date":"13 10 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/10\/13\/politics\/donald-trump-campaign-virginia\/index.html","articles_title":"Trump campaign pulls resources out of Virginia","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":307,"issue":8,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) It helps to be a Republican governor on Donald Trump's side. Days after the Trump administration opened the possibility of offshore oil and gas drilling in long restricted areas on both the East and West coasts of the United States, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said that Florida -- the state with the second most coastline in the nation -- would be spared from the new order, handing Gov. Rick Scott a sizeable win ahead of a possible White House-backed Senate run. And it has nearly every other coastal state governor -- Democrats and Republicans -- crying foul, demanding the same treatment. It is unclear whether they will get it. Scott, after all, is a priority for the GOP. Trump and senior aides inside the White House -- both publicly and privately -- have urged Scott to run for Senate, hoping that the Republican governor will challenge Florida Democrat Bill Nelson and possibly help stem a blue wave in 2018. The White House political office has made Scott a key recruit and have urged the President to lean on Scott whenever he can. \"I hope this man right here, Rick Scott, runs for the Senate,\" Trump said while touring hurricane damage last year. In a nod to Scott's standing inside the administration, Zinke even traveled to Florida to discuss the decision with the governor and gave the him almost all of the credit for protecting his state's coastline.  The decision, which came after Scott criticized opening up offshore drilling as bad for his tourism-focused state, has been slammed by environmental groups as politically craven, proof that Trump is \"playing politics\" with his drilling decisions. \"President Trump has directed me to rebuild our offshore oil and gas program in a manner that supports our national energy policy and also takes into consideration the local and state voice,\" Zinke said in a statement. \"I support the governor's position that Florida is unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver. As a result of discussion with Governor Scott and his leadership, I am removing Florida from consideration for any new oil and gas platforms.\" Nelson, Scott's possible opponent in 2018, slammed the maneuver. \"I have spent my entire life fighting to keep oil rigs away from our coasts,\" he said in a statement. \"This is a political stunt orchestrated by the Trump administration to help Rick Scott who has wanted to drill off Florida's coast his entire career.\" Heather Swift, spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said there were no politics involved in the decision to give Florida a waiver from Interior's offshore drilling decision, arguing that any coastal governor can request a meeting with Secretary Zinke. \"There is no 'politics behind' it, it's a very open and public process that actually centers around a series of public comment periods and revisions\u200b,\" Swift said. \"The secretary has said since day one that he is interested in hearing\u200b the local voice. Governor Scott requested a meeting the day the plan was released. If other governors would like to request meetings with the secretary, they are absolutely welcome to do so. As of 10:30 we had requests from NC and SC.\" And White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said Zinke is working to find \"the most responsible and environmentally sound path forward,\" dismissing the idea that politics were behind the decision to except Florida. Governors demand same treatment Zinke's decision has led to extensive complaints by other coastal governors who have already staked out not-in-my-backyard opposition to expanding offshore drilling, often on the same tourism concerns Florida has.  GOP Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire told reporters \"of course\" he opposed drilling off the New Hampshire coast.  South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster -- a vocal Trump supporter -- told reporters in South Carolina on Wednesday that he opposes Trump's offshore drilling plan and will take \"appropriate steps\" to counter it, according to video provided to CNN. \"I am opposed to off shore drilling of South Carolina's shore. I am opposed to seismic testing off of South Carolina shore,\" he said. \"We cannot take a chance with those resources, those industry and that economy. It is just too important. This is a matter of serious importance to us in South Carolina.\" When asked if he will push for a waiver from the Trump administration, McMaster said, \"I will be taking appropriate steps and there will be more news later.\" Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said his administration would use \"any viable legal claims, actions or suits against the US government to prevent.\" A spokesperson for Nathan Deal said the Republican Georgia governor had \"some concerns with opening up Georgia's pristine coastlines which he will convey to the congressional delegation.\" And a spokesperson for Charlie Baker, the popular Republican governor of Massachusetts, said Wednesday that he opposes Trump's plan to allow offshore drilling up the East Coast. Democrats were just as upset. \"New York doesn't want drilling off our coast either. Where do we sign up for a waiver @SecretaryZinke,\"  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted . \"For more than 30 years, our shared coastline has been protected from further federal drilling and we'll do whatever it takes to stop this reckless, short-sighted action,\" California Gov. Jerry Brown, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee -- the three West Coast governors, all Democrats -- said in a statement. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, took to Twitter to rhetorically ask why Florida was treated differently than Virginia in Trump's offshore drilling decision. \"Virginia's governor (and governor-elect) have made this same request, but we have not received the same commitment. Wonder why,\"  Kaine tweeted, referring to two Democratic leaders of the commonwealth. \"We'd like a word in Virginia,\"  Ralph Northam, the state's governor-elect, tweeted  in response to Zinke. And Roy Cooper, the Democratic governor of North Carolina, responded to a Zinke tweet: \"Is this thing on? I'll try again: Not Off Our Coast -- RC\" The only coastal governor -- Democrat or Republican -- seemingly supportive of the plan is Republican Gov. Paul LePage of Maine, whose spokeswoman told CNN on Wednesday that while he has not reviewed all the details of the Interior plan, he \"generally supports efforts to make good use of our indigenous resources and improve the United States' energy independence and security.\" Legal problems? The decision to exempt Florida could also open the Trump administration to legal challenges, allowing states not exempted to complain that the decision is arbitrary because one state was left off the list because Zinke talked with the governor. \"Two days in, the Trump administration has shown us exactly what their offshore drilling proposal is all about and it has nothing to do with listening to local and state voices, economics, or science. This is about playing politics with our coast,\" Sierra Weaver, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said in a statement.  \"If it was anything but that, Secretary Zinke would have announced tonight that he was removing Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, where offshore drilling has already been rejected by local and state voices,\" Weaver added.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.  (CNN) With yet another tragic mass shooting in the books, we've fallen back into a familiar, almost comfortable place in Washington. Both sides, especially on social media, go into their respective corners and essentially do not come out. On the Republican side, we tend to offer thoughts and prayers and not much else. Substantive efforts to solve the problem, whether legislatively or through regulation, are either not discussed or are not followed through. We say \"Now is not the time for politics,\" without saying when that time may come, and what if there is another shooting before that time.  On the Democratic side, there are immediate calls for gun control, while mocking any Republican who offers thoughts and prayers as not only insufficient, but castigating anyone who does not support the Democratic agenda on gun control as being ultimately complicit in an attack. Much of the media echoes the sentiment. Is it any wonder nothing gets done? Having worked in Eric Cantor's majority leader office and, thus, tangentially with the Virginia congressional delegation, I was always struck by the reaction of colleagues whenever the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting was mentioned.  Whether a serious discussion or just a passing reference, the tone in the room always changed. Over time, I learned that it was not merely a pause to remember the victims, but a recognition of the work of so many in the immediate aftermath and how the government response to the Virginia Tech shooting was an example of how to get it right. It was a bipartisan and multilevel effort, with then-Gov. Tim Kaine taking the lead and working with Homeland Secretary Tom Ridge, among others, to bring people together to produce real results. It resulted in legislation -- signed into law by President George W. Bush and supported by both the National Rifle Association and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence -- to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System by expanding the database used for screening gun purchasers.  The Department of Education clarified  the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to better transfer information across agencies and departments. Ten years, later, it's clear these actions -- correct though they were -- are not enough. Perhaps now we should admit that neither side has all the answers, but the other side just might have some. Time and again, a shooter shows warning signs of expressing anger at the world in one form or another. Despite the warnings, another shooter, we're told, \"fell through cracks\" of our warning systems. Clearly, there are too many cracks. Plugging those cracks is doable without a wholesale confiscation of guns. Those who support increased concealed-carry allowances and recognize that declaring a space \"safe\" may send the message that the place is in fact an easy target are not simply doing the bidding of pro-gun organizations.  Many activists seem to mistakenly think that gun control is the only solution for immediate change. Indeed, we can take reasonable, proactive steps to help prevent future attacks, while protecting our Second Amendment rights. These need not be mutually exclusive.  Then-Gov. Kaine, mindful of how politics can quickly surround such a tragedy -- an  even bigger problem today --  issued a stern warning  following the Virginia Tech shooting, \"To those who want to make this into some sort of crusade, I say take this elsewhere.\" Unfortunately, in our politics today, almost everything can become a crusade; witness the language on both sides of immigration debate, for instance. But at a time when loud voices often rule the day, more calm voices, working together to solve this and other challenges surely is a better solution. Perhaps paradoxically, this creates a unique opportunity for President Trump to bridge this divide. He has a credibility with his base that other Republicans do not. He is the only person positioned to garner support for a deal that will simultaneously protect public safety and the Second Amendment.","articles_date":"16 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/15\/opinions\/florida-shooting-opinion-heye\/index.html","articles_title":"Trump is uniquely positioned to cut a deal to prevent school shootings","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":309,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Cambridge Analytica, the data company Donald Trump's campaign hired during the 2016 presidential election, has been under a magnifying glass this week after a whistleblower claimed that the firm  misused the personal data of about 50 million Facebook users .  The firm is partly owned by GOP donor and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer and his family, and has ties to former and current Trump advisers. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is the firm's former vice president, and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway consulted for the company. But Trump isn't the only prominent GOP client to pay for services from the firm. Here are other Republicans who have hired Cambridge Analytica. There have been no allegations of unethical behavior by Cambridge Analytica on behalf of these Republican candidates or groups.  Sen. Thom Tillis and the North Carolina Republican Party Tillis and the North Carolina GOP spent $345,000 for \"microtargeting\" from 2014 through 2015, geared at helping Tillis defeat Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan in 2014, the  most expensive US Senate race in history  at the time. Cambridge Analytica's website  touts  the success of their efforts in the race, saying they \"were able to design and deploy messages tailored to these audiences according to their particular psychographic profiles.\" On Wednesday, Tillis downplayed suggestions his campaign may have benefited from the Facebook breach.  \"I had very limited interaction (with Cambridge Analytica) ... We made it very clear that it's something unethical,\" Tillis said, adding that his campaign team looked into the matter and that the microtargeting was a \"relatively small part of campaign.\" The senator also said he met with Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix once but doesn't remember what they talked about. Nix was  suspended  from his role at the company this week in the wake of undercover reports showing him discussing potential bribery and entrapment. Make America Number 1 Super PAC The Mercer-backed Keep the Promise I\/Make America Number 1 super PAC paid $1,476,484 to Cambridge Analytica from 2015 through 2016. The PAC funded a series of pro-Ted Cruz ads during the 2016 presidential campaign. The PAC was also led by Conway prior to her joining the Trump campaign. John Bolton Super PAC Former US Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton is  being considered  to replace H.R. McMaster as White House national security adviser. According to FEC filings, Bolton's super PAC doled out $1,152,299 for Cambridge Analytica's work from 2014 through 2016. All of the services billed are for \"research\" and \"survey research.\"  Ted Cruz and Ben Carson During their 2016 presidential campaigns, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Dr. Ben Carson solicited Cambridge Analytica for media services, survey research, web services and database management. The Cruz campaign directly spent $5.8 million for the firm's services. In addition, Keep the Promise II super PAC, which is associated with the \"Keep the Promise\" network of the Mercer-backed PACs, was funded by Cruz supporter and Texas billionaire Toby Neugebauer. The PAC paid $570,000 for Cambridge Analytica's services -- the largest expenditure for the PAC during the election cycle. Carson, meanwhile, spent $438,065 for the firm's work.  Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton Cotton paid some $20,000 for Cambridge Analytica's consulting services from 2013 through 2014 as he was campaigning for the Senate.

The President's statement serves as a fresh layer of difficulty for a Senate already struggling to find the bipartisan 60 votes required to advance legislation on any compromise position.  Trump indicated he would reject any temporary extension of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that he is seeking to end next month.  The statement supported a bill introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley and others that includes the President's proposal to grant a pathway to citizenship to the young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children who were covered by DACA, but also includes upwards of $25 billion for border security, hardline immigration enforcement and substantial cuts to legal immigration -- the latter part of which has been uniformly opposed by Democrats and some Republicans.  \"I am asking all senators, in both parties, to support the Grassley bill and to oppose any legislation that fails to fulfill these four pillars -- that includes opposing any short-term 'Band-Aid' approach,\" Trump said.  But the Grassley bill likely doesn't have the backing of 60 votes or even 50, with Republicans like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham opposing the cuts to legal migration and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas signaling he may oppose the pathway to citizenship.  Trump also encouraged a hardline proposal in the House from Reps. Bob Goodlatte and Mike McCaul that goes much further than the Senate proposal and White House framework and likely lacks even enough votes among Republicans to pass the House. It would be dead on arrival in the Senate.  Senators who have pushed for a debate on DACA have known the President is not likely to support a compromise in advance, but have hoped passing something by a wide margin could encourage him to get on board -- which will be necessary for the House to act.  Trump's refusal to consider other bills, at least in advance of something passing, could be a death knell for anything the Senate passes if he does not encourage the House to take it up.  Trump's public comments on immigration have shifted. Last month, he  suggested  that he would sign whatever immigration bill landed on his desk. \"I think my positions are going to be what the people in this room come up with,\" Trump said during a bipartisan meeting with members of Congress at the time. \"If they come to me with things I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it. Because I respect them.\" CNN's Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report.","articles_date":"14 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/14\/politics\/trump-daca-bill\/index.html","articles_title":"Trump issues fresh opposition to short-term DACA bill","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":311,"issue":5,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for a top post\u00a0at the United Nations repeatedly praised far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and shared disparaging memes about prominent Democrats and progressives\u00a0on social media.\u00a0 Patrick\u00a0Murray, a former Army officer and two-time congressional candidate, was\u00a0 nominated  by Trump\u00a0in May to be the\u00a0alternate representative for special political affairs\u00a0to\u00a0the United Nations.

Murray did not return request for comment. The State Department declined to comment. On\u00a0Facebook, Murray praised Yiannopoulos multiple times in 2016, writing comments of approval like  \"Milo rocks,\"   \"preach, Milo!,\"  and\u00a0 \"clone this guy\"  while sharing videos of Yiannopoulos denouncing campus safe spaces, arguing that Britain should leave the European Union to stop Muslim immigration and\u00a0talking about\u00a0the 2016 presidential election. In one of the articles shared by Murray, Yiannopoulos writes about a plan Trump proposed to screen incoming immigrants for their \"commitment to Western values,\" saying, \"The test will apply to all immigrants, yet its obvious target is Muslims, who, as we know, get a bit bomby in the presence of gays, a bit rapey in the presence of women who wear skirts shorter than their ankles and generally a bit hostile and violent around anyone who doesn't have their bum in the air five times a day.\" In one post, Murray defended Yiannopoulos after he was banned from Twitter for harassing\u00a0Saturday Night Live performer and Ghostbusters actress\u00a0Leslie Jones with a barrage\u00a0of\u00a0offensive tweets.

Kennedy \"subject to the receipt of further information.\" Trump's tweet comes as he is staring down an October 26 deadline set in law by Congress mandating the public release of the still-secret documents -- including FBI and CIA files -- barring any action by the President to block the release of certain documents. \"Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,\" Trump said, appearing to leave open the possibility that some documents could still be withheld. A White House official told reporters Saturday: \"The President believes that these documents should be made available in the interests of full transparency unless agencies provide a compelling and clear national security or law enforcement justification otherwise.\" The White House said in a statement to Politico earlier this week that the White House was working \"to ensure that the maximum amount of data can be released to the public\" by next week's deadline. Trump himself is no stranger to the controversies and conspiracy theories that have long swirled around the assassination of the 35th president. During the 2016 campaign, Trump made the unfounded claim that the father of GOP rival Sen. Ted Cruz was associated with Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, a claim he has never reneged nor apologized for. Trump's longtime political adviser Roger Stone, who helped launch Trump's campaign for president, is also an avid conspiracy theorist who wrote a book about the wild claim that President Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's vice president, was involved in Kennedy's assassination. Stone tweeted Saturday morning that he urged Trump to release the classified documents. Republican members of Congress, including Senate judiciary committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, have urged Trump to allow the full release of the documents. \"No reason 2 keep hidden anymore,\" Grassley tweeted earlier this month. \"Time 2 let American ppl + historians draw own conclusions.\" Historians who have studied the assassination do not believe the documents will lead to any bombshell new conclusions in the Kennedy assassination, but the documents could shed more light on facets of the investigation and Oswald's mysterious trip to Mexico City weeks before the assassination. Some have expressed concerns that the documents could be embarrassing to Mexico and damaging to US-Mexico relations. Trump can withhold the release of certain documents if he believes their release could pose harm to US intelligence, law enforcement, the military or US foreign relations. \"There's going to be no smoking gun in there,\" Gerald Posner, the author of \"Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK,\" told CNN's Michael Smerconish. \"But anybody who thinks this is going to turn the case on its head and suddenly show that there were three or four shooters at Dealey Plaza -- it's not the case.\" \"Oswald did it alone,\" Posner continued. \"But what the files are doing and why they're important to come out is they fill in the history of the case and show us how the FBI and CIA repeatedly hid the evidence.\" Posner said that the conspiracy theories about the CIA and mob working together to assassinate a head of state are true -- but the target was Cuban leader Fidel Castro, not Kennedy. \"They tried seven times and they couldn't even wound him. ... They couldn't get rid of Castro, but somehow these same guys who were an 'F' there pulled off the perfect crime in Dallas, and 54 years later we can find not a shred of evidence about it. I just don't buy it,\" he said. Ken Hughes, a presidential researcher at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, told CNN the files could shed light on the US involvement in the attempts to assassinate Castro as well as the US-approved coup of South Vietnamese leader Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in 1963. \"There's a lot for conventional historians -- we non-conspiracy theorists -- to look forward to,\" he said.

The news conference laid bare his unvarnished view of who was to blame for the violence and what he thinks about the nationwide effort to remove statues of Confederate leaders. Trump's comments were the latest in what has been a jaw-dropping saga ever since the President made his first vague statement on the violence, blaming the conflicts on \"many sides.\" The comments also made clear that Trump's speech on Monday -- which vociferously blamed the violence on the \"alt-right\" and neo-Nazi groups who initiated the protest -- was largely a sterilized version of his view. \"I think there is blame on both sides,\"   Trump said during a contentious back-and-forth with reporters in the lobby of his Midtown Manhattan building. RELATED: Heather Heyer died 'fighting for what she believed in' \"What about the 'alt-left' that came charging at, as you say, the 'alt-right,' do they have any semblance of guilt?\" Trump asked. \"What about the fact they came charging with clubs in hands, swinging clubs, do they have any problem? I think they do.\" He added: \"You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. nobody wants to say it, but I will say it right now.\" 'Many sides' On Saturday, as violence in Charlottesville played out on national television, Trump blamed \"many sides\" for the conflict. Though that answer was quickly panned by Democrats and Republicans alike, Trump remained silent on Sunday, leaving it to his aides to try to clean up his vague answer. Trump, after mounting pressure that was palpable inside the White House, spoke Monday and condemned the white supremacists and neo-Nazis at the heart of the violence. On Tuesday, though, Trump defended his 48-hour delay in denouncing white supremacists, arguing that he took his time because he didn't know the facts.  \"I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement,\" Trump said, calling his initial comment a \"fine statement.\"  He added: \"I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement.\" The President subsequently called the driver of the car that drove through a crowd, killing one woman, a \"murderer\" then once again blamed both sides for the violence. CNN Money: Trump says CEOs who quit his council are 'grandstanders' \"You can call it terrorism, you can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want,\" he said. \"The driver of the car is a murderer and what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing.\" \"I didn't wait long. I didn't wait long. I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don't make statements that direct until you know the facts. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don't know the facts and it is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement.\" A senior White House official says chief of staff John Kelly and other top advisers hoped the President would turn a corner Tuesday and talk about infrastructure, but concedes they were entirely wrong. \"That was all him -- this wasn't our plan,\" the official said, speaking confidentially about internal deliberations. The President has been fuming in closed-door meetings about what he sees as unfair coverage and those feelings played out on Tuesday. Some aides gleefully watched as Trump slammed the \"fake news,\" but Kelly stood off to the side as Trump spoke, his face stern and his arms crossed.  Removing Confederate statues Trump also warned against nationwide attempts to remove statues to Confederate leaders, arguing that attempts to remove the statue of Robert E. Lee could lead to attempts to remove monuments honoring former Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.  \"You are changing history, you are changing culture\" by taking down statues to past leaders, he said. Trump said there were some \"very bad people\" on both sides, but that there was some who came out to protest the removal of Robert E. Lee's statue who were \"fine people.\" \"You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down, to them, of a very, very important statue and a renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name,\" Trump said. Pressed by reporters, Trump raised Washington and Jefferson, arguing there could be a slippery slope. \"George Washington was a slave owner. So will George Washington lose his status? Are we going to take down statues to George Washington?\" he said. \"How about Thomas Jefferson, what do you think of Thomas Jefferson, do you like him? OK good. Are we going to take down the statues, because he was a major slave owner? Now are we going to take down his statue?\"  He added: \"You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\" Trump's slippery slope argument is straight out of the 'alt-right' playbook. Corey Stewart, an 'alt-right' leader and the former Republican gubernatorial candidate turned Senate candidate in Virginia, tweeted in response to Trump on Tuesday, \"They won't stop until all of American history is erased.\" Touts winery in Virginia After leaving the podium, Trump was asked whether he planned to go to Charlottesville. His response, \"Does anyone know I own a house in Charlottesville?\"  Trump was referring to his winery in the city.   \"I mean I know a lot about Charlottesville,\" he said. \"Charlottesville is a great place that has been very badly hurt over the last couple of days.\"  He added: \"I own actually one of the largest wineries in the United States, it is in Charlottesville.\" CNN's Jeff Zeleny and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","articles_date":"16 8 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/08\/15\/politics\/trump-charlottesville-delay\/index.html","articles_title":"Trump says both sides to blame amid Charlottesville backlash","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":314,"issue":6,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) A social media post about ballot confusion in Texas has Donald Trump stoking claims of electoral corruption, but local officials say there's not foundation for concern. Meanwhile, in Georgia, a voting machine has been removed from service after complaints that it flipped votes intended for Hillary Clinton to Trump. Some voters in Texas, which began its early voting period this week, have experienced problems casting their ballots. A Randall County voter recalled her own mishap in a Facebook post on Monday, saying that she tried to cast a straight Republican ballot -- including a vote for Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence -- but wound up inadvertently selecting the Democratic ticket of Clinton and Tim Kaine.  As of Thursday morning, the woman's post has been shared nearly 10,000 times and has generated hundreds of comments.  The Republican presidential nominee took to Twitter to suggest Thursday there have been widespread cases of \"vote flipping,\" the act of casting a vote for one candidate only to see it awarded to the opponent instead. \"A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas,\" Trump tweeted. \"People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?\" A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Trump's tweet was a continuation of his oft-invoked claims of a \"rigged\" election, which has emerged as his central campaign message amid eroding poll numbers.  But Shannon Lackey, the elections administrator at Randall County, said there's no reason for concern. \"Absolutely not ... It is not happening in any way, shape or form,\" Lackey told CNN on Thursday. \"I stand 100% behind what I do. I stand behind my machines, my staff.\"  The ballot complaints have surfaced elsewhere in Texas. Another woman said Monday on Facebook that a family member in Arlington, Texas, had her Republican vote changed to Clinton, a post that has been shared more than 200,000 times.  Potter County, which borders Randall County, has encountered similar problems. In each case, officials have attributed the problems to human error. \"There is nothing wrong with any of the machines we use for voting,\" Potter County Judge Nancy Tanner said in a  statement  this week. \"They do not flip your vote. They do not flip parties. Humans do that.\"  Frank Phillips, the elections administrator in Arlington's Tarrant County,  said  that his investigation \"indicated that the voter did not follow the directions for straight-party voting.\"  Randall County uses the Hart Intercivic eSlate for its elections, an electronic system that allows voters to turn a wheel and push a button to indicate preferences, and Lackey said those machines \"work exactly as intended.\"  Moreover, voters are dealt a summary screen at the end of each ballot, which allows them to confirm their choices before casting. Lackey said she is confronted with such confusion most election cycles, and this year has been no exception. Her personal hypothesis is that voters, so accustomed to touch screens in their everyday lives, hit the machine's button after indicating their choices, inadvertently \"deselecting\" their preferred vote. Lackey also pointed out that the Randall County woman behind the viral Facebook post never alleged corruption, and she made it clear that she was able to correct her vote before officially casting the ballot.  \"She didn't use 'flipping' or anything like that in her original post,\" Lackey said. \"I believe that her intention in putting this on Facebook was to say, 'Hey everyone, pay attention.'\"  Georgia machine suspected of 'flipping' votes In Georgia, a voting machine in Bryan County was removed from service after the  Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper reported  to election officials that it may have been \"flipping\" some voters' choices for president. A voter told the newspaper that it took three tries Tuesday before his choice of Clinton was correctly recorded. The voter, who requested anonymity from the paper to discuss his experience, said the touchscreen initially selected Trump. He said his wife had a similar problem on the same machine. Merle King, the executive director for Georgia's Center for Election Systems at Kennesaw State University, told CNN the machine will be evaluated after the election. King said a calibration error may be at fault. If improperly calibrated, the screen could be off 3\/8th to 1\/2 an inch, and other factors -- including whether voters have long fingernails, were wearing jewelry, had long sleeves or were leaning on the machine -- could be responsible as well. The Bryan County Board of Elections said in a statement that all machines were successfully tested ahead of this cycle's elections, and it was not immediately known why the machine in question wasn't initially working. King said the machine in question has been in use in the state since 2002. He added that this particular machine had been used by about 20 other voters on Tuesday, but because of confidentiality rules, it's impossible to say whether other ballots were miscast, though he said no other voters reported problems. King stressed that voters should follow instructions and check their ballot before submitting.

So, are you disappointed in this? \u00a0 COREY STEWART, R-CANDIDATE FOR VIRGINIA GOVERNOR: Well, we have to see what he does. Because when he asked me to be the chairman of his campaign of Virginia, I answered it, yes because it is such an important issue. You know, look, I mean, we talk about these dreamers, 57 percent of them are adults and in Prince William County, one of these so-called dreamers was released by the Obama administration and killed a nun. These aren't just a bunch of innocent people, a bunch of innocent kids that came out and want to make a better life for themselves. A lot of these are adults, they're engaged in criminal activity. They need to be -- and Mr. Trump needs to keep his promise. Sixty three million people took him at his word when he made the promise to rescind this illegal executive order. MACCALLUM: Javier, I would imagine that you are happy with the sort of tempered language here. JAVIER PALOMAREZ, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: \u00a0Well, I think he is illustrating a level of compassionate conservatism that this country needs. Certainly to deport some 11 million people is a burden on American taxpayers. These predominantly are young people who have come here trying to build a life. Many of them have great educations. And they want to contribute to the greatness of this country. I think that for Donald Trump to begin to illustrate that he comprehends the difference between the rhetoric of a campaign and the reality of being president of the greatest nation in the world, illustrate real leadership and I for one am very encouraged by what I've heard. MACCALLUM: So, Charlie, I think back on some of the promises of President Obama, he said he was going to close Gitmo. He said if you liked your doctor, you can keep your doctor. And he is been criticized for not sticking to his word. So, do you criticize Donald Trump for doing the same? CHARLES HURT, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, I mean, certainly what we heard today is a different tone about immigration. But honestly Martha, I don't see any substantive difference between what he said during the campaign and what he is saying now. He is still talking about tearing up the executive order that President Obama signed regarding the dreamers. Not only because it is a terrible policy but because it is unconstitutional. And so that -- he is still going to do that. The question of what to do with the people that are here has been something that, you know, lawmakers have grappled with for 10, 15 ever since 1986, the last time they promised to fix this problem. The real thing that matters most of all is, are you going to fix the problem going forward? And obviously part of that means that you do deport people who are here illegally especially those people who are here illegally and breaking laws in addition to being here illegally. MACCALLUM: Yes. HURT: But I think there is wiggle room for negotiation after that. MACCALLUM: You have to prioritize. And I think that's what he's talked about quite a bit. So, Corey, I want to go back to you on this. Because he said, basically you want to build a wall. So you want to, you know, put a stopper in the opening of that is allowing people to flow through. Then you want to get rid of the criminals first, he said. So, that's going to take a while to achieve those two goals. And then and only then do you move on to the next category of people, right, Corey? STEWART: Well, I would agree with that prioritization. And it certainly makes sense, you know, secure the border, go after the criminals first. \u00a0I'm completely, you know, that's what we did in Prince William County to great effect. But you know, one of the things that has to be done here, is we have to establish law and order in our immigration system. If we don't enforce the law, the law that Congress and the President created, not the President alone, then what's the point of even reforming the law if we're not going to enforce it? MACCALLUM: Yes. STEWART: And that the first thing that Trump needs to make good on the promise. That's the most important thing. He needs do what Reagan did when, you know, by firing the air traffic controllers 35 years ago. He needs to establish that he is serious, he is going to keep his promises and that, you know, if you dealt that, he is going to make it very clear at very beginning of his administration that instead of breaking promises, he is going to keep them. MACCALLUM: You know, Javier, it seems that Donald Trump as many presidents do, they've sort of start with the pendulum all the wait to one side. They want to make a very clear point during the campaign. And they want to make it clear to people that they are serious about it. Then they have to start to move towards the ability to actually take action on it. But, you know, in terms of Corey's point, we have laws in this country. You are not allowed to be here illegally. And it does seems sometimes like there are different laws for certain immigrants crossing the border and different laws for others who seemed to get kicked out and have to stay away for years and work their way back in. So, why isn't the same for everyone? PALOMAREZ: Listen, what I can tell you is that in my conversations with the Trump team, I have witnessed them illustrate a real willingness to comprehend the issue in its broadest context. We have tried to insure that they understand the important economic and commercial implications to this thorny and often emotional issue called immigration reform. At the end of the day, these people are predominantly employed, predominantly working in this country to deport them in a mass fashion would cost anywhere from 300 to $400 billion to the American economy. And I'm glad that the issue was brought up about Ronald Reagan. Because you will recall that Ronald Reagan basically pardoned millions of people at the time that he was president and that he illustrated that we are a country of broad shoulders and big hearts. It is time that Donald Trump did that. I'm very encouraged by the fact that he is willing to at least stop and pump the brakes just a little bit and look at this thing for what it truly is. MACCALLUM: Well, he's going to have to walk a fine line. HURT: And amnesty, those three million turned into 12 million plus. MACCALLUM: Yes. HURT: And that's why it has to be done. Border security first this time. MACCALLUM: Great point. STEWART: I agree. MACCALLUM: All right. Gentlemen, thank you very much. Good to see you all tonight. Another major announcement today for the President-elect's cabinet as we learned retired Marine General John Kelly is being tapped to run the Department of Homeland Security. There were number of people that were considered for that spot. From what we know, the President suggesting tonight that the Intel community failed to alert him about the rise of ISIS. Is that true? Our own Oliver North claims that it is either an outright falsehood or criminal negligence. We're going to talk to veterans Carl Higbie and Larry Korb about how that could have happened and how President-elect Trump may handle things differently. Also, Chris Stirewalt is here tonight on President-elect Trump's honeymoon period in the polls. We're going to show you the brand-new numbers, next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: The script to what we're doing is not yet written. Remember, this has been a great, great movement. The likes of which they've never seen before. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight. Another big announcement from the President- elect today, as we learned that retired Marine General John Kelly is the man who is tapped to the run the Department of Homeland Security. It is a big job. And while there is some major pressure in that post with both immigration as we just talked about. And also counterterrorism on the line, so is he the right man for the job? Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge joins us live this evening from Washington. Catherine? CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Martha, in his last job, General Kelly's portfolio included Guantanamo Bay immigration and drug trafficking. Those close to Kelly say, that experience makes him well versed on Southern border issues. And when he retired in January, Kelly seemed to check another Trump box emphasizing his work with intelligence and Homeland Security outside the beltway. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. JOHN KELLY (RET.), UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS: At least it's been my experience, the further you get away from Washington the better things work. People actually talk to each other, people actually socialize with each other, they work together. There is no rice bowls. (END VIDEO CLIP) HERRIDGE: General Kelly is widely respected and understands the human cost of war. In 2010 his son Lieutenant Robert M. Kelly was killed in Afghanistan by an IED. Kelly rarely speaks about the losses but when he does, he addresses the importance of finishing the mission for fellow Gold Star families. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KELLY: I think the one thing they would ask is that the cause for which their son or daughter fell be carried through to a successful end, whatever that means. As opposed to this is getting too costly or too much of a pain in the ass and let's just walk away from it. Because that's when they start thinking it might have been not worth it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HERRIDGE: The new secretary will take over the sprawling department of 240,000 government employees at a time the terror threat has never been broader, wider or deeper. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICK RASMUSSEN, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM DIRECTOR: There exists a greater number of potential terrorist actors who aspire to do us harm than at any point in our history since 9\/11. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For eight years the Obama administration reluctantly played global whack-a-mole with Jihadists rather than leaning into the fight with decisive leadership. (END VIDEO CLIP) HERRIDGE: Based on government data ISIS was operating in seven countries two years ago and this year that number has nearly tripled to 18 -- Martha. MACCALLUM: Catherine, thank you. HERRIDGE: You're welcome. MACCALLUM: So, while ISIS represents a clear and present danger for the incoming administration, President Obama suggesting tonight in a brand new interview that his intelligence community let him down when it came to warning him accurately about the threat. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: The ability of ISIL to initiate major land offenses, that was not on my intelligence radar screen. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Really? Because here's what some of his own intelligence officials were telling Congress in the months and weeks after the first major ISIS victory in Fallujah. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Syria has become a huge magnet for extremists and we're seeing now the appearance of training complexes in Syria, to train people to go back to their countries and of course, conduct more terrorist acts. \u00a0So, this is a huge concern to all of us. JOHN BRENNAN, DIRECTOR, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: We are concerned about the use of Syrian territory by the al Qaeda organization to recruit individuals and develop the capability to be able to not just carry out attacks inside of Syria but also to use Syria as a launching pad. BRETT MCGURK, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY, GLOBAL COALITION TO COUNTER ISIL: \u00a0Its current leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is a designated global terrorist under U.S. law and we believe is currently based in Syria. His mission is clearly stated in his own statements, is to carve out his own governing territory from Baghdad through Syria to Lebanon. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, the scale of what they are involved in right now, particularly the al Qaeda element in Iraq, and just the level of destruction that they are having and the level of killing that they are doing inside of that country is just -- is terrible. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So those were in January and February of 2014. Right around the time that the President called ISIS or ISIL, the jayvee team. Carl Higbie is a former Navy SEAL and a Trump supporter. Larry Korb is senior fellow with the Center for American Progress and a former assistant Defense Secretary. Gentlemen, thank you very much. CARL HIGBIE, FORMER NAVY SEAL AND TRUMP SUPPORTER: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Good to have all of you here. You know, when you look at it in that context, Carl, why would the President say in an interview that is happening now as he is about to leave office, that his intelligence people were not giving him the full picture? HIGBIE: That's a fundamental lie. Barack Obama's foreign policy has been a complete disaster. He knows darn well that this intelligence committee told them that. And any general that told him that ISIS is going to be a problem, he fired them. That way he wouldn't have to listen to them. And all people who didn't speak out for the ones that stuck around, you know, that he didn't get rid of. So, when he says that he didn't hear about this from the intelligence community, that's malarkey. I know for a fact guys like General Flynn told him that this was going to be an issue. MACCALLUM: Yes. General Flynn who won't be new head of the National Security Council was pretty much screaming this from the rafters, Larry, at that point and after. Because he felt that he wasn't being listened to. \u00a0But he wasn't alone at all. There were plenty of intelligence officials who also said they were filing reports that they thought that were being told to sort of -- to dumb them down a bit because the message wasn't what the White House wanted to hear, Larry. LARRY KORB, SENIOR FELLOW, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: I think if you go back and you just play part of General Clapper's testimony, he said in the summer of 2014 that he underestimated how strong they would get in Syria and the collapse of the Iraqi army. President Obama was already fly -- having Americans flying missions back there in 2013. And Admiral Rogers, the head of NSA who is one of the people that trump is considering to replace General Clapper, he said we underestimated them. That's what Obama was trying to say. People knew they were there but they underestimated how quickly they would be able to get into Iraq and the Iraqi army would collapse. I think that's exactly what he's saying. And again, you know, intelligence people make mistakes. General Flynn was blaming Benghazi on Iran, which wasn't true. MACCALLUM: Larry, they do make mistakes. But I guess, what some people will take issue is in watching this interview, is why wouldn't the President say at this point, you know what, upon reflection there were people who were speaking out very strongly on this matter, and it would have been wise to have paid attention to them. You get a lot of information incoming. And I chose to, you know, follow some people's take on whether or not they could be contained. But this is a period during which people were being beheaded. Mass beheadings on the beach. People were being drowned in cages. And we were being told, Carl, essentially that, you know, this is just sort of an out of control group that really couldn't establish any territory that would be meaningful to anybody. HIGBIE: Well, Martha, Barack Obama won't say any of that because he is so profoundly arrogant when it comes to his foreign policy. He has no understanding of what went wrong and he doesn't care to understand because he has his agenda. And he doesn't care too is that I was there in 2009 and I put this in my first book that this was going to be a problem. We were pulling out of Iraq. There was power vacuums happening. The violence was escalating and they didn't want to admit that. So what they did was they stopped all American troop direct action mission. So, we weren't allowed to go kill bad guys which is what we are trained to do as soldiers. And then they claimed victory. Well, the enemy get to say whether or not the war is over and they were saying it wasn't over and we just pulled out anyway. MACCALLUM: Larry, last word? KORB: Wait! Wait a second. President Bush signed an agreement that said, we had to get out by the end of 2011 and we had to, in early 2009 stop our combat missions. This was not Obama who did that. And General Petraeus -- HIGBIE: But Obama didn't try to change it. KORB: Yes. But General Petraeus said even if you had left 10,000 troops there he doesn't think it would have made any difference. Because it was malarkey the way he ran the place and he wouldn't allow our troops to stay there without a status of forces agreement. MACCALLUM: A lot of people believe that that status of forces agreement could have been reached. And President Bush himself actually warned about leaving a vacuum in that area and he said that terrorist elements would fill that vacuum if it was left. So, you know, I guess my point is that when you have 2020 and you have the hindsight on it, what would behoove a president or any leader would be to be as clear-eyed as possible in explaining what happened so that the next president could see it in a way that might be more helpful to him instead of perhaps throwing people under the bus that don't deserve it. So, Larry, thank you very much. Carl Higbie, very good to have you with us tonight as well. HIGBIE: Thanks, Martha. MACCALLUM: Thank you, gentlemen. So coming up, Ohio could be on its way to passing one of the strictest abortion laws in this country. It is known as the heartbeat bill. And it is sitting on Governor John Kasich's desk. We will debate that bill and the fallout ahead. Plus, a stunning new poll numbers tonight with respect to President-elect Donald Trump's popularity and how people feel about the country today. Chris Stirewalt here to explain what is behind the Trump bump. And whether the surge can last. When we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Developing tonight, a surge in polling for a President-elect Donald Trump as he rides the tailwinds of his surprising November victory. \u00a0Mr. Trump appears to be experiencing a bit of an extended honeymoon phase with the American public when it comes to his popularity. A new Bloomberg poll out today shows that he is at 50 percent. Marking a 17-point jump since August. What is more the same poll found that percent of American adults who believe that the country is on the right track is now in its highest place in four years. So what's contributing to these jumps and can it last? Probably not. Most of these things go up and down. Right? Our FOX News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt is here to explain tonight. So, Chris, very nice move. Is this normally what we see with a President-elect? CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, it depends on how you're rolling when you get there. In Donald Trump's case he may have squeaked over the finish line to a certain degree but he has gotten a -- the honeymoon is more pronounced for him. Barack Obama came into office popular. He went into election Day fairly popular eight years ago. This time Donald Trump was lugging what looked like overwhelming negatives. \u00a0People were very down on him. You remember a month ago, it was just a month and a day ago that we had the election. A month ago and three weeks ago people were saying should Donald Trump be normalized? Should -- and critics said should the president have even welcomed him to the White House and all this stuff. A month later, you know, we're saying, well, half the country says they feel pretty good about him. And, by the way, on his core policy sets, people are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. So Trump definitely has changed the landscape around him. MCCALLUM: He always said that he could be presidential. And, you know, I remember even Paul Manafort who, you know, had a short stay in the Trump campaign said, well, he, you know, let's start out on the edges then he'll kind of move his way to the middle. You've got Al Gore and Rob Emmanuel coming to meet with Donald Trump. STIREWALT: That's right. MACCALLUM: And, you know, Kellyanne Conway said that President Obama and Donald Trump have spent 30 hours on the phone together. STIREWALT: That's a lot of hours. MACCALLUM: Is that possible? STIREWALT: That's a lot of hours. MACCALLUM: I haven't spent 30 hours on the phone since eighth grade. So, I don't know what they're talking about, Chris, but they have a lot to talk about. STIREWALT: And I can picture they're twisting the cord around your finger and talking to your friends. I know. I would say that what part of Donald Trump was benefiting from is that there was a caricature of him that certainly that his political opponents, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats laid out there, but also there was in the press. He's a Nazi, he's a monster. He's evil. He is going to drink the blood of the children of America, run and hide. He's the crampiest. And then he showed up and went, oh, he's kind of funny. I think I like him. MACCALLUM: So you start there. STIREWALT: Right. MACCALLUM: You can only go up. STIREWALT: That's right. And he's being moderate, and he's making these cooing noises that liberals like, even though he's appointing people that are really conservative. MACCALLUM: Fascinating. Chris, thank you very much. STIREWALT: You bet. MACCALLUM: Always good to see you, sir. Come see us in the morning. All Right. So, let's be joined now by Republican congressman Sean Duffy, and Richard Fowler of Fox News contributor and national syndicated radio talk show host. Welcome, gentlemen. Hello, there. Good to have you all here. So, Richard, I know -- you were smiling broadly as Chris and I were talking. \u00a0What do you think about all that? RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think there's some truth to what Chris is saying here. I think every president gets a honeymoon phase after they win. The American people are looking for him to provide answers, and to create jobs, and to build this wall, and all these other things. And so, I think, that's what we're going to wait and see what happens. Now, I think Donald Trump has a couple of problems. I think problem number one is that as he gets into his first 100 days he's going to want to pass this trillion dollar transportation or infrastructure bill, which I think is a great idea if done correctly. And I think budget hawk like Congressman Duffy and others will be like, oh, trillion dollars, too much, we need to lower that number. And that's where you're going to see the big eruption that will be Trump taking on his own party. MACCALLUM: Well, Representative Duffy, I thought it was interesting in the interview that Donald Trump did today, he said, I would like to be judge on my presidency starting now. Starting when I got elected because the Dow is at an all-time high, I mean the market has responded incredibly positively, so far to the Trump transition, part of this process. But if he comes forward with that bill, are you going to give him hard time about how to pay for it? REP. SEAN DUFFY, R-WIS.: Well, it depends. If he doesn't pay for it, we'll obviously have trouble with it. But there's great pain for us, I mean, we can repatriate foreign profits back to the states, whether we charge five, eight, 10 percent interest. You can pay about 3 or $400 billion of that trillion dollar expenditure. But, listen, Martha, we're trillion dollars in debt. To think that we're going to add another trillion of unpaid spending on top of it, that's not going to happen. But what's interesting is liberals across America, like, maybe a little bit of Richard, their hair is on fire. They're pulling out. They can't believe the evil Donald Trump is actually, you know, warming up to the American people, and they kind of like him. They want to give him a shot. But what's interesting is -- just one second, only 28 percent of Americans want Democrats to oppose Donald Trump, and Republicans in congress, they actually want them to work with us to secure the border, fix healthcare, and grow the economy, which is really remarkable for Democrats to have this push on their own side and say work together and get some of these big initiatives done. MACCALLUM: I find it fascinating. This is really what I think is the most interesting. So, Richard, tell me, you know, do you believe -- are you willing to give Donald Trump a chance? I mean, the people were sobbing and devastated after this election in, you know, half of the country, essentially, right? Are they starting to feel better or do they think this is not real? FOWLER: Well, listen. I respect the presidency of the United States, the person in it, that's another story, depending upon who it is every four areas. But here's the thing, I think the American people they were angry, and they were frustrated. They felt the economy was rigged. I think millennials especially felt that going into November -- going into last month as Chris Stirewalt said, and now Donald Trump has to prove that he can really quote, unquote, make America great again. And like Congressman Duffy pointed out, he's going to have some trouble in his own caucus making that a reality. The same thing that he's proposing, the same thing Barack Obama proposed 8 years ago, a trillion dollars infrastructure bill, and Republicans blocked it tooth and nail, and he's just indicated they're going to do it again. (CROSSTALK) \u00a0 MACCALLUM: You have to come to it with a way it pay for it. FOWLER: You have it right here. DUFFY: Richard, remember, there was this $800 billion spending bill under Barack Obama, and they said there were shovel-ready jobs and there weren't no shovel-ready jobs. (CROSSTALK) \u00a0FOWLER: That's not true, congressman. DUFFY: You've got nothing. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Quickly, before we go because I'm pretty much out of time, you know, what's the best way to pay for it, quickly? DUFFY: Repatriate profits up from overseas. Best way -- but we're going to do heath care, we're going to do the border, a lot of issues that Americans have bought into. This is one issue that we'll get too. FOWLER: Big battle with Trump and the party, Martha. Big battle. MACCALLUM: You know what I would say? Actions speak louder than words. \u00a0So we'll see what happens. And if he makes good on those promises, and then he will make good on them. FOWLER: I hope so, Martha. I hope he does. MACCALLUM: OK. Richard, thank you very much. FOWLER: Thank you, Martha. MACCALLUM: Sean Duffy, great to see you both. So there's a controversy brewing in Ohio, as the state is on the verge of adopting one of the most strict abortion laws that would exist in this country. Lisa Booth and Nomiki Konst will discuss it. It is called the heart beat bill, coming up. Plus, today, we remember the day that lives in infamy. It has been 75 years since the attack on Pearl Harbor, our interviews with heroes who survived coming up. You don't want to miss it, very special. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 UNINDENTIFIED MALE: The fact I was setting up machine guns, second time I was firing at enemy planes passing by, and survived that day. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight at this hour, the state of Ohio is now just a signature away from a historical prolife legislation. Governor John Kasich is now tasked with considering the adoption of one of the strictest abortion laws in the country. It is a measure that would ban abortions upon the first heart beats of the fetus, heart beats that are often measured in just six weeks into a woman's pregnancy. Fox's Shannon Bream has the details on this story for us tonight from Washington. Shannon? SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS: Martha, advocates on both sides of the abortion debate are watching and waiting to see what Ohio governor and one time presidential candidate John Kasich will do with the so-called heart beat bill, just passed by lawmakers there. The bill bans anyone from performing an abortion without first checking for a fetal heartbeat, or from continuing with an abortion if a heartbeat is detected. Roughly around six weeks into a pregnancy. A doctor who breaks the law could be convicted of a felony and face up to a year in prison. The bill contains an exception if the mother's life is in danger, but there are no exceptions in cases of rape or incest. Meanwhile, Pro-choice Ohio's executive director says, quote, one in three women choose to have an abortion in their lifetime, making women from getting a medical procedure is out of touch with Ohio values and is completely unacceptable. She continues, clearly this bill's supporters are hoping that President-elect Trump will have the chance to pack the U.S. Supreme Court with justices that are poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. We must prevent that from happening to protect women's lives. So far, no word from the governor, although, pro-life, Kasich had express concerns about the legal viability of earlier version of the bill. Similar laws have been struck down in Arkansas and North Dakota, and now the clock is ticking in Ohio. If Kasich signs the bill or does nothing within ten days, it will become law early in 2017. If he veto the measure, that is the end. And last 3\/5 of the state house and senate vote to override his veto. Multiple groups including ACLU have vowed to immediately sue if the law does go into effect. Martha? MACCALLUM: Our thanks to Shannon Bream. So, here with more, Lisa Booth is a Washington Examiner columnist and a Fox News contributor. Nomiki Konst is host of The Filter on Sirius XM Progress. Welcome to both of you. Good to have you here tonight. UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi, Martha. MACCALLUM: A lot of pressure right now on John Kasich. This bill is sitting on his desk, and obviously a lot of pro-life advocates would like to see him sign it. But as Shannon pointed out in the past, Kasich has said that he's pro-life, but he believes in exceptions for rape and insist which do not exist in this bill. Nomiki, what do you think happens here? \u00a0What do you think should happen? NOMIKI KONST, THE FILTER HOST: Well, number one, I think that this bill is just flat-out unconstitutional. Similar bills have been struck down in upper courts in North Dakota and Arkansas. I think it will be bad politics for John Kasich. I think it's bad politics for Donald Trump. Donald Trump has a lot of things on his desk right now. He needs easy wins. This is a way to unify the left. Unify moderate Republicans who know that this is bad politics. And furthermore, it's just dangerous. Most women don't know they're pregnant by five or six weeks. Most women -- it doesn't stop abortions. It forces a woman to get an abortion in dangerous place and we know that. I mean, there's history to prove that. So, you know, if abortion-right activists are unified in an effort like this, I think that they have a clear path to victory. And I think John Kasich's history shows that he's even against bills like this, which do not exclude women who have experienced rape or incest. MACCALLUM: All right, Lisa, what do you think? LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, look, I don't think it's as controversial as the media and the left purports it to be. Columbus dispatch and Quinnipiac did polling in 2013, and found that voters were actually split 46\/47 on it. So it's not as controversial as, you know, Nomiki just purported to be. But, you will agree with her notion in a sense that North Dakota did have similar legislation that was struck down on Federal court, and the Supreme Court refused the state appeal to hear it, so, ultimately, will likely meet the same fate. But I think what is important here is the movement on the pro- life community, and feeling emboldened under President-elect Donald Trump. If you look at what's happening across the street, there is more pro-life legislation pass in the state level in recent time, and they're only going to get emboldened when Republicans hold more state legislators than ever before in history. And majority of governors in the country are Republicans. And you've also have a president-elect who is committed to things like nominating pro-life Supreme Court justices. Also another important thing, real quick, Martha, is the fact that there is another bill on Governor John Kasich's desk, which he will sign which will make Ohio the 18th state to support banning abortions at 20 weeks, which is something the majority of Americans support. And something that Hillary Clinton did not support. She wants abortions at 20 weeks, which is extreme. MACCALLUM: Yeah. Forty three states have some or all abortions after a certain point illegal. And as you point out, that other law would make Ohio the 20th state in terms of the 20-week law. And, you know, we look across the numbers Nomiki, 47 percent of the country according to gallop is pro-choice, 46percent is pro-life. I think these numbers have been changing over the course of the last several years, especially with new technology that does show things like a heartbeat at such an early stage of the game.

You know, the ceremonies are still under way here in Pearl Harbor, including directly behind me at the USS Arizona Memorial, which of course is the grave site to some 1,177 sailors and marines. Other Arizona survivors who died later are also in toured there, but today two more sailors on the Arizona, who died this year will have their ashes placed inside the wreckage. In essence, they'll be joining their band of brothers. And for one of them, who will actually join his real brother because his twin was also on board the Arizona, 75 years ago, and was killed by the Japanese. So now, there are five survivors left of the U.S. Arizona, and four of them were at Pearl Harbor today. They were all asked how it is they were able to get off the burning ship. Watch.

And he tied the heavy line and we pulled out across, and proceed to go hand over hand across the vessel about 70 or 80 feet. I don't know how I made it, but I'm here. (INAUDIBLE) GALLAGHER: So they fled the attack, but they came back to fight the fight. \u00a0And during his keynote speech today, Admiral Harry Harris, who is the top U.S. commander of the Pacific fleet made it very clear that those men were in fact heroes.

Instead, they became the main event. Minutes after taking the stage, Trump went after the state's Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, for voting against the GOP tax reform bill and urged voters to vote him out of office. \"I thought he would be helpful because he talks,\" Trump said of Manchin. \"But he votes against everything. And he voted against our tax cuts.\" Next, he blamed Democrats -- once again name-checking Manchin -- for what he deemed to be the United States' \"very weak\" immigration laws, slamming family-based immigration and calling for the end of \"catch and release\" policies. He even revived his unsubstantiated claim that \"millions and millions\" of people voted illegally in the 2016 election, in which he won the presidency but lost the popular vote. \"In many places the same person in California votes many times,\" Trump said Thursday. \"They always like to say, 'Oh that's a conspiracy theory.' It's not a conspiracy theory. Millions and millions of people, and it's very hard because the state guards their records.\" The topic Trump was slated to focus on -- tax reform -- would have been lost on the West Virginia audience due to his lack of focus. But the panelists sitting alongside Trump at the roundtable event -- a medley of local business executives, employees and regular families -- accomplished the White House's goals, sharing personal stories of tax savings, bonuses and raises they attributed to the GOP tax law. \"Thank you for listening to us, thank you for fighting for us, thank you for caring enough,\" said Jessica Hodge, a business administrator, as she broke into tears. Previewing the event, a senior White House official told CNN that Trump would focus on the tax reform proposals, which Republicans hope to make central to their efforts to hold onto their majorities in Congress. The official said Trump would likely target Manchin, but declined to say whether Trump would call him out by name. Ultimately, Trump called Manchin out several times -- first over the tax reform bill, then over his opposition to an Obamacare repeal bill and even over \"other things we don't like.\" Trump's remarks at a roundtable touting his tax reform law came as he sat in between two of Manchin's would-be Republican opponents for the 2018 Senate election, GOP Rep. Evan Jenkins and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Trump pointed out that the state's voters will soon \"get a chance to get a senator\" who will support his agenda. Similar to an Ohio event last week, the roundtable was billed as an official White House event -- not a campaign event -- but Trump spent most of his time talking about electoral politics and repeatedly railed against Manchin, a Democrat who has supported some of the President's initiatives -- though not the biggest-ticket items. Trump has been increasingly turning his focus to the 2018 midterm elections as Republicans look to keep their majority in Congress. Key to those efforts will be the roundtable-style events like the one Trump is holding in West Virginia, the senior White House official said, as Republicans look to focus their campaign messaging on the economic benefits of the tax law. The event gave prominent screen time to two of the Republicans vying to unseat Manchin, but left out another top contender for the GOP nod -- the controversial coal mining executive Don Blankenship, who was released from prison just last year. Even after the roundtable participants finished talking about the benefits of the tax reform legislation, it was clear Trump wasn't quite done talking about the 2018 midterms. \"Should we do a little test?\" Trump asked the audience, while he sat sandwiched on stage between Morrisey and Jenkins. \"Who's voting for Patrick?\" Trump said, drawing modest applause for Morrisey, the state's attorney general. Next up was Jenkins. \"Who's voting for Evan?\" Trump asked, drawing noticeably louder applause and whoops from the crowd. Sensing the gap, Morissey leaned into the President and offered a point of order: \"It's his congressional district!\"","articles_date":"5 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/05\/politics\/donald-trump-west-virginia-tax-reform\/index.html","articles_title":"Trump targets Democratic senator in free-wheeling West Virginia event","candidate_fk":5,"first_name":"Patrick","id":317,"issue":6,"last_name":"Morrisey","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump, as  part of his dash to rack up wins  before the end of his first 100 days, signed an executive order Thursday that creates a new office devoted to protecting whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Before signing the order at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Trump said the new office will help provide veterans with the \"health care they need and the health care they deserve.\" \"We are not going to let them down,\" Trump said, arguing that the order \"makes it clear that we will never tolerate substandard care for our great veterans\" and ensure that those who report problems at the veterans affairs are protected. Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin told reporters Wednesday that the office will review all VA employees and protect those who find employees within the agency who \"have deviated\" from the mission of serving veterans. The new office comes after years of controversy in how the Department of Veterans Affairs was caring for the country's veterans and will work in concert with efforts already in place within the government, including an office that reviews the actions of senior executives inside the department and a White House hotline for veteran complaints. The order, Shulkin said, allows the department to \"identify barriers that are preventing us from moving employees and people that we have identified that should no longer be working at VA.\" A White House official told CNN that the office will \"discipline or terminate VA managers or employees who fail to carry out their duties in helping our veterans.\" The  Department of Veterans Affairs has been plagued by issues for years , leaving many veterans without the care they need after coming home from war. A 2014 report found more than 1,000 veterans may have died in the last decade because of malpractice or lack of care from VA medical centers. But the problems have persisted to the point that lawmakers have argued people inside the VA medical centers and the department headquarters in Washington didn't seem to care. \"I was very frustrated when it became obvious to me how bad the problem was and how little support we had within the leadership of the VA to transform El Paso,\" Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat, told CNN in 2016. Trump promised reform earlier this year in a meeting with the leaders of prominent veteran groups. \"As commander in chief, I will not accept substandard service for our great veterans,\" he said. And during the campaign, Trump pledged action to reform the VA. Trump called the department the \"most corrupt\" and \"most incompetently run agency in the United States\" during the 2016 campaign when he released a 10-point reform plan for the department. CNN's Scott Bronstein, Curt Devine and Drew Griffin contributed to this report.","articles_date":"27 4 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/27\/politics\/trump-veterans-affairs-whistleblower\/index.html","articles_title":"Trump to create new whistleblower protection office at Veterans Affairs","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":318,"issue":6,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) The chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in Virginia argued that Hillary Clinton is to blame for \"essentially encouraging the murder\" of five Dallas officers who were shot to death Thursday night. Corey Stewart, a Republican who is running for governor, posted on his Facebook page that Clinton and Virginia Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam \"are pitting minorities against the police\" with their rhetoric. \"Whenever there is a police shooting involving a minority, their knee jerk reaction is to allege racism,\" he wrote. \"That is insulting to the men and women in blue who risk their lives to protect ours. But worse, these allegations result in the murder of our police.\" The caption was accompanied by a  photo of a white police officer and a black police officer  holding their hands out to a camera, with the words \"His life matters\" written on their palms.  RELATED: Donald Trump: 'We must restore law and order' In  a separate post,  Stewart wrote, \"Liberal politicians who label police as racists -- specifically Hillary Clinton and Virginia Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam -- are to blame for essentially encouraging the murder of these police officers tonight.\" Stewart also  posted a link to article  announcing that Clinton will be campaigning in Virginia next week. \"This crook should be arrested when she arrives in Prince William County,\" he wrote.  Stewart is no stranger to writing controversial posts on Facebook, and he's known for his strong rhetoric against undocumented immigrants. As chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, Stewart led the way for a law that he claims has rounded up more than 7,000 undocumented immigrants in the county and handed them over to the feds since 2008. Reached by email, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the campaign did not agree with Stewart's assessment about Clinton and Northam. \"Corey does not speak for the campaign and this is not something we agree with,\" Hicks wrote.   Stewart's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and messages left with Clinton's campaign were not immediately returned. A spokesperson for Northam, who also is seeking his party's nomination for governor, said it was unclear what Stewart was referring to, because Northam hadn't issued any statements this week on the shooting deaths. When asked to respond to Stewart's comment, Northam issued a statement, saying, \"This is a time for our nation to come together and heal.\"  \"There is no place in this commonwealth for this divisive rhetoric, which only serves to politicize a national tragedy,\" he added. \"Having cared for those who are wounded in service of our country, I know the sacrifice these officers make and my prayers are with the victims, their families, all first responders and all communities affected by violence.\" Following the  death of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge , Louisiana, at the hands of white police officers,  Clinton released a written statement , saying \"something is profoundly wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn't consider them as precious as others because of the color of their skin.\" She also offered praise for police officers who are \"demonstrating how to protect the public without resorting to unnecessary force. We need to learn from and build on those examples.\" After  the death of another black man , Philando Castile, later this week, Clinton tweeted Thursday \"America woke up to yet another tragedy of a life cut down too soon. Black Lives Matter. #PhilandoCastile --H.\" Clinton canceled a Scranton, Pennsylvania, campaign event Friday, in the aftermath of the Dallas shootings, and her campaign announced she'd address the tragedy in a speech Friday.

Republicans have been engaged in a showdown for days over which corner of their party has Trump's ear in negotiations over  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  expiring in March. But if Trump's vulgar comments weren't already making moderates increasingly nervous that they're losing in the fight to pull Trump to the center, his tweets Friday, in which he listed demands for a DACA deal, were likely to make their efforts more difficult. The President on Twitter demanded increased funding for a border wall and said the proposed bargain put forth by a bipartisan group of lawmakers would result in the US being \"forced to take large numbers of people from high-crime countries.\" He also said the proposed deal would make chain and lottery migration \"worse.\" Democrats, however, have already made clear they would not consider some of the suggestions, and the comments are a major setback for an immigration compromise that seemed possible less than a day earlier. On Thursday afternoon, the bipartisan group of six lawmakers, led by Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Dick Durbin of Illinois, agreed on a plan to shield hundreds of thousands of immigrants protected under DACA from being deported. But their victory -- first announced by Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona -- was short-lived. The details hadn't even yet been shopped around to their colleagues when conservatives started balking at the agreement and the only man that mattered in the debate -- Trump -- sent his party back to the drafting table.  Ready to brief Trump on their negotiations, Durbin and Graham traveled to the White House Thursday thinking they would be meeting privately with the President, a source familiar told CNN. When they arrived, they discovered that several other more hardline immigration hawks, including Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, would also be in the room. The surprise was first reported by The Washington Post. A source described at one point Durbin explained to Trump a proposal to end the visa lottery in exchange for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for countries such as Haiti. CNN reported that Trump responded, according to a source familiar with the meeting: \"Why do we need more Haitians? Take them out.\" Cotton told reporters when he returned to Capitol Hill after the White House meeting, \"There is no deal.\" The bipartisan group had spent months meeting and crafting their bill and while it was long-expected to find resistance among restrictionist immigration types, more moderate Republicans on immigration had tried to make the case to the President that it was -- Flake put it -- the only game in town. Unlike health care or tax reform, the immigration bill would only pass with 60 votes, Flake and Graham repeated. That meant that negotiating with Democrats and finding a bill that could win their support wasn't an option.  \"I don't think we'll get all Republicans,\" Flake said Thursday. \"I never thought we would.\" But the bipartisan \"Group of Six,\" which included many of the same players that negotiated the hard right's much maligned 2013 immigration bill -- was being squeezed even before Thursday. \"Just because the Gang of Six or gang of whatever agrees to something, it's going to have to be vetted by the other members,\" Louisiana's Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican, warned earlier this week. \"There's a lot of folks who haven't spoken up yet.\" In the days leading up to their announced bipartisan agreement, some conservatives were more public and pointed about their doubts about the Group of Six's effort. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz told CNN flatly he couldn't imagine supporting anything the group came up with. \"Passing an amnesty bill that continues chain migration and has only fig-leaf token efforts and border security would be a serious mistake,\" Cruz said. And, the Senate's Republican Whip John Cornyn announced the No. 2s in the House and the Senate, including Durbin, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Democratic House Whip Steny Hoyer would take the lead in negotiations rather than the bipartisan group. \"We are not going to default to existing groups, they were too many groups to count and they were basically getting nowhere so that's why, I think, the need to move to this level,\" Cornyn told reporters earlier in the week about the new power structure.   The Republicans, however, are finding themselves in a precarious position. The President gave them a deadline of March 5 and they can't just pass an immigration bill without Democrats. They don't have a filibuster-proof majority. Not to mention, many of the most conservative members may never get comfortable with any bill that gives hundreds of thousands of immigrants -- even if they entered the country as children -- a path to legalization or citizenship, something some members perceive as amnesty. And, even if a bill was voted on and passed the Senate, legislation still faces long odds in the Republican-controlled House where there the differences between Democrats and Republicans are even greater. House Speaker Paul Ryan has far more hardline immigration hawks in his conference. Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, has far more members who are opposed to any kind of deal that set back the parents of DACA recipients either by limiting chain migration or other mechanisms. Still, it's unclear how Trump's comments will affect the negotiations for now. A person familiar told CNN that the language was salty on both sides Thursday, but added it shouldn't be interpreted as poisoning the changes for a deal. \"It's a negotiation process,\" this person said. CNN's Abby Phillip, Ted Barrett, Pamela Brown and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","articles_date":"12 1 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/01\/12\/politics\/white-house-immigration-meeting-conservatives\/index.html","articles_title":"Trump's comments threaten already-delicate DACA talks","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":320,"issue":5,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) President Donald Trump won't have to face voters for several more years, but his policies will be on the ballot in just a few months. Candidates for Virginia governor must pass through a rigorous primary in early June before entering the general election. Already, both Republicans and Democrats are using Trump's first few weeks in office to distinguish themselves against their primary opponents. There are three candidates on the Republican side. Two -- Corey Stewart and Denver Riggleman -- are hoping to ride Trump's anti-establishment wave to their party's nomination and eventually the governor's mansion. The third candidate, former George W. Bush aide Ed Gillespie, embodies the GOP establishment and is seeking to consolidate the many factions of the state party to give Republicans their first statewide win since 2009. Tensions erupt in Senate after chaotic day on Trump nominees The GOP candidates have vastly different backgrounds in the state. Stewart is the chair of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors and has previously run for statewide office. Riggleman is a businessman who is virtually unknown in Virginia. Gillespie is fresh off a narrow loss to popular Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in 2014 and is running a solid, risk-averse campaign. He could benefit from the potential of Riggleman and Stewart splitting the vote of Trump supporters. But the more Trump continues to make headlines, the more Gillespie has to respond, and the more opportunities that Stewart in particular has to distinguish himself as the candidate most aligned with the President.  It is a position that may play well in the primary, but could be dangerous in a general election. Trump won last year's Virginia Republican primary, but lost the state in the general election.   The best example of the dicey situation Gillespie finds himself in came this weekend during the rocky rollout of Trump's executive order temporarily suspending the refugee program and banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries.  While Virginia Democrats, like the current Gov. Terry McAuliffe, rushed to Dulles Airport to lend a hand to those being detained by Customs and Border Patrol, Stewart released a fiery statement supporting Trump's policy. Trump on travel ban: 'Call it what you want' \"The Trump administration executive order on refugees is reasonable and necessary,\" said Stewart. \"It is a temporary inconvenience to fewer than 200 people a day. It is what is minimally required to prevent terrorists, disguised as refugees, from entering the country.\" Gillespie initially avoided reporters' query on the topic before releasing a short statement offering tepid support for the concept while criticizing the media's coverage of the chaos on the first few days of its implementation. \"When you factor out all the misinformation and media hysteria, it's clear that a temporary pause on refugee settlements is a rational step to secure our homeland and keep Americans safe,\" Gillespie said. But as Stewart attempts to capitalize on the Trump phenomenon, Gillespie is finding ways to score his own points with the conservative base of the party without alienating moderate voters that will ultimately decide the election. In the days leading up to the anti-abortion March for Life last week, Stewart hammered Gillespie's stance on the issue and challenged Gillespie to join him at the event. As Stewart spent the day tweeting from the march and describing Gillespie as \"Abortion Ed,\" the veteran Washington hand had a plan of his own.   Minutes after Stewart tweeted \"Vice President Pence just drove by at March for Life!\" Gillespie tweeted from the march as well, posting a picture of him shaking hands with the vice president immediately after his speech. If the early days of this potentially rough and tumble primary are any indication, the next few months could prove to be less about balancing Virginia's budget and more about the current commander in chief. That's an unpredictable prospect that could pose problems for all the candidates running.","articles_date":"2 2 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/02\/02\/politics\/donald-trump-virginia\/index.html","articles_title":"Trump's policies to face early test at the ballot box","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":321,"issue":8,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's Friday tweet threatening to veto the $1.3 trillion spending bill has intensified a battle already being waged in key Republican Senate primaries over the measure. In three states -- Arizona, West Virginia and Indiana -- right-wing candidates had already staked out their opposition to the bill. But Trump's tweet has given them a new opening to cast their opponents -- all House members who voted for the bill -- as being on the wrong side of the Trump agenda.  In West Virginia, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who along with former coal baron Don Blankenship is running against Rep. Evan Jenkins in a May Senate primary, said Trump should veto the bill.  \"Let's hope that @realDonaldTrump vetoes the terrible omnibus bill. Congress & Evan Jenkins caved on the wall, paved the way for more gun control, and give money to Planned Parenthood. Jenkins is a liberal. Only one proven and credible conservative running!\" he tweeted Friday morning.  In Arizona, state Sen. Kelli Ward had already blasted Rep. Martha McSally for her vote, tweeting Thursday night: \"Want to know the difference between me and my opponent @RepMcSally? Try her vote today in favor of a $1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that doesn't include funding for a new #BorderWall but continues to fund #SanctuaryCities.\"  Friday morning, she retweeted Trump, thanking him and saying she was \"working hard so you have a conservative\" from Arizona to help his agenda.  In Indiana, Rep. Todd Rokita -- who voted against the bill, calling it \"the Washington swamp at its worst\" -- retweeted Trump, signaling that he intended to use the issue against Rep. Luke Messer, a leading primary foe who voted for it. Later, he tweeted his criticism of the bill, saying it \"did not include the priorities\" of Trump and Hoosiers.  In Ohio as well, Mike Gibbons, a Republican running in the Senate primary against Rep. Jim Renacci, is hitting Renacci on the spending bill -- even though Renacci voted against it. Gibbons' argument is that Renacci, as a House Budget Committee member, is responsible for the product.  \"The budget bill that just passed spends money we don't have, fails to fund the wall, but does fund Planned Parenthood. Jim Renacci can't hide his failure and ineffectiveness behind a 'no' vote on the floor,\" Gibbons said. \"If he can't get the job done in the House, how can he ask us to vote for him for the Senate?\" Gibbons on Friday morning retweeted Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who tweeted: \"I agree @realDonaldTrump should veto this sad excuse for legislation because it's $1.3 trillion in spending that (almost) no one read.\" ","articles_date":"23 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/23\/politics\/trump-tweet-spending-bill-senate-republican-primaries\/index.html","articles_title":"Trump's veto threat on spending bill gives ammo to conservative candidates in GOP primaries  ","candidate_fk":5,"first_name":"Patrick","id":322,"issue":6,"last_name":"Morrisey","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) The Republican Party's moment of truth on immigration is inescapable. Debate over the  fate of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants  brought to the US as children has turned into a pivotal moment for the GOP on an issue that has been heading to a boiling point for more than a decade. Now, with Republicans in control of the House, the Senate and the White House, the party is being forced to confront its deep divisions over immigration, which threaten to compromise its capacity to provide coherent governance. The debate is matching various party factions against one other and testing the willingness of the Republican base to accept a necessary compromise with Democrats that is certain to be portrayed by some as a moment of political betrayal. It's no wonder the closed doors talks on Capitol Hill are so tense and contentious and  President Donald Trump's  every comment is so closely scrutinized.  \"Everybody has their own franchise ... but somebody has to put forward a document, somebody has to put forward a bill,\" Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said Wednesday. \"I don't see any other game in town.\" For Trump, the immigration policy debate marks a watershed moment. It is one of the first times that he has been required to show genuine political courage, to take steps likely to alienate his loyal voters, who have stuck with him through everything. All presidents reach such a moment sooner or later, when the national interest, the requirements of governance and even their own legacies require them to expunge political capital they have spent years building. Trump's improvised and shifting positions over the past few days on what he wants to see in the bill suggest that he has not yet reached the moment when hesitation solidifies into resolution and trust in political fate. Yet Republicans on Capitol Hill say that only an unequivocal statement by Trump about the bill he wants to see, and a sincere effort to offer cover to conservative lawmakers, will allow a compromise to get to his desk. Closing the deal Given the central role played by immigration in his presidential campaign, Trump may be the only personality in Washington who can close the deal. But the President's comment Tuesday at a bipartisan meeting at the White House that his position would be \"what the people in this room come up with\" struck many of his allies in Congress as an abdication of leadership, and well short of the level of commitment needed to bring the party together. That has left the fate of the immigration bill, despite multiple efforts by different groups in Congress to find a solution, in limbo. \"In terms of how we get to the finish line, I'm not sure I see that yet,\" one Republican senator told CNN on Wednesday on condition of anonymity. \"Everyone seems to think there's the outlines of a deal, but like I said, I'll believe it when I see it.\" For Republican lawmakers, the showdown marks a moment when the responsibilities of power clash with their pursuit of ideological purity.  The party is split between comparative moderates who want to solve the issue, understand the political and humanitarian weight posed by the plight of those affected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and believe that the GOP must ease its position on immigration to ensure future viability. They include South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Flake, who have fought for years to enact immigration reform and are part of the 'Gang of Six' GOP and Democratic senators seeking a deal. Then there are Republicans who are more hard-line on immigration, many of whom see the prospect that those covered by  DACA  could be granted a path to citizenship as tantamount to amnesty, one of the most potent words in the conservative lexicon. Hard-liners on immigration include Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and Iowa Sen Chuck Grassley, who are concerned about questions like E-Verify, family-based migration and border enforcement. The chasm that the party must traverse is huge. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said Wednesday he could not countenance voting for the kind of bill he understands would be put forward by the gang of six. \"It would be inconsistent with the promises made to the working men and women of this country that we would put them first, so I very much hope Congress doesn't do so,\" he said.  Potent Issue No one in the Republican Party doubts the potency of immigration. Key figures in the conservative media have warned it is the one issue that could tear the party apart and even threaten Trump's hold on his dedicated base voters. In fact, immigration is an issue that changed the face of American politics, since it was used deliberately by Trump to build an insurgent power base that eviscerated the Republican primary field in the 2016 campaign. The current debate is also forcing Democrats into a searing process of political self-examination -- since the fate of DACA recipients is as important to their grass roots as the wall is to Trump's. Failing to fight their corner could have consequences for the party's support among Hispanic voters, who are vital to the party's hopes of winning back power on Capitol Hill this year and the White House in 2020. But since it is in power, the price for the Republican Party has never been so acute if it fails to find a resolution for DACA recipients. Overwhelming majorities of Americans support shielding people who were brought to the US illegally as children through no fault of their own, and the specter of mass deportations could be hugely damaging to the GOP in already tough midterm elections. Even lawmakers who oppose granting a path to citizenship for DACA recipients understand the need to avert that nightmare scenario. \"Right now, I think the best way to do this is not to offer any kind of long-term citizenship, but legalization instead,\" said Rep. Mark Walker, the leader of the conservative Republican Study Committee. As well as the national political consequences of acting, or not acting, the DACA imbroglio is forcing the GOP to question longtime and fundamental positions on the details of immigration as never before. That journey into the party's soul includes finally coming up with a definition of what exactly Trump means -- and will accept -- when it comes to funding the border wall that he placed at the center of this campaign. Will the President -- and his voters -- settle for an amalgam of walls, fences and electronically monitored border areas broken by areas of impassable topographical features like rivers and mountains, for instance? Then the GOP must shape its own position on questions that include whether DACA recipients should be allowed to bring their parents or grandparents into the country once they are legalized. The party must arrive at a definition of exactly what it means by border security and balance the demands of its rambunctious base with other Republican constituencies like business and agricultural groups that are alienated by hard-line GOP positions on workplace verification systems like E-Verify. The politics of the debate are so treacherous that there is no guarantee that any compromise forged by the various interest groups in the GOP caucus will win majority support in the party or in Congress, a dynamic that often played out in the health care and tax reform debates and can make assessing the progress of any reform effort highly uncertain. \"Just because we have two groups negotiating their position, they don't speak for everybody,\" said Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy. \"I mean they don't speak for me. I'm gonna see what this final product looks like.\"","articles_date":"11 1 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/01\/11\/politics\/donald-trump-immigration-gop\/index.html","articles_title":"Trump, Republicans face immigration reckoning","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":323,"issue":5,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Donald Trump clashed with House Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday after the top congressional Republican told rank-and-file lawmakers he will not campaign with the party\u2019s presidential nominee or defend him \u2013 and even suggested he\u2019s preparing for a Hillary Clinton presidency. ADVERTISEMENT The details of Ryan\u2019s comments came from sources on a conference call late Monday morning for GOP House leaders and rank-and-file members. The call was scheduled after the release Friday of a 2005 audiotape in which Trump is heard bragging about being able to kiss and grope women because he is a celebrity. Trump has apologized repeatedly for the comments \u2013 but despite an aggressive debate performance Sunday where he sought to turn the tables on Clinton, Ryan said on the call he won\u2019t campaign with Trump. According to sources, Ryan and other House GOP leaders also told those on the call to \u201cdo what\u2019s best for you in your district\u201d \u2013 advice that speaks to their concern about the impact Trump\u2019s controversies could have down the ballot. \u00a0 Ryan even appeared to signal the White House race might be a lost cause when he suggested in the call that the party should focus on ensuring that Clinton \u201cdoes not get a blank check with a Democrat-controlled Congress.\u201d Ryan\u2019s office later said he was not conceding the election's outcome and made clear he wasn\u2019t walking back his endorsement either. But Trump responded after the call by tweeting: \u201cPaul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee.\u201d Pro-Trump Republicans also pushed back during the call and said Trump can still prevail and should not be abandoned. Outspoken California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher called Republican leaders \"cowards,\" one person on the call said. Trump still retained the backing of the Republican National Committee, which has overseen crucial field efforts for the candidate in battleground states. On a conference call with RNC members Monday afternoon, chairman Reince Priebus said the party remains in full coordination with Trump. \"Everything is on course,\" Priebus said, according to a participant in the call. All 435 House members are up for reelection in November, including 246 Republicans. Until the 2005 Trump tape was released, most political analysts predicted Republicans would keep their House majority but said the race to control the Senate will be razor close, regardless of whether Trump or Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, wins the presidential contest. By Saturday, Ryan had already denounced Trump\u2019s lewd comments on the tape about women -- calling them \u201cdisgusting\u201d -- and uninvited the nominee to a weekend rally in his home state of Wisconsin. However, he did not withdraw his endorsement of Trump, as other congressional Republicans -- including several in tight reelection bids -- said they no longer support their nominee or that he should quit the race. \u00a0 New Hampshire GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, deadlocked in her bid for a second term, said this weekend that she favors Trump quitting the race. And Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Charlie Dent, chairman of the House Ethics Committee, told ABC on Sunday that his party still has enough time to rally behind an alternative to Trump, with running-mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence among the names mentioned. Trump trails Clinton by 4.6 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics polls average. Before the late-morning conference call, former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News that the defectors have \u201cegg on their face\u201d after Trump\u2019s debate performance. He urged the uneasy Republicans to \u201creconsider.\u201d Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway also suggested the team still wants and needs the defecting Republicans, particularly those running in so-called battleground states in which the White House race will be decided. \u201cWe welcome them back,\u201d she said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cWe would love their support. We have a lot of their voters' support.\u201d However, by the time the call was over, Trump and his team had struck a different tone -- returning to the message that the campaign\u2019s mission is to unseat the Washington political class that no longer acts in the best interest of America\u2019s middle class.\u00a0 Trump spokesman Jason Miller tweeted:\u00a0\u201cRe: today's  Congressional call: Nothing's changed. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has always been powered by a grassroots movement, not Washington.\u201d  Later in the day, Corey Stewart, the chairman of Trump's Virginia campaign, said Ryan and other party elite didn't understand that \"the grass roots took control of this party when we nominated Donald Trump.\"  Stewart said he was leading a group of Republicans to protest outside party headquarters near the Capitol Monday afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0  Stewart was fired immediately after the protest, which drew dozens of angry Trump supporters to the front step of the Republican National Committee headquarters. \u00a0","articles_date":"10 10 2016","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2016\/10\/10\/ryan-says-wont-campaign-for-trump-defend-him.html","articles_title":"Trump, Ryan clash as House speaker vows not to campaign with nominee","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":324,"issue":8,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) There is a web of connections between the Trump campaign, the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks and the public disclosures it injected into the presidential campaign. Federal investigators are examining some of these relationships and whether any of them were part of an effort to coordinate with Russia's election-meddling campaign.  This week, a new thread emerged: Multiple sources confirmed to CNN that the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, contacted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in summer 2016 to ask for access to emails from Hillary Clinton's private server. Sources told CNN that he asked for the emails because he wanted to catalog them on a searchable database that would be made available to the Trump campaign or a pro-Trump PAC.  There is no evidence WikiLeaks ever hacked or possessed the emails sought by Nix. But the contact alone raises new questions about Cambridge Analytica's potential role in Russia's efforts to undermine Clinton's campaign. It's a messy situation and, with so many unanswered questions, such as what Cambridge Analytica knew about Wikileaks' Russia connection when it sought Clinton's missing emails. Still, it's important to consider the broader context. The timeline below tracks how things unfolded, based on all we know. March 10, 2015 -- Clinton acknowledges using private email server Soon-to-be Democratic presidential candidate Clinton  publicly acknowledged for the first time  that she used a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. She also said she deleted about 30,000 emails about personal matters unrelated to her work for the Obama administration. The deleted emails, which have never seen the light of day, later became a flashpoint of the campaign. June 16, 2015 -- Trump launches presidential campaign Trump  announced that he is running for president , ending months of rampant speculation. \"I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again,\" he told a crowd at Trump Tower. When he declared his candidacy, Trump was in the middle of the GOP pack, trailing in polls to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio and others. July 2015 -- Russian hackers breach DNC systems Hackers working for Russian intelligence services \"gained access to\" the Democratic National Committee's computer networks as part of the Kremlin's campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential race, according to the  US intelligence community assessment  that was published after the election. March 2016 -- Another group of Russian hackers breach DNC systems Another group of Russian hackers -- separate from the group that hacked the DNC in 2015 -- breached the DNC's computer systems, according to a  US intelligence report  published after the election. The US intelligence community says Russian intelligence related stolen materials from the DNC to WikiLeaks for public release. CNN reported  this year that Russia gave WikiLeaks the emails through an intermediary. March 19, 2016 -- Russian hackers gain access to Podesta's emails Russian hackers gained access to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's personal Gmail account by sending a phishing email. The  US intelligence community determined  in early 2017 that Russian intelligence later gave WikiLeaks hacked emails from Democratic \"political figures,\" an oblique reference to Podesta.  CNN reported  this year that Russia gave WikiLeaks the emails through an intermediary. May 3, 2016 -- Trump becomes presumptive Republican nominee After  Trump's victory in the Indiana primary , his main remaining rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, suspended his campaign. By bowing out, Cruz cemented Trump's position as the presumptive GOP nominee.  June 2016 -- Mercer family endorses Trump The Mercer family, led by Republican megadonor Robert Mercer,  begins supporting Trump's candidacy  and starts donating to pro-Trump efforts. The family previously backed Cruz in the GOP primaries. The family financially backs Cambridge Analytica, which started working for Trump over the summer of 2016. Some members of Cambridge Analytica staff were incorporated in the Trump campaign's data operation team. June 9, 2016 -- Trump tweets about Clinton's deleted emails Responding to a quip from Clinton, Trump  posted on Twitter : \"How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?\" This tweet came the same day that Donald Trump Jr., Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met a group of Russians at Trump Tower. Trump Jr. was told before the meeting that one of the Russians would offer incriminating information about Clinton.  June 15, 2016 -- DNC claims it was hacked by Russian intelligence The DNC and CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm it hired to investigate the breaches,  revealed publicly for the first time  that its servers were penetrated. CrowdStrike said it \"identified two sophisticated adversaries on the network\" that were associated with Russian intelligence services. Trump  dismissed the notion  that Russia was behind the hacks, saying \"we believe it was the DNC that did the 'hacking' as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader. Too bad the DNC doesn't hack Hillary Clinton's 33,000 missing emails.\" July 19-21, 2016 -- Republican National Convention is held in Cleveland Trump  officially became the presidential nominee  for the Republican Party during the Republican National Convention, which was held in Cleveland. During the convention, a handful of Trump campaign advisers briefly met with then-Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Between July 21 and July 31, 2016 -- Cambridge Analytica CEO emails WikiLeaks Alexander Nix, the chief executive of data firm Cambridge Analytica, emailed Assange  seeking access to emails from Clinton's private server  so he could turn them into a searchable database for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee.There is no evidence that Clinton's deleted emails were ever hacked or that WikiLeaks ever had possession of them. The Wall Street Journal reported that the email was sent in late July 2016 at some point following the Republican National Convention. This was around the same time Cambridge Analytica started working for the Trump campaign as part of its three-pronged data operation based in San Antonio, Texas.  Right-wing firebrand Steve Bannon was a member of the Cambridge Analytica board when Nix sent the email, according to The New York Times. Bannon later became CEO of the Trump campaign and stepped down from the data analytics company. He took a top White House job in January but left over the summer. July 22, 2016 -- WikiLeaks releases about 20,000 hacked DNC emails WikiLeaks posted on its website  nearly 20,000 emails  that were stolen from the DNC servers. Many of the emails were sent by senior DNC officials. Some of the emails suggested that the DNC favored Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primaries, leading to allegations that the primary was rigged. July 25-28, 2016 -- Democratic National Convention is held in Philadelphia Democrats held their convention in Philadelphia and formally selected Clinton as their nominee. The gathering was roiled by the WikiLeaks disclosures, which were released days earlier. The emails upset Sanders supporters, and forced DNC chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wassermann Schultz to  quit her post . July 25, 2016 -- Trump says it's a \"joke\" that Russia hacked the DNC  Trump weighed in on the DNC leaks,  saying on Twitter : \"The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.\"  July 26, 2016 -- NYT reports that the US believes Russia hacked the DNC The New York Times published a report  that claimed US intelligence agencies told the White House that they were highly confident that the Russian government was responsible for hacking the DNC. This was the first public report suggesting that the US government agreed with the DNC's assessment. July 27, 2016 -- Trump publicly asks Russia to hack Clinton's deleted emails At a news conference , Trump publicly called on the Russian government to hack Clinton's private email server and reveal the deleted emails. Trump's campaign later said his comment was a joke. \"if it is Russia -- which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything,\" Trump said. \"But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell you this -- Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next.\" July 29, 2016 -- Trump campaign pays $100,000 to Cambridge Analytica The Trump campaign made its first of five payments to Cambridge Analytica, cutting a check for $100,000, according to records from the Federal Election Commission. August 8, 2016 -- Roger Stone says he was in touch with Assange During a speech in Florida , former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone claimed to be in touch with Assange and predicted upcoming WikiLeaks releases:  \"I actually have communicated with Assange. I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there's no telling what the October surprise may be.\" He later clarified that while he was in contact with Assange, it came through an intermediary. August 14-17, 2016 -- Stone exchanges messages with Russian hackers Stone  exchanged direct Twitter messages  with Guccifer 2.0, a self-proclaimed hacker who published stolen materials from the DNC earlier in the summer. (These DNC releases were separate from the DNC emails published by WikiLeaks.) The Twitter messages were about the contents of some of the stolen DNC materials that Guccifer posted online earlier that summer. Stone denies any wrongdoing or collusion. Months after these Twitter messages, the US intelligence community announced that Guccifer 2.0 was actually run by Russian intelligence operatives as part of the Kremlin's effort to meddle in the election. August 18, 2016 -- Trump campaign pays $250,000 to Cambridge Analytica The Trump campaign made its second of five payments to Cambridge Analytica, cutting a check for $250,000, according to records from the Federal Election Commission. August 21, 2016 -- Stone predicts upcoming trouble for Podesta Without specifically referencing emails, Stone predicts that Podesta will soon be in hot water. \"Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel,\"  he tweeted . Stone later claimed that he wasn't talking about the upcoming WikiLeaks releases but was alluding to an expose he was planning on his own. September 1, 2016 -- Trump campaign pays $5 million to Cambridge Analytica The Trump campaign made its second of five payments to Cambridge Analytica, cutting a check for $5 million, according to records from the Federal Election Commission. The massive payment -- the largest from the campaign to the data firm -- was for a TV ad buy, according to the  Wall Street Journal . September 8, 2016 -- Trump questions US intelligence on Russian hacking In an interview with TV personality Larry King , Trump questioned the recent US intelligence statement that the Russian government was interfering in the 2016 election. \"I think it's probably unlikely,\" Trump said. \"I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out, who knows? But I think that it's pretty unlikely.\" King's show is broadcast on RT, the Kremlin-controlled news network that targets English-speaking audiences. The US intelligence community says the Kremlin promoted its election-meddling campaign on RT. The Trump campaign  said it didn't know  King's show was broadcast on the Russian network.  September 9, 2016 -- Stone exchanges more messages with Russian hackers Stone  exchanged direct Twitter messages  with Guccifer 2.0. The emails were about the contents of some publicly released DNC materials. Stone denies wrongdoing or collusion. Months after these Twitter messages, the US intelligence community announced that Guccifer 2.0 was actually run by Russian intelligence operatives as part of the Kremlin's effort to meddle in the election. September 16, 2016 -- Stone predicts WikiLeaks will release Clinton emails Stone says in a  radio interview  that WikiLeaks will release new Clinton emails. \"I expect Julian Assange and the WikiLeaks people to drop a payload of new documents on Hillary on a weekly basis fairly soon. And that, of course, will answer the question of exactly what was erased on that email server.\" October 2, 2016 -- Stone alludes to future WikiLeaks releases Stone appeared to predict that WikiLeaks would soon post damaging materials about Clinton.  He posted : \"Wednesday @HillaryClinton is done. #WikiLeaks.\" Nothing materialized on the date Stone referred to, but two days after that date, WikiLeaks started releasing Podesta's emails.  October 3, 2016 -- Stone again predicts upcoming WikiLeaks releases \"I have total confidence that @wikileaks and my hero Julian Assange will educate the American people soon,\"  Stone tweeted , four days before WikiLeaks began releasing Podesta's emails.  October 5, 2016 -- Stone says \"payload coming\" from WikiLeaks \"Libs thinking Assange will stand down are wishful thinking. Payload coming,\"  Stone tweeted , two days before WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of emailed hacked from Podesta's email account. October 7, 2016 -- US formally blames Russia for DNC hacks The US government  broke its silence  about the DNC hack. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the entire US intelligence community, announced that the Russian government was behind the hacked emails released by WikiLeaks. \"The US Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations,\" the statement said, adding that disclosures on WikiLeaks were consistent with Russian methods. October 7, 2016 -- WikiLeaks begins releasing Podesta emails Shortly after the announcement blaming Russia for the DNC hacks, WikiLeaks  began posting thousands of emails  stolen from Podesta's Gmail account. WikiLeaks went on to release new Podesta emails on a near-daily basis, creating waves of negative headlines for the Clinton campaign in the closing weeks of the election. Trump regularly cited the latest Podesta releases during campaign rallies in October and November. The US government later said Russia was responsible for the hacks.  October 10, 2016 -- Trump says \"I love WikiLeaks\" At a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump expressed his admiration for the anti-secrecy website that was publishing dirt on his Democratic opponent, saying \"This just came out. WikiLeaks! I love WikiLeaks.\" October 12, 2016 -- Stone says he has back-channel communications with Assange Stone further elaborated on his relationship with Assange in an interview with a local CBS station in Miami. \"I do have a back-channel communication with Assange, because we have a good mutual friend,\" Stone said. \"That friend travels back and forth from the United States to London and we talk.\" Stone says he has never actually met with Assange or spoken with him directly.   October 19, 2016 -- Trump campaign pays $250,000 to Cambridge Analytica The Trump campaign made its fourth of five payments to Cambridge Analytica, cutting a check for $250,000, according to records from the Federal Election Commission. November 8, 2016 -- Trump wins US presidential election To the surprise of most political analysts, Trump beats Clinton to win the US presidential election. His narrow victory in the Electoral College was buoyed by wins in Midwestern states that weren't expected to go his way. December 12, 2016 -- Trump campaign pays $312,500 to Cambridge Analytica With the presidential transition underway, the Trump campaign made its final payment to Cambridge Analytica, cutting a check for $312,500, according to records from the Federal Election Commission. In all, the data firm collected more than $5.9 million from Trump's presidential campaign. January 6, 2017 -- US accuses Russia of meddling in the election The US intelligence community accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of orchestrating a multi-faceted campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Going beyond the October statement,  the new report  said that actions by Russian intelligence \"resulted in the compromise of the personal e-mail accounts of Democratic Party officials and political figures,\" likely a reference to Podesta. CNN's Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.","articles_date":"27 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/27\/politics\/trump-campaign-wikileaks-cambridge-analytica\/index.html","articles_title":"Trump.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein later appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to oversee the investigation, including potential collusion between Trump's campaign associates and Russian officials.  \"Look there has been no obstruction. There's been no collusion. There has been leaking by Comey,\" Trump added. \"But there's been no collusion, no obstruction, and virtually everybody agrees to that. So we'll have to see.\" Trump accused Mueller of hiring \"all Hillary Clinton supporters\" to staff the investigation. At least three members of Mueller's legal team have given political donations almost exclusively to Democrats,  CNN reported in an analysis  of Federal Election Commission records. In other comments in the full interview on Fox, which aired Friday morning, Trump reiterated how ineffective Democrats and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have been at winning elections. His remarks came on the heels of Democrat Jon Ossoff's loss to Republican Karen Handel in the special election for Georgia's  6th Congressional District seat Tuesday -- the most expensive House race in US history.  \"I hope she doesn't step down. It would be a very, very sad day for Republicans if she steps down,\" Trump said. \"I would be very, very disappointed if she did. I would like to keep her right where she is because our record is extraordinary against her, but we will see what happens.\" \"There has been a lot of talk about her stepping down,\" he said. \"We will have to see what happens.\"  Several Democratic lawmakers have  said  Pelosi's position as a prominent face of the Democratic Party will continue to make winning elections difficult. In special elections for House seats vacated by Republicans who wound up in Trump's Cabinet, Democrats  have gone 0-for-4 , losing races in Georgia, Montana, South Carolina and Kansas. On health care, Trump said he believes he will win over Republican lawmakers who have pledged to vote  against  the GOP bill to replace the Affordable Care Act.  Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah  said in a joint statement  Thursday that they're \"not ready to vote for this bill.\" \"They are also four good guys and are four friends of mine,\" Trump said. \"I think they will probably get there. We will have to see. You know, health care is a very difficult situation.\"  \"I have been here only five months, people saying, 'Where is the health care?' Well, I have done in five months what other people haven't done in years,\" Trump added. \"People have worked on health care for many years.

Mr. Copley, 39 and a registered Republican, was \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d with  Donald J. Trump  then, he said. But over time, in a paradox of the Bible Belt, Mr. Copley, a deeply religious father of three, put his faith in a trash-talking, thrice-married Manhattan real estate mogul as a savior for coal country \u2014 and America. \u201cGod has used unjust people to do his will,\u201d Mr. Copley said, explaining his vote. Now coal country is reckoning with an inconvenient truth: Experts say Mr. Trump\u2019s expansive campaign promise to \u201cput our miners back to work\u201d will be  very difficult to keep . Yet as he prepares to move into the Oval Office, Appalachians are eyeing Washington with a feeling they have not had in years: hope. The American market for coal is shrinking, industry analysts agree. Utility companies have drastically reduced their reliance on coal, in part because of  President Obama \u2019s aggressive regulations to cut emissions from power plants, but also because  natural gas  is cheaper. Nationally, about 300 coal-fired power plants have closed since 2008, according to the National Mining Association, a trade group. Many of those plants \u2014 including one in nearby Louisa, Ky., where a giant cooling tower was  recently demolished  after the plant converted from coal to natural gas \u2014 are not coming back. Politicians and economists agree that what Appalachia really needs is  a diversified economy , a goal that has eluded Mr. Obama and state and local politicians. But in this land of staggering beauty and economic pain, Trump backers said over and over again that while coal might never be what it once was, the businessman they helped send to the White House could indeed put them back to work \u2014 if not in mining, then in some other industry. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can ever fulfill all the promises he made even in four or eight years,\u201d Danny Maynard, 59, said after Bible study at the Chattaroy Missionary Baptist Church. Mr. Maynard lost his job at a coal company last year. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re headed in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wants to make America great again.\u201d Mr. Trump pummeled Mrs. Clinton in coal country. Here in West Virginia, he won every county and took  69 percent of the vote , a landslide also fueled by his promise to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices who would roll back abortion rights. As Mr. Copley put it, \u201cCoal is secondary to me.\u201d It is difficult for outsiders to fathom how deeply faith and work are intertwined here, or the economic and psychological depression that sets in when an entire region loses the only livelihood many of its people have ever known. Coal has always been boom and bust; its decline began long before Mr. Obama took office. But in West Virginia alone, 12,000 coal industry jobs have been lost during his tenure. At the Huddle House on Route 119, Kayla Burger, 32, a waitress, has worked three jobs since her husband lost his; they take home less than a quarter of the roughly $100,000 he used to earn. She took an offer for miners\u2019 wives to train as phlebotomists, but with so many miners out of work, the phlebotomy market was flooded. She also substitute teaches and cooks at the school. They have given up cellphones and sold their boat; one car has been repossessed; the only reason they still have their house, she said, is that they saw layoffs coming and saved money. Her husband, who cares for the children, has experienced depression. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel like a man,\u201d Ms. Burger said. Her father was a miner, too; he and her mother drive tractor-trailers now. In Williamson \u2014 population roughly 3,100, down from 4,300 two decades ago \u2014 everyone has a story. The city used to market itself as \u201cthe heart of the billion-dollar coal fields,\u201d but it now wraps its tourism pitches around the Hatfield-McCoy trails that run through the nearby mountains. (\u201cWe\u2019re the 50-cent coal fields,\u201d said Natalie Taylor, the executive director of the Tug Valley Chamber of Commerce.) Williamson\u2019s downtown, on the border with eastern Kentucky, sits between the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River and the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks. At the newly opened pulmonary clinic here for patients with black lung disease, Patricia Sigmon, a respiratory therapist, has been caught in the trickle-down. With coal paying less in severance tax to the state, there is less funding for schools. Her husband, a school bus driver in nearby Boone County, was forced to take a $4,000 cut in pay. Larry Gannon, 61, retired early from his job as a coal processing plant foreman so that a younger man could keep his. Mr. Copley\u2019s wife, Lauren, has a photography business, which is how they make do. They used to have \u201cCadillac\u201d health coverage; now they have  Medicaid . So when scientists, and Democrats like Al Gore,  warn  that Mr. Trump will endanger the planet, people hear that as something off in the future; feeding your family is here and now. Many say Mother Nature will have her way. \u201cWhen I was growing up, they said we were in an ice age,\u201d said Kyle Lovern, the managing editor of  The Williamson Daily News . He voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and Mr. Trump this year. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in West Virginia, where anger at politicians has been building for years. Mr. Copley remembers the Democrats who held power here \u2014 men like Senator Robert C. Byrd, who died in 2010 and  whose name  is on buildings and roads built with the tax dollars he brought home \u2014 and wonders why they did not see the coal bust coming and work to diversify the economy. \u201cWe\u2019re a forgotten people,\u201d Ms. Taylor said, explaining why it did not take much for Mr. Trump to win coal country\u2019s trust. \u201cHe mentions West Virginia, he mentions the coal workers, and that was pretty much all he had to do to seal this deal.\u201d Now that the deal has been sealed, Mr. Trump has put a  climate change contrarian  and friend of the coal industry in charge of his Environmental Protection Agency transition team. Environmentalists are horrified, but Bill Raney, the president of the West Virginia Coal Association, a trade group, is thrilled. \u201cJust a positive attitude in the White House is enormously important,\u201d he said. While American utilities are shunning coal, Mr. Raney says, some mines are shipping coal overseas. He sees promise in clean coal technology and says that \u201csome plants can get back on line\u201d if Mr. Trump dismantles Mr. Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. But that will take time. The plan is tied up in litigation; the Supreme Court was expected to hear the case next year. Mr. Copley, and many others, are waiting \u2014 and contemplating a divided nation. Mr. Copley is now a mini-celebrity here.  Yahoo News  declared that he had helped shape the race and invited his family to its studios in New York on election night. The family had never been to the city. Mr. Copley did not like having to explain to his children why anti-Trump protesters were shouting profanities in Times Square, and he later felt put off by the cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d reading a statement he deemed \u201crude\u201d to Mike Pence, the vice president-elect. At home, though, Mr. Copley sees nuance. His children\u2019s drama teacher, Dusty Smith, 36, who has purple and blue streaks in her hair, said she had voted for Mr. Trump because he seemed \u201cvery humble\u201d on  \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\u201d  At the Thanksgiving play Ms. Smith directed, an African-American teenager delivered a spoken-word homage to racial harmony. Watching it, Mr. Copley worried that his black friends would think he was racist because of his vote. People have asked Mr. Copley if he will run for public office; if God leads him to, he said, he will. As for Mr. Trump, he will give the president-elect time: \u201cHe\u2019s got four years.\u201d","articles_date":"28 11 2016","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/11\/28\/us\/donald-trump-coal-country.html","articles_title":"Trump\u2019s Promises Will Be Hard to Keep, but Coal Country Has Faith","candidate_fk":2,"first_name":"Bo","id":327,"issue":6,"last_name":"Copley","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Two senior U.S. senators are calling for swift federal action to help protect thousands of infants born each year to mothers who used opioids during pregnancy. ADVERTISEMENT Senator Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the children and families subcommittee, is calling for oversight hearings, in part to understand why a longstanding federal law directing states to safeguard the newborns is not being enforced. Another Democrat, Senator Charles Schumer of New York, wants the Obama Administration to put \"an emergency surge\" of funds from the new federal budget toward addressing the growing number of drug-dependent newborns. The calls come after a Reuters investigation earlier this month identified 110 examples of babies and toddlers whose mothers used opioid drugs during their pregnancies and who died under preventable circumstances after being sent home from hospitals to families ill-equipped to keep them safe. Six women who accidentally killed their babies while on drugs said in interviews that they wished they had received more help from hospitals or social workers. All but one of the mothers were sentenced to prison time in the deaths. Casey said he was \"deeply disturbed\" by the findings. \"This is unacceptable when children's lives are at stake,\" Casey wrote in a letter to Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican who chairs the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Alexander's office didn't respond to requests for comment. Despite a 12-year-old federal law that calls on states to protect drug-dependent newborns, Reuters found that thousands of babies born to mothers who use opioids during pregnancy are being sent home without social-service evaluations and safe-care plans - requirements under the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act. Since 2003, when the law was passed, the number of newborns diagnosed with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome has skyrocketed - from 4,991 cases in 2003 to 27,315 in 2013, according to a Reuters analysis of hospital discharge data kept by the federal government. \"It's become a sad fact that the latest victims of the prescription drug crisis in this country are the most vulnerable in our society, innocent babies,\" Schumer said in a news release. The senator called for the administration to direct a portion of the $47 million allocated in the recent budget for a substance-abuse agency toward helping opioid-exposed babies. Schumer did not ask for a specific amount of money. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said the senator's request is being considered. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also called for action. McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said the Reuters series \"brings to the forefront a problem\" that he has urged the Obama Administration to address faster. In the House of Representatives, Representative Evan Jenkins, a Republican from West Virginia, has introduced legislation that would make it easier for cities to create and operate facilities designed to care for opioid-affected babies and mothers in the critical first month after birth. Jenkins helped found one such facility in his hometown of Huntington, West Virginia. Jenkins said the news agency's investigation \"showed the devastating effects prenatal drug exposure has on our nation's babies and the magnitude of the crisis across the country and in my home state of West Virginia.\" Some advocacy groups are pushing for congressional steps to address the issue, while others are recommending caution. The Pennsylvania-based child welfare organization Center for Children's Justice asked for \"immediate, not delayed action\" in a letter signed by 24 other organizations representing children's advocates, pediatricians, nurses, social workers and churches. The letter was sent earlier this month to Casey and other Pennsylvania lawmakers in Washington. The California-based Children and Family Futures called in a letter to congressional staffers for oversight hearings and an investigation into whether state and county child welfare agencies are writing plans for safe care as the law requires. Two other groups raised concerns about what would happen to mothers and families if child protection workers became more involved in cases like those profiled by Reuters. The National Advocates for Pregnant Women called the Reuters investigation \"the latest in a long line of journalistic reports that perpetrate stigma\" against women. \"These 'bad mothers' are frequent scapegoats in a nation that is itself addicted to punishment,\" the group said in a statement. Another group, the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, argued that more intervention by child protection authorities would be counterproductive. \"Whenever we try to take a swing at 'bad mothers,' the blow lands on the children,\" wrote the group's executive director, Richard Wexler, in an opinion piece published by Reuters.

Hundreds of women, children and men belonging to the Rohingya Muslim minority have been \"systematically killed\" and driven from their homes, their villages burned to the ground by Myanmar's military, lawmakers charged.  Meanwhile, they complained, the US has made no major change to its ties to Myanmar (also known as Burma), and its officials have shied away from legal terms such as \"ethnic cleansing\" or \"crimes against humanity\" despite what many say is strong evidence. The continued violence is undermining Myanmar's fledgling democracy, they warned. \"In recent weeks, we've also witnessed the appalling images of atrocities being committed by the Burmese military against  the Rohingya minority ,\" said Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, at a hearing Tuesday to examine the US policy toward Myanmar. \"Hundreds of men and women and children systematically killed. Hundreds of thousands of people fled as their homes burned.\" \"Time for a policy adjustment\" \"The United States should not abandon Burma,\" Corker said. \"However, it may be time for a policy adjustment.\"  As lawmakers expressed their horror at villages being surrounded and starved, women being raped and children killed, Sen. James Risch, an Idaho Republican, told the witnesses \"there is no difference in our feeling, all of the committee. ... We all share this frustration. We all share this outrage.\" The foreign relations committee held its hearing as President Donald Trump prepares for his trip to Asia in early November. Democrats noted that while other administration officials have spoken forcefully about the ongoing violence in Myanmar, a country of 54 million that sits between China and India, Trump has been silent.  Now, as pressure increases for  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  to use stronger language including the term \"ethnic cleansing\" some State Department officials argued that they are not simply waiting for a change in terminology to act.  \"There have been many questions there about how best to describe the appalling treatment of the Rohingya,\" Patrick Murphy, the deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, told reporters Tuesday. \"I want to be very clear: We are not shying away from the use of any appropriate terminology. We have a deliberative process to examine facts, and a policy to support the pursuit of additional information to make such determinations.\" Murphy, who had earlier in the day testified about policy towards Myanmar before Corker's committee, was asked by reporters about the State Department's consideration of terms like ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity or genocide. \"I want to emphasize, we're not waiting for any determination on what best to call it to take actions,\" Murphy said. \"We see that atrocities have been committed, accountability is necessary to both end the violence, ensure that responsibility is taken for actions and acts that have been committed, and to forestall future violence in this complicated part of  the country .\" Lawmakers in the House and Senate have proposed a series of new sanctions on Myanmar's military, which, Corker noted, \"continues to control key ministries and large swaths of the economy,\" even after a 2015 election brought the democratic opposition to power and with it, activist Aung San Suu Kyi, who is now the country's de factor leader. \"Shock and dismay\" Suu Kyi's relative  silence in the face of the ongoing violence  against Rohingya drew criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike.  \"Her failure to acknowledge the seemingly systematic campaign of brutality by the Burmese military continues to undermine the civilian government and Burma's democratic transition as a whole,\" said Corker, describing his \"shock and dismay at her dismissiveness\" of concerns about what has been happening to Rohingya. Murphy said that Trump has discussed this situation with other leaders, that Tillerson had spoken by phone with Suu Kyi to urge action on this crisis, that Pence and US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley had denounced the military's response at the UN, and that the US ambassador in Myanmar has been discussing the violence with government and military leaders. And Murphy listed a series of possible steps the State Department  has taken  and could take to hold those responsible for the violence accountable. Those include, among other things, suspending travel waivers for military leaders, considering economic sanctions that could be used to target individuals, and cutting US military aid off to army units involved in operations against the Rohingya.  US officials have pointed out that \"these kind of abuses, this kind of displacement,\" not only threatens the transition to democracy, but it \"creates a much bigger risk for the attraction of international terrorism\" if the plight of the Rohingya becomes a rallying cry for militant Islamic groups, Murphy said.  Vigilante action But Murphy's descriptions of the way the violence started clearly angered lawmakers. Murphy said the most recent wave of violence that has sent so many fleeing across the border to Bangladesh was the result of a \"disproportionate\" response by the military to a Rohingya militant attack. He said that there is also evidence the military has been associated with \"vigilante\" attacks.  \"When I think of vigilante action, I think of sort of rogue individuals not connected with the government doing things,\" said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat. \"But this is clearly action that isn't just vigilantes, isn't just an expression of sort of endemic prejudice, but there's official actors involved, including the military, in ways that I think are not deniable.\" Pushed by Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the committee, to say that ethnic cleansing is taking place, Murphy said that he wasn't in a position to make that determination, but that it was under consideration. \"In the meantime, we conclude that there have been atrocities, massive displacement, depopulation of villages that cause us great concern,\" Murphy said. \"We are pursuing all avenues for accountability. Hypothetically, a determination of ethnic cleansing will not change our pursuit of full accountability.\"","articles_date":"25 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/25\/politics\/myanmar-lawmakers-outrage-ethnic-cleansing\/index.html","articles_title":"US lawmakers push for action on Myanmar atrocities","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":329,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) US leaders reacted with horror and sorrow to the mass shooting Sunday at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, with some calling for action on gun control as the death toll mounted. President Donald Trump decried the shooting as an \"act of evil\" and called it \"horrific\" in his first public remarks since a gunman killed 26 people in the Texas church. \"This act of evil occurred as the victims and their families were in their place of sacred worship. We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel and we cannot begin to imagine the suffering of those who lost the ones they love,\" Trump said from Tokyo, where he is traveling on a trip through Asia. Trump said his \"thoughts and prayers\" are with the victims and their families, but he did not suggest plans to take any legislative or other policy action to address the shooting. Sunday's shooting  happened in the late morning during Sunday service , causing a flood of lawmakers from across the country to offer their condolences and statements about gun violence in America. \"As my colleagues go to sleep tonight, they need to think about whether the political support of the gun industry is worth the blood that flows endlessly onto the floors of American churches, elementary schools, movie theaters, and city streets,\" Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said in a statement. \"Ask yourself -- how can you claim that you respect human life while choosing fealty to weapons-makers over support for measures favored by the vast majority of your constituents.\" Murphy has been a vocal supporter of gun control since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 killed 20 children and six adults.  The renewed calls for action on gun control follow the recent massacre in Las Vegas, which killed 58 people and injured nearly 500, making it the deadliest shooting in modern US history. That gunman used a \"bump fire stock,\" a device which allows a semiautomatic weapon to function similarly to an automatic weapon. Some lawmakers proposed Congress look into legislation to ban the device, but there  has been little action  on the matter on Capitol Hill. \"My heart breaks for Sutherland Springs,\" Murphy said. \"Just like it still does for Las Vegas. And Orlando. And Charleston. And Aurora. And Blacksburg. And Newtown. Just like it does every night for Chicago. And New Orleans. And Baltimore. And Bridgeport. The terrifying fact is that no one is safe so long as Congress chooses to do absolutely nothing in the face of this epidemic. The time is now for Congress to shed its cowardly cover and do something.\" Former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who has pushed for gun control since she was shot in the head in an assassination attempt in 2011, called the frequency of mass shootings \"alarming\" and \"not normal\" in a tweet Sunday night. \"I am praying that our lawmakers find the courage to face our nation's gun violence problem. This must stop. #SutherlandSprings,\"  she tweeted. Rep. Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana  who was critically injured in a mass shooting  at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, in June, praised the first responders who arrived at the scene in Sutherland. Texas officials, including Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, also commented on the shooting in their home state, offering thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families and praising the first responders. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from Texas who represents Sutherland Springs, said in a statement that he is monitoring the investigation and offered local officials \"the full resources\" of his office. He added that the town has \"a special place in my heart. Earlier Sunday, Trump tweeted from Tokyo that he was monitoring the situation. \"May God be w\/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas,\" the President wrote. The White House said Sunday that Trump is receiving regular updates. \"The President has been briefed several times and is continuing to receive regular updates on the tragic shooting\" in Texas, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, adding that Trump had spoken with Abbott. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the friends and families affected,\" Sanders said. \"May God comfort them all in this time of tragedy.\" This is a developing story.

The senator's presidential campaign is embarking on a concerted effort to highlight a more affable version of the fiery Texas Republican. He's started working the late night talk show circuit, a new forum for the senator, and his wife, Heidi, has also been appearing more often on national TV to present him as a likable figure. Cruz's two young daughters, who have already provided occasional comic relief to their dad's campaign, will be joining the senator on the road frequently. And his team is looking for more opportunities to put Cruz in fun, laid-back settings, like when he joined kids for a matzo-making lesson in New York. \"It's important for us to show him in more of a lighthearted venue,\" said Alice Stewart, Cruz's communications director. She conceded that voters want more than just a candidate they agree with on policy, adding, \"It's not a secret that voters will vote for someone they like.\" The lengths Cruz has to go in boosting his standing with voters were starkly evident in a focus group of Republican women this week in Pittsburgh. When the women were asked what they knew about Cruz, several described him as \"untrustworthy\" or a \"liar.\" GOP front-runner Donald Trump has spent weeks assailing Cruz as \"Lyin' Ted.\" And when focus group participants were asked what animal best described Cruz, some said a \"mosquito\" or a \"hornet.\" \"You just want to bat it away,\" one woman said. The session was organized by Public Opinion Strategies and Purple Strategies as part of the \"Walmart Moms\" series that focuses on female voters. Cruz allies say the senator is warmer than he's given credit for, particularly in private moments. Rep. Reid Ribble, a Wisconsin Republican who backs Cruz, recalled seeing the candidate playing tag with his daughters backstage before a campaign stop earlier this month. \"I remember thinking to myself as I watched him play with his kids, 'That's the Cruz America needs to see,'\" Ribble said. \"The more people can see the humanity of any candidate, the better.\" The campaign's emphasis on Cruz's persona comes as the senator fights for any possible advantage in his Republican primary fight with Trump. Cruz has no mathematical chance of winning the nomination through the regular voting and is counting entirely on overtaking Trump at a contested convention. Cruz's campaign has demonstrated impressive deftness in working the convention delegate process. But many party insiders view Cruz with skepticism \u2014 his reputation in Washington is that of a self-serving opportunist \u2014 and his standing with the public is only a bit better. A recent Associated Press-GfK poll found that only 26 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of Cruz, while 59 percent were unfavorable. Perhaps the only solace for Cruz is that Trump's numbers are even worse \u2014 69 percent of Americans view him unfavorably as do 46 percent of Republicans. Cruz's campaign knows that in order to boost his numbers, he needs to reach out to Americans beyond those who listen to conservative talk radio and know the senator from his fights with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, including his 21-hour filibuster against President Barack Obama's health care law that resulted in a government shutdown. In that effort, Cruz's campaign sees Obama as someone to emulate. The president has consistently had high personal favorability ratings and mastered the art of courting Americans outside the political arena. Stewart from the Cruz campaign said Obama \"may not have checked all the boxes for a candidate in terms of record and accomplishments, but voters liked him.\" Cruz this week even parroted Obama's famous \"yes we can\" campaign slogan, adopting \"yes we will\" as his promise to fulfill his campaign pledges. Before the New York primary, Cruz made the rounds of the late-night talk show circuit for the first time, appearing on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and the \"Tonight\" show. Cruz is also doing more public events with his wife and daughters. During a CNN town-hall interview, Cruz talked about a recent class picnic where 8-year-old Caroline \"got to dress up daddy\" in a pink boa and \"big goofy-looking underwear.\" \"It was on a videotape the whole time,\" Caroline continued. \"Uh oh,\" Cruz said, trying to smile. \"And now it's a class video that they're sending out to all the parents,\" she said as her mom and the audience burst into laughter. Cruz quickly tried to change the subject.","articles_date":"22 04 2016","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2016\/04\/22\/under-construction-kinder-gentler-ted-cruz.html","articles_title":"Under construction \u2013 a kinder, gentler Ted Cruz","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":331,"issue":8,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) On the morning of Donald Trump's inauguration, Keval Bhatt hunted through a closet in his parents' Virginia home for the darkest clothes he could find.  The 19-year-old didn't own much in black, the color he knew his fellow protesters would wear head to toe on the streets of Washington that day. As Bhatt drove into the city for his first-ever protest, he hesitated. \"I thought, there's a very good chance that I might get arrested, that my whole life could be radically altered in a negative way if I kept driving, and I was really close to turning around,\" Bhatt told CNN. \"But I think the rationale is that even if it did negatively affect my life, I had still contributed to this movement that was necessary. I was still making an effort to make other people's lives better, even if it made my life worse, and once I realized that, I had no regrets.\" Bhatt joined protesters dressed completely in black, some with their faces covered by masks -- a tactic known as \"black bloc\" that aims to unify demonstrators' efforts and hide their identities. And with them, Bhatt got arrested.  He was rounded up with more than 200 other people and charged with a felony for inciting a riot. He has said he didn't engage in any violence and has pleaded not guilty. A  federal indictment charges individuals in the group  with starting fires, property destruction and physical violence that erupted on the streets as the 45th President of the United States took his oath of office. Many of those arrested identified themselves as part of  the Antifa movement . Its name derives from \"anti-fascist,\" and it has come to represent what experts who track these organizations call the \"hard left\" -- an ideology that runs afield of the Democratic Party platform and supports oppressed populations as it protests the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites.  Antifa activists, who operate without any centralized leadership, told CNN that their goal is peace and inclusivity. They often denounce capitalism and government. Since Trump entered the world stage, they've condemned his push to tighten immigration rules and what some view as his tendency toward racism. While Antifa members don't fit a single category, they say many are millennials and many live on society's fringes: undocumented immigrants, transgender people, low-wage workers, those who don't conform to the traditional 9-to-5. And their methods are often violent. Antifa leaders admit they're willing to physically attack anyone who employs violence against them or who condones racism -- as long as force is used in the name of eradicating hatred. From Oregon to Germany Anti-fascists and the black bloc tactic originated in Nazi Germany and resurfaced in United Kingdom in the 1980s. Large numbers of Antifa activists first appeared in the United States at  anti-World Trade Organization protests in 1999 in Seattle , and then more recently during the  Occupy Wall Street movement . But their profile has been rising.  Antifa demonstrators have marched in more than a half dozen protests since Election Day in Portland, Oregon, according to police. Earlier this year, Antifa activists were among those who smashed windows and set fires during protests at the University of California, Berkeley, leading to the cancellation of far-right provocateur  Milo Yiannopoulos  and withdrawal of  Ann Coulter  as speakers. Antifa activists were in New York City on  May Day . When the son of Sen. Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic nominee for vice president, was arrested in Minnesota in March after protesting at a pro-Trump rally, he  was dressed in black bloc  alongside a group of Antifa supporters.  He faces misdemeanor charges  and has not yet entered a plea but will be in court next month. A Kaine spokesperson said he was peacefully protesting, and wasn't disruptive.   And white nationalists, neo-Nazis and others -- who have been blamed for provoking violence at last week's \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia -- claim it was Antifa groups that first got aggressive. A 20-year-old man who had attended the rally later used his car to ram a crowd of counterprotesters,  killing one of them . Though counterprotesters deny they are to blame for violence, Trump this week  declared \"blame on both sides\"  -- and  has drawn intense criticism  for his view.   Indeed, over the past year, Antifa members have been involved in clashes across the country and the world, including in Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, Alabama and Nebraska, and at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.  \"Anti-racists or anti-fascists are not a new phenomenon,\" said Brian Levin, director of the  Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism  at California State University, San Bernardino. \"What I think is new is that they're more active both in making themselves prominent at violent rallies and also trying to bridge into the disenfranchised peaceful progressive movement.\" Bhatt went in Charlottesville, too, and was just about five feet away from the car that drove through the crowd, killing  protester Heather Heyer , he said. Before that, he said, Antifa protesters were cheering in celebration for having disrupted the neo-Nazi message. \"We were marching down one of the streets, and energy was ecstatic,\" Bhatt said. \"We were marching and chanting and engaged in this huge act of solidarity. There was a moment I was at the front of this huge line of people, and we see this other huge group of people marching down another way, and when the two groups met, it felt like the entire city just erupted in cheers and roars.\" Spurred to action by Trump Antifa is impossible to track. It isn't united through a national organization, and it cloaks itself in anonymity.  In speaking to Antifa leaders across the country, CNN found very few who would take off their masks. Indeed, it took months to track down members willing to share their stories. Many are like Bhatt, a self-described government skeptic with liberal views who didn't find mainstream politics a good fit for him. So, he weighed his options. \"Before J20 (January 20, Inauguration Day) happened I was convinced I'd go to NASA or some university to research,\" Bhatt said.  Now facing a criminal record, \"I don't know,\" he said. \"My efforts might be better suited by an organization that helps communities.\" The son of parents who immigrated from India, Bhatt is sure of one thing: He has no plans to stop protesting.  \"There are people who were energized by Bernie (Sanders) that now are anarchists,\" said an organizer of the website It's Going Down, a newsblog for Antifa. \"People are freaked out by a Trump regime, freaked out by the far-right. A lot of people saw neo-Nazi symbols. There's a reason why people are becoming polarized. It's real-life stuff that's happening.\" Sanders, for his part, has disavowed violence and is not connected with Antifa efforts. A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders has come out against \"hard-left\" violence,  saying of protests over Coulter's UC Berkeley  appearance, \"I don't like this.\" \"Obviously, Ann Coulter's outrageous -- to my mind, off the wall,\" Sanders said. \"But you know, people have a right to give their two cents' worth, give a speech, without fear of violence and intimidation.\" The organizer of It's Going Down said his website traffic has grown from a few hundred daily hits to between 10,000 and 40,000 hits on its best days. \"There's a crisis among the left,\" he said. \"And they're looking for alternatives outside of party structures. The anarchist movement is one that's working outside structures. ... People are excited about that.\" Like many young Antifa members who spoke with CNN, the turning point for Bhatt was when Trump in late 2015 ad-libbed a campaign remark toward a Black Lives Matter protester, saying he  \"should have been roughed up.\"  In another moment that has catalyzed Antifa members, Trump in February 2016 told a campaign crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to  \"knock the crap out of\" protesters  holding tomatoes, adding, \"I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.\" \"There was a normalization of political violence which first started with regard to the Trump rallies,\" Levin said.  \"Indeed, we saw alt-right people manhandling African-American protesters,\" he said, using  a term many white-rights activists use to describe themselves . \"Then what happened is these fiery embers crossed the fire line, so now on the far-left they say the best way to resist is violence because they're out-gunned in this new era of President Trump.\" 'This is self-defense' For almost three decades, Scott Crow was part of the Antifa movement.  \"I fought (against) Nazis. I've had death threats. I've had guns drawn on me. I've drawn guns on fascists. I've been in altercations. I've smoke-bombed places,\" he said. \"I've done a myriad of things to try and stop fascism and its flow over the years.\" Activists don black bloc, Crow said, as a means to an end.  \"People put on the masks so that we can all become anonymous, right? And then, therefore, we are able to move more freely and do what we need to do, whether it is illegal or not,\" he said. And that means avoiding police, whom many Antifa members see as an enemy, as well as skirting the scrutiny Antifa activists often get from alt-right trolls on the Internet. Black bloc, one member told us, also unites the movement.  \"Even though it only takes one person to break a window, it doesn't matter because the bloc moves together,\" said a 26-year-old named Maura, who wouldn't give her last name.  In New York's Union Square on May Day, a masked member of the Antifa group Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council told CNN why he wore black bloc and waved a black flag. \"We cover our face because the Nazis will try to find out who we are. And that is a very bad thing because they harass people,\" he said. \"We're trying to stop them from organizing. ... When they organize, they kill people, they hurt people, they fight people. And we're the ones who are fighting back.\" It's a position taken by many Antifa activists: \"This is self-defense.\" Antifa activists often don't hesitate to destroy property, which many see as the incarnation of unfair wealth distribution. \"Violence against windows -- there's no such thing as violence against windows,\" a masked Antifa member in Union Square told CNN. \"Windows don't have -- they're not persons. And even when they are persons, the people we fight back against, they are evil. They are the living embodiment, they are the second coming of Hitler.\" Crow explained the ideology this way: \"Don't confuse legality and morality. Laws are made of governments, not of men,\" echoing the words of John Adams. \"Each of us breaks the law every day. It's just that we make the conscious choice to do that,\" he said.  Antifa members also sometimes launch attacks against people who aren't physically attacking them. The movement, Crow said, sees alt-right hate speech as violent, and for that, its activists have opted to meet violence with violence. Right or wrong, \"that's for history to decide,\" he said. But Levin argues the violence is giving ammunition to racists -- and is anathema to the Antifa mission.   \"It's killing the cause -- it's not hurting it, it's killing it, and it will kill it,\" Levin said. \"We're ceding the moral high ground and ceding the spotlight to where it should be, which is shining the spotlight on the vile.\" Levin, who for decades has attended rallies at both extremes to study radical groups, said he put his own body between an Antifa member and a Klan member when Antifa protesters attacked with knives at a February 2016 a rally in Anaheim, California.  \"No, it's not OK to punch a Nazi,\" Levin said. \"If white nationalists are sophisticated at anything, it's the ability to try to grasp some kind of moral high ground when they have no other opportunity, and that's provided when they appear to be violently victimized. That's the only moral thread that they can hang their hats on. And we're stupid if we give them that opportunity.\" Rubber bullets and pepper spray  Nearly seven months after Trump's election, police in Portland, Oregon, geared up for the 10th protest since Election Day pitting the alt-right and \"hard left.\" On that day, June 4, police were coming off a violent May Day protest in which they watched Antifa activists run through the business district, destroying storefronts and setting fires.  Before the June event, \"we saw on social media that there was a lot of threats being put back and forth that gave us a lot of concern about physical violence,\" Portland police spokesman Pete Simpson said. Hoping to keep June 4 from becoming another May Day, police created a human barricade. Officers stood shoulder to shoulder between two city squares -- one filled with alt-right groups, the other with Antifa activists. After a few hours, it seemed peace had won the day. But then police caught whispers that Antifa members were planning to push past police into the alt-right rally square. Officers moved in with rubber bullets, pepper spray and smoke bombs. They pushed the masked Antifa activists into a corner and detained them. Many shed their black clothing and left it on the streets as police decided whom to arrest. \"We did seize a large number of weapons or things that could be used as weapons,\" Simpson said. \"Everything from knives to brass knuckles to poles and sticks and bricks and bottles and road flares and chains. One hundred percent, they came geared up to fight if it would be allowed.\" Despite Portland's liberal reputation, it has a history of clashes between extreme groups on the right and left. Residents have gotten fed up with the escalating violence, Simpson said. \"It is new, and this, like, this rumble mentality of, 'I'm going to bring my friends, you're going bring your friends, and we're going to fight it out in the park' -- it's not something we've seen here,\" Simpson said. \"It's not good for the city. People are just frustrated by it. It's affecting their livability. It's affecting their business. It's affecting their commute.\" Law enforcement in several cities told CNN there's no excuse for the violence. \"The fires starting -- that we saw on May Day -- is something we haven't really seen much of in the past,\" Simpson said. \"The running through the street, breaking windows and everything in sight, we haven't seen it as consistently as we've seen it in the last eight months.\" In that time, more than 150 people have been arrested. They range in age from 14 to 66, police records show, and include several students, a cook, a franchise restaurant owner and a retail manager, a CNN review of arrestees' social media accounts found. On social media, many of the arrestees have posted anti-police messages and anarchist views. Some write that they feel disenfranchised in the current political climate, the CNN review found. In Berkeley, Antifa and alt-right activists have clashed several times since Election Day. Police say they haven't seen anything like this since the '60s. And in jurisdictions across the country, police told CNN they've started enforcing with new vigor laws that bar people from wearing masks during gatherings. For that reason, many Antifa members in Charlottesville did not wear masks, Bhatt said. \"It feels to me like there's a struggle in the country ... of the different kinds of speech and what's OK to say and what's not OK,\" Simpson said. \"But one thing is very clear is that free speech and protected speech can be very offensive and very hateful, but it's still not a crime.\" 'Put your body in the way' With no central leader, Antifa adherents have found each other in local communities. They communicate and recruit largely through social media. Their protests are organized via Facebook.  And of late, in active areas, monthly meetings have increased in frequency to several times each week. Activists take martial arts classes together and strategize about how to achieve their main goal: taking down fascists.  In Portland, where the Rose City Antifa has been active for a decade, members focus on outing people they believe are neo-Nazis, even trying to get them fired and evicted from their homes. \"We've done mass mailings. We've even gone door to door before in communities,\" said the group's leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"We've gone out to areas that we know that a lot of Nazis live with, like, 'wanted' posters, like, 'Do you have any information on this person?' and put them up in the area, and we usually get a flurry of tips like, 'Yeah, this person works here,' and so on and so on.\" But like other Antifa groups across the country, the Portland sect gets the most attention when violence explodes at its rallies.  And for that, its members don't apologize. \"You have to put your body in the way,\" the group's leader said, \"and you have to make it speak in the language that they understand. And sometimes that is violence.\"  It's a perspective several Antifa activists shared with CNN, even knowing that violence has led to hundreds of arrests across the country.

ADVERTISEMENT A local official in the Virginia suburb where the crash happened and a congressman from another state have criticized federal officials for not removing the suspect from the country after previous arrests, and even U.S.   Secretary   questioned why his deportation was taking so long. A spokeswoman for the nuns' order, meanwhile, said they're upset that the tragedy is being politicized. Twenty-three-year-old Carlos Martinelly Montano, who police say is illegally in the country, is charged with drunken driving, involuntary manslaughter and felony driving on a revoked license after the accident on Sunday in Virginia's   County. Montano was arrested two times before and charged with drunken driving, according to county police, and has also been arrested in separate incidents for other traffic-related offenses. Police say Montano, who is from  , was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement after at least one arrest, and a prosecutor said he knew of at least one other occasion he'd been referred to immigration officials. The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that Montano was released in 2008, pending an immigration judge's review of his case. As of August 2010, a judge had not ruled on his deportation. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano called the crash a \"terrible thing\" when asked about the incident during an unrelated news conference at D.C. police headquarters Tuesday. Napolitano said she immediately asked officials to look into the situation. \"This is a horrible case,\" said Napolitano, whose department includes ICE. \"Why is it that this individual was still out driving? He was in removal proceedings. Why were the removal proceedings taking so long?\" Prince William County's top elected leader and a Kentucky congressman, both Republicans, criticized federal immigration officials for not deporting Montano. \"As the facts surrounding this tragic case continue to come to light, I think it demonstrates the need for ICE to be more efficient and effective in their deportation duties,\" Kentucky Congressman Hal Rogers said in an e-mailed statement. Corey Stewart, the chairman of Prince William County's Board of Supervisors, says the accident highlights the need for federal immigration reform. Stewart championed and implemented one of the nation's strictest county-level anti-illegal immigration policies. The local law requires that police inquire about the immigration status of all people arrested on suspicion of violating a state or local law. He says it's \"extremely frustrating\" that even with the county's policy, not all those turned over to ICE are removed from the country. \"We handed him over to the feds assuming he would be deported, but instead federal authorities released him back into the neighborhood and he killed a nun,\" Stewart said. \"We feel like we are beating our heads against the wall.\" A Catholic nun and spokeswoman for the Benedictine Sisters of Virginia says sisters of the three nuns involved in the accident have always stayed out of the debate over immigration. Sister Glenna Smith says the Catholic nuns have always provided social services \u2014 including adult literacy courses and counseling \u2014 regardless of immigration status, and they are upset the tragedy has become fodder for policy debate. \"The Benedictine Sisters are dismayed and saddened that this tragedy has been politicized and become an apparent forum for the illegal immigration agenda,\" Smith said. \"It is not optional for us to choose mercy and forgiveness. We know this young man will be brought to justice, that's appropriate, and we hope he will learn to make better choices.\" Montano's car crossed a median Sunday morning when it hit the car carrying three nuns, police said. Sixty-six-year-old Sister Denise Mosier was pronounced dead on the scene, and two other nuns \u2014 Sister Charlotte Lange and Sister Connie Ruth Lupton \u2014 were critically injured and remained in a hospital on respirators Tuesday, according to Smith. It wasn't clear from jail records if Montano had an attorney.","articles_date":"03 08 2010","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2010\/08\/03\/va-police-illegal-immigrant-charged-killing-nun-injuring-car-crash.html","articles_title":"Va. police: Illegal immigrant charged with killing nun and injuring 2 others in car crash","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":333,"issue":5,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"A House committee on Wednesday shot down proposed legislation that would have required the Veterans Affairs Department to extend spousal benefits to gay and lesbian married couples in states that do not recognize same sex marriage. ADVERTISEMENT The proposal, in the form of an amendment to a bill calling for the VA secretary to meet with certain advisory committees about veterans' health care, failed 13-12 on an almost strictly partisan vote on the House Veterans Affairs Committee. The only Republican to vote in favor was Rep. Jon Runyan of New Jersey. He did not speak on the amendment prior to voting and Miliary.com was not able to reach him for comment afterwards. The amendment was proposed by Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nevada, who called on House Veterans Affairs Committee members to show \"one ounce of the courage [veterans] have\" and approve the amendment. \"How many times have we talked about veterans deserving our support, being heroic and getting the benefits they deserve?\" she said. \"We now have a duty to act.\" Titus offered the proposal as an amendment since the bill she introduced on it last June has been stuck in subcommittee.  \u00a0 Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, likened the current system, in which the VA yields to state policy on same-sex marriages for the purposes of benefits, to earlier state laws barring or not recognize interracial marriages. \"Take yourself back 70 years to soldiers coming back from World War II, when interracial marriage was not allowed,\" he said. \"You can't imagine denying [a veteran] benefits based on state's rights. We support benefits for all our veterans, not some of our veterans.\" Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, chairman of the committee, spoke against the proposal, saying that the current law predates same-sex marriage, and the state's role in determining the legal definition of marriage has been backed by the Supreme Court. \"In determining if a person is or was the spouse of a veteran ... the marriage shall be proven as valid [by the VA] according to the law of the place where they resided at the time of the marriage or when the benefits accrued,\" Miller said. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, also opposed Titus' amendment. \"I don't want the VA or this committee to impose its views on the State of Kansas,\" he said. The vote may have gone the other way had the proposal before the committee been a separate bill \u2013 such as Titus previously filed \u2013 and not an amendment to another. Rep. David Jolly, R-Florida, told the panel he agreed with Titus' amendment, and said it was wrong that a veteran who would be getting benefits for a gay spouse while living in Nevada would lose them by moving to Florida. \"My concern is with the germaness [of the amendment], the process \u2013 and frankly the frustration at times with how this body works,\" Jolly said. He said he would like to see the proposal brought up as a standalone bill at the committee level and discussed. The bill Titus would amend, proposed by Rep. Denny Heck, D-Washington, dealt with advising the VA secretary. In Republican House rules, \"germaneness\" requires that an amendment address the same subject as the original legislation. \"I oppose this [amendment] because of that,\" Jolly said, \"but I want a forum where we can have this debate.\" Last month a law firm representing gay and lesbian service members and veterans filed suit against the VA for its policy. After the hearing Titus issued a statement blasting those who voted against the amendment. \"My Republican colleagues chose not to stand with our veterans and their families, and instead remained silent, allowing this discrimination to continue,\" she said. \"They lack one ounce of the courage they so often extol as a virtue of our nation's veterans.

A White House official said Pence will be joined by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Texas' Sen. Ted Cruz for an \"operational tour\" of the border. The group will participate in a roundtable discussion with US Customs and Border Protection about the infrastructure and technology behind a potential border wall. Another senior administration official added that there will also be a conversation about loopholes in the current immigration laws that permit MS-13 gang members to come to the US. This was also the topic of a White House roundtable earlier this week. The vice president will travel to the border before President Donald Trump has been able to make such a trip, though Trump has said several times he plans to travel to see border wall prototypes. This will be Nielsen's third visit to the border in her role, according to her spokesman. She visited McAllen, Texas, about a month ago. Sister Norma Pimentel, director of the Humanitarian Respite Center in McAllen, told CNN that she has been invited to meet with the vice president. Pimentel said she hopes to express her disappointment with lawmakers regarding the failure to reach a deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. She will also emphasize why she believes a border wall is not the answer to the issue of immigration and urge Pence to meet with members of the community for a better understanding of the potential impact a border wall -- a Trump administration priority -- would have on the region and its people. The Rio Grande Valley has been seen as ground zero for the immigration debate, as it's among the busiest areas for Border Patrol agents. In fiscal year 2017, agents apprehended 137,562 undocumented people. The area is also home to the expected starting point of the proposed border wall at the controversial Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge. The vice president will continue to Dallas later Friday evening and participate in a roundtable lunch on Saturday for the America First Action super PAC. The vice president planned to speak Friday in San Antonio at a joint fundraiser with the money benefiting the Trump Victory Fund. Tickets started at $2,700 per person for lunch and go up to $35,000 for a couple to meet in a small group with the vice president, according to a person familiar with the event. John-Michael Torres, the communications director for local immigrant advocacy group LUPE (La Union Del Pueblo Entero), is organizing a news conference at a segment of border wall in Hidalgo, Texas, on Friday afternoon -- one of the cities Pence is scheduled to visit for an up-close look at the Rio Grande and a border crossing.  While Torres said he doesn't expect the group's message to be seen or heard by the vice president, he thinks it's important to express local concern over Trump's proposed border wall: \"Today's visit is symbolic of the anti-immigrant, pro-wall policies that President Trump has been pushing out. We do not want Vice President Pence to leave without him hearing from local communities who continue to reject the notion of a border wall.\" CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to accurately describe the Trump Victory Fund and America First Action super PAC events attended by Pence.","articles_date":"22 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/16\/politics\/mike-pence-border\/index.html","articles_title":"Vice President Mike Pence visits the Texas-Mexico border","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":335,"issue":5,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) If Democratic voters thought -- or hoped -- the Bernie Sanders versus Hillary Clinton saga was long since settled, then they apparently need to think again. Just across the Potomac River from the nation's capital, a fierce fight is playing out in the race for Virginia governor pitting the Sanders wing of the party, as channeled by former Rep. Tom Perriello, against the Clinton wing of the party, represented by Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam. The comparison seems apt on paper. Northam boasts support from all of the state's prominent Democrats and has a lengthy career in state government, which helped make him the consensus pick of the party establishment. Perriello, meanwhile, entered the race late, has zero experience in state government and is running as an unabashed liberal. But longtime Virginia political experts believe the comparison is not that simple. \"It is really more a battle between the national wing of the Democratic Party versus the Virginia wing of the party,\" said Democratic political operative Ben Tribbett, who is not supporting a candidate in the race but has been tracking voting trends in the party for years. Tribbett believes Perriello's run is a test case for Democrats in Virginia. \"The Democratic model in Virginia for several decades has been trying to get elected in a red state,\" he said. \"Now that Virginia is a blue state and it looks like it is getting bluer, the model for electing a governor in Virginia has changed.\" Northam represents the type of successful candidates that Virginia Democrats have run for years. Governor-turned-Senator Mark Warner once proudly boasted his \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association, talked up his \"Sportsmen for Warner\" advocacy group and embraced the endorsement of NASCAR stars.   In 2017, the two gubernatorial candidates are fighting over their mixed record on 2nd Amendment issues. Perriello is distancing himself from his own A rating from the NRA as a member of Congress. Northam is spinning a perfect 100% legislative voting record in 2013 from the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a local gun rights advocacy group. \"I can't imagine Chuck Robb or Gerry Baliles or Mark Warner or Tim Kaine running the type of campaign that Tom Perriello is running,\" said Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia's Center of Politics, referring to Democrats who triumphed in races for governor since the 1980s. Northam has stuck to the strategy that works. He has crisscrossed the state for the better part of the past four years in his capacity as the number two Democrat elected in state government. He has stuck close to current Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is term-limited under Virginia's unique state law that forbids governors from seeking re-election.  Northam is focusing on a very specific set of issues Democrats rely on, talking up his support for abortion rights, expanding access to health care and keeping the state budget balanced. \"Voters in Virginia are looking a bit more at the comparative qualifications,\" said Sabato. \"Northam has two terms in the (state) Senate, one term as lieutenant governor. He is essentially next in line.\" His solid campaign has helped him keep his support from the state's popular Democratic leaders rock solid. But while they continue to stick by his campaign, they are reluctant to criticize Perriello in any way. \"Listen, Tom had every right to get into the race, and I haven't said a bad word, and I'd never say a bad word,\" said McAuliffe. \"If Tom were the nominee the next day, I would be the first guy out there campaigning. What matters to me is getting a Democrat elected governor.\" And while Northam retains that support, Sabato argues a simple endorsement only goes so far.   \"They think they lend their names and that is worth thousands of votes,\" he said. \"Actually it is worth the vote of their spouse, about half of the time.\" Free from the confines of the traditional campaign, Perriello has run an unconventional race, embracing the endorsement of liberal leaders from outside Virginia, holding a rally with Sanders, touting endorsements from former Clinton top aide John Podesta and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as well as raking in funding from sources outside the commonwealth.  To date, Perriello has raised 51% of his more than $2 million in fundraising dollars from donors who do not live in the state. He has cashed big checks from figures like liberal activist George Soros and his family. All told, Perriello has raised more than $385,000 from people with the last name Soros. By comparison, 91% of Northam's more than $3 million in campaign cash comes from donors inside Virginia. \"It's the kind of thing that just a few years ago in Virginia would've beaten a Democrat,\" said Sabato. Perriello is tapping into the angst over the Trump administration that is fueling Democratic enthusiasm in unprecedented ways. While he is not shying away from Virginia specific issues, he is also emphasizing topics like the battle over Obamacare ( his campaign ad featuring an ambulance being crushed  has reached viral status with more than 400,000 views on YouTube), the Trump administration's travel ban and the controversy over Russia's alleged meddling in the US election.  \"It is well beyond anything I have ever seen before,\" described Tribbett. \"It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Democrats to create an organizational structure that we've never had.\" But Sabato warns that while Perriello's lurch to the left is what made his primary campaign viable, it could end up hurting his chances in the general election. Perriello's lack of state government experience and the fact that he has few contacts and connections in Richmond could be a drag on his campaign. However, despite Northam's obvious advantages in that department, his campaign has yet to seize on the issue in a tangible way that might expose Perriello's flaws. \"Either the Northam campaign is legitimately confident because of their private polls or they overconfident and lethargic,\" said Sabato.    Public polls show the race in a virtual tie, which means that the outcome of the June 13 primary will likely come down to turnout -- how many voters show up and exactly where they show up. If turnout is average, that could be an advantage for Northam. If turnout exceeds expectations that will likely indicate a surge of new voters -- people potentially energized by Perriello's underdog campaign. \"Older voters and the traditional voters will participate no matter what,\" said Tribbett. \"The new voters that come in that add to your electorate tend to be younger voters. They tend to be people participating in a primary for the first time and they would be more open to a challenger to the establishment.\" But at this point, most Virginia Democrats remain reluctant to pick a winner, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of the electorate especially barely seven months after Donald Trump's shocking presidential win. The winner of the Northam-Perriello fight will face the winner of what has at times been an animated fight between Prince William County Supervisor Corey Stewart, State Sen. Frank Wagner, and former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie, who came very close to upsetting Warner in a 2014 senate fight and is the perceived favorite in the upcoming primary.

By comparison, 91% of Northam's more than $3 million in campaign cash comes from donors inside Virginia. \"It's the kind of thing that just a few years ago in Virginia would've beaten a Democrat,\" said Sabato. Perriello is tapping into the angst over the Trump administration that is fueling Democratic enthusiasm in unprecedented ways. While he is not shying away from Virginia specific issues, he is also emphasizing topics like the battle over Obamacare ( his campaign ad featuring an ambulance being crushed  has reached viral status with more than 400,000 views on YouTube), the Trump administration's travel ban and the controversy over Russia's alleged meddling in the US election.  \"It is well beyond anything I have ever seen before,\" described Tribbett. \"It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Democrats to create an organizational structure that we've never had.\" But Sabato warns that while Perriello's lurch to the left is what made his primary campaign viable, it could end up hurting his chances in the general election. Perriello's lack of state government experience and the fact that he has few contacts and connections in Richmond could be a drag on his campaign. However, despite Northam's obvious advantages in that department, his campaign has yet to seize on the issue in a tangible way that might expose Perriello's flaws. \"Either the Northam campaign is legitimately confident because of their private polls or they overconfident and lethargic,\" said Sabato.    Public polls show the race in a virtual tie, which means that the outcome of the June 13 primary will likely come down to turnout -- how many voters show up and exactly where they show up. If turnout is average, that could be an advantage for Northam. If turnout exceeds expectations that will likely indicate a surge of new voters -- people potentially energized by Perriello's underdog campaign. \"Older voters and the traditional voters will participate no matter what,\" said Tribbett. \"The new voters that come in that add to your electorate tend to be younger voters. They tend to be people participating in a primary for the first time and they would be more open to a challenger to the establishment.\" But at this point, most Virginia Democrats remain reluctant to pick a winner, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of the electorate especially barely seven months after Donald Trump's shocking presidential win. The winner of the Northam-Perriello fight will face the winner of what has at times been an animated fight between Prince William County Supervisor Corey Stewart, State Sen. Frank Wagner, and former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie, who came very close to upsetting Warner in a 2014 senate fight and is the perceived favorite in the upcoming primary.

Corey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, said he wants Congress to intervene on his county's behalf to subpoena information on 3,000 illegal immigrants handed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement since the county started enforcing immigration law in 2008 under a joint local-federal program. If federal officials don\u2019t respond, \u201cit\u2019s likely\u201d the county will file suit, Stewart said. The county Board of Supervisors is stepping up its pressure on the department in the wake of a killing spree that took place in Manassas, Va., last Thursday, leaving three dead and three wounded. Jose Reyes-Alfaro, an illegal immigrant originally from El Salvador who was previously held in federal custody awaiting deportation, was charged in that case. It's at least the second time in six months an illegal immigrant with a prior record has been charged in Prince William County in connection with a deadly crime. \"You've got this tragic repetition of an illegal immigrant who at one point was in federal custody ... and comes out and commits a serious crime,\" Stewart told FoxNews.com. \"Unquestionably, there are going to be other serious crimes committed by illegal immigrants who we thought were being deported by the federal government.\" On Tuesday, the county board endorsed a resolution ordering the county to \"seek all available redress\" from DHS to obtain the information. It also is calling for Congress to request a full investigation into what happened to those 3,000 illegal immigrants that were turned over to ICE. The board\u2019s latest move follows a Freedom of Information Act request filed last year to compel DHS to release the information on illegals delivered through the 287(g) program, which authorizes law enforcement officials in the county to check the immigration status of suspects and turn over to federal authorities anybody found to be in the country illegally. Stewart said despite the supposed partnership, county police tell him \"anecdotally\" that they're seeing the same illegal immigrants back on the streets after handing them over to federal immigration officials. In the case of Reyes-Alfaro, a federal immigration judge ordered him deported in 2002 after he was caught by Border Patrol trying to enter the country illegally the year before. However, he was subsequently granted an \"immigration benefit\" allowing him to stay in the country. A DHS spokesman did not say why Reyes-Alfaro was granted that benefit but told FoxNews.com that his status was revoked in 2006, in effect making him an \"at-large immigration fugitive.\" Federal authorities did not find him until he was arrested last week. An ICE official said this time he will \"likely be deported.\" Particularly concerning to Stewart is the fact that Reyes-Alfaro twice slipped through the fingers of local authorities after his 2002 reprieve. That suspect was arrested in 2004 on a misdemeanor assault charge. He was sentenced to 90 days, but that sentence was suspended. Then in 2008, he was arrested for drinking in public and received a fine. Stewart said both arrests occurred before the county had implemented 287(g), so nobody checked his immigration status. Stewart said he's not confident the federal government would have kept him detained even if he had been turned over. \"I think it's pretty clear that they would have released him, and that's the information we're trying to get,\" he said. \"Who are they releasing and who are they deporting?\" DHS acknowledges that not every illegal immigrant turned over to them will necessarily stay in federal custody. According to the department, while violent criminals are detained on a mandatory basis, those charged with less serious crimes, like drunken driving, are evaluated on a \"case-by-case\" basis. As the board deals with the latest case, the county has also filed another request seeking information about Carlos Martinelly-Montano, an illegal immigrant who last August was charged with killing a nun in an alleged drunk-driving crash. The suspect had a prior drunk-driving record, so county officials wanted to know why he hadn't been deported. Stewart said the county heard back from the federal government last week. The administration refused to turn over documents pertaining to Montano, he said, and delivered a \"data dump of useless information\" about the other illegal immigrants. He said that file did not include any identification of the individuals. The ICE official said the agency did not fulfill the county request on Montano or other identities because it has to adhere to its privacy policy.","articles_date":"18 02 2011","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2011\/02\/16\/virginia-lawmaker-likely-sue-dhs-illegal-immigrant-data-killing.html","articles_title":"Virginia Lawmaker 'Likely' to Sue DHS Over Illegal Immigrant Data After Killing","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":338,"issue":5,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"A Virginia lawmaker looking to enact an immigration law similar to Arizona's is challenging the Obama administration to come at his state with a lawsuit, too, saying he hopes the   has \"so many targets\" they can't focus.\u00a0  Board of County Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart told The Washington Post that the Obama administration's lawsuit against Arizona will probably fall flat.

ADVERTISEMENT Corey Stewart, chairman of the   County Board of Supervisors, is gearing up for a lawsuit over immigration documents for the second time this year. His county filed a lawsuit in March to obtain documents about an illegal immigrant charged last year with killing a nun in an drunken driving crash. He said Wednesday that the county plans to file a second lawsuit in the coming weeks in federal court. Officials want more detailed information about the 3,800 illegal immigrants turned over to federal immigration agents since 2007.\u00a0 Stewart told FoxNews.com that since the county started turning over those prisoners, 380 have been re-arrested in Prince William County and turned over again. The incidents have fueled his concern that too many illegal immigrants are being released just because they haven't yet committed a serious or deadly crime.\u00a0 \"Ten percent -- that's an amazing number, because those are just those individuals who came back into the community, committed another crime and got re-arrested for that crime,\" Stewart said, speculating that the actual number of those released is \"a lot higher than 10 percent.\"\u00a0 He said the Department of Homeland Security gave the county some information on those prisoners after an information request was filed last fall, but he described that file as incomplete.\u00a0 Though Stewart complained the file did not include individual identification, DHS has claimed that it has to adhere to its privacy policy.\u00a0 DHS has acknowledged that not every illegal immigrant turned over to them will necessarily stay in federal custody. While violent criminals are detained on a mandatory basis, those charged with less severe crimes are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, according to the department.\u00a0 The department has sought to sweep up and deport the most serious criminal offenders. The administration on Tuesday announced that federal agents in May swept up 2,400 illegal immigrants in what was described as the largest operation of its kind. Many will be automatically put on the list for deportation, though some will have their cases brought before an immigration judge.\u00a0 But Stewart argues that federal immigration officials should be deporting most illegal immigrant offenders who are arrested.\u00a0 \"The public shouldn't have to wait for these individuals to commit a serious violent felony in order to be deported,\" he said. \"They should be deported as soon as they show an inclination toward criminal activity.\"\u00a0 Stewart's county since last year has been the scene of two deadly incidents involving illegal immigrants with prior records in the U.S. Months after the high-profile crash that killed a nun in Prince William County, another illegal immigrant was arrested in February and charged in a killing spree that left three dead and three wounded. That individual had been ordered deported in 2002 after he was caught trying to enter the country illegally but was subsequently allowed to stay.\u00a0 However, according to DHS, his special status was revoked in 2006, making him a fugitive. Still, he managed to slip through the fingers of law enforcement in 2008 when he was arrested for drinking in public. As punishment, he received a fine at the time and presumably was let go.\u00a0 Stewart's county has since received DHS documents regarding the suspect in the nun's death, but has not yet dropped its lawsuit.","articles_date":"22 06 2011","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2011\/06\/22\/virginia-official-10-percent-illegal-immigrants-handed-to-feds-re-arrested.html","articles_title":"Virginia Official Prepares to Sue Feds Over Illegal Immigrant Files","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":340,"issue":5,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina said Friday that she would not seek the Republican nomination for US Senate in Virginia's 2018 election.  \"I have made a decision,\" Fiorina said on the John Fredericks Show. \"I have decided that I can be of more value outside the system than a single voice among a hundred inside the system.

Stewart appeared on a periscope with Mike Cernovich shortly after he was fired from Donald Trump's campaign for organizing a protest outside of the Republican National Committee's headquarters. Cernovich, who describes himself as \"new right\" but has been associated with the alt-right movement, is an online activist who regularly tweets inflammatory statements about race and sexual assault, as well as unfounded conspiracy theories. One of his most controversial blog posts dismissed the existence of date rape. He wrote in a now-deleted tweet: \"Have you guys ever tried 'raping' a girl without using force? Try it. It's basically impossible. Date rape does not exist.\"  In another tweet Cernovich later deleted, he said that \"diversity is code for white genocide,\" a slogan frequently invoked by white nationalists. He also has said that people should \"slut-shame\" black women to prevent them from getting AIDS. He has also pushed conspiracy theories that the Orlando Pulse shooter did not act alone and that Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman was part of a sex cult. During Stewart's appearance, Cernovich explained that he calls establishment Republicans \"cucks\" because \"they like to see Trump get screwed over by the media, that's what they get off on.\"  (The term \"cuck\" is an abbreviation of the word \"cuckservative,\" an insult popular with the alt-right used to attack self-described conservatives who they view as too moderate.) \"Yeah, I would agree,\" Stewart responds, while laughing. (In a recent Reddit \"Ask me anything\" forum, Stewart  responded affirmatively when asked if Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was a \"a cuck\". He has also called his primary opponent Ed Gillespie \"a cuckservative.\") Stewart, who was let go from Trump's campaign after organizing an unauthorized protest of women who supported Trump in the aftermath of the release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, also theorized in the October appearance that House Speaker Paul Ryan could have been behind the leak.  \"I don't know what the source of that video is but I would not be surprised at all and if they were not source of it -- I would not be surprised if they knew that that was coming out,\" Stewart said.  Stewart defended his interview to CNN's KFile. \"Well look, if I get a call from a reporter or the new media, I'm gonna answer it, and I'm gonna talk to everybody, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't know anything about your past,\" Stewart said. \"I'm not gonna interview you before you interview me, so just because somebody does an interview of me doesn't mean I support everything that they stand for.\"","articles_date":"24 3 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/03\/24\/politics\/kfile-virginia-governor-livestream-appearance\/index.html","articles_title":"Virginia gubernatorial candidate laughed about GOP 'cucks' on controversial conspiracy theorist's show","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":343,"issue":8,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Virginia gubernatorial candidate Corey Stewart's campaign has, for the past year, made edits to Stewart's Wikipedia page to remove unflattering information and add more positive messaging.

Stewart, who is facing off against former RNC chairman Ed Gillespie in this year's GOP primary, defended the actions as necessary to correct information on his page. Wikipedia \"strongly discourages\" users from editing pages about themselves or about people or businesses to which users have a close connection. A Wikipedia editor  raised  a red flag on one of the users last October, noting that the user appeared to be close to the subject it was editing. The warning was ignored. One of the edits removed a reference to a Politifact  article  that rated \"mostly false\" Stewart's claim that he had \"cut violent crime in half\" by instituting a crackdown on illegal immigration. In its place, Stewart's campaign added language crediting Stewart with the drop in crime. In an another edit, Stewart's 2013 defeat in a  race  to be the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor was  softened  with the addition that the loss \"raised his statewide profile, which ultimately led to other statewide endeavors.\" In an interview with CNN's KFile, Stewart said that the campaign was fixing incorrect information.  \"We've had problems with people going on there and putting false information on there, so we've had to keep an eye on it,\" Stewart said. \"In fact there's somebody in there who's put, you know, I cracked down on illegal immigration, I led a big crack down on illegal immigration in 2007, and somebody went in there and said I was anti-immigrant, which isn't true. So, things like that have to be corrected.\" Under a  section  on his page about the 2017 governor's race, his campaign  added  that Stewart is \"widely considered to be the most conservative of the potential candidates for Virginia Governor.\" The campaign also  removed  information about his private practice as a trade lawyer and added information about where Stewart attends church. In one case, the campaign added that Stewart's role in the Donald Trump's campaign had \"thrust Stewart into the forefront of Virginia GOP politics.\"  Another edit  appeared to spin the reason Stewart had been fired by Trump's campaign. Stewart, who served as the Virginia chair of the campaign, was fired after he staged a protest outside the RNC without approval from the campaign. An edit to his page minimized Stewart's involvement, phrasing his termination as, \"refusing to shut down a pro-Trump women's demonstration protesting the Republican National Committee's lack of support for Donald Trump.\" One of the users added to Stewart's page that \"many political analysts believe, however, that Stewart's termination may actually benefit his candidacy for Governor of Virginia.\"","articles_date":"23 3 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/03\/23\/politics\/kfile-corey-stewart-wikipedia\/index.html","articles_title":"Virginia gubernatorial candidate removed unflattering info from Wikipedia page","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":344,"issue":8,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Virginia gubernatorial candidate Corey Stewart spent $1200 of money raised by his campaign to purchase tickets to a black-tie ball held for President Donald Trump's inauguration.

Steve Israel, a Democrat from New York, is a political novelist and CNN contributor. His next book, \" Big Guns ,\" will be released in April. This piece is one in a series of columns for CNN Opinion on life after Congress. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author.  (CNN) Dispirited Democrats received an early Christmas gift Tuesday with the  election of Ralph Northam  as governor of Virginia. In an American political ritual, the same Democrats who were prepared to treat a loss as irrelevant are now portraying their win as earth-shattering. Meanwhile, Republicans who couldn't wait to frame their victory as a sweeping affirmation of the entire Trump agenda now treat the defeat of Ed Gillespie, a former RNC chair, as a political asterisk.  But Virginia state elections offer a real historical precedent. In volatile political environments like the one we're now in, Virginia has curiously become a reliable barometer of a national political wave in the year following a presidential election.    It's not that Virginia is a bellwether, it's that it's Cassandra on the Potomac. It forecasts future elections, but its warnings are usually unnoticed.  Take heed, fellow pundits and prognosticators:  In 1992, Bill Clinton was elected President of the United States. In 1993, Republican  George Allen  became governor of Virginia. In 1994, Newt Gingrich led House Republicans to  win 54 seats  and take the House majority for the first time in decades. In 2004, George W. Bush was re-elected President of the United States. In 2005, Democrat Tim Kaine was elected Virginia Governor. In 2006, House Democrats picked up 31 seats to capture the House majority. In 2008, Barack Obama was elected President of the United States. In 2009, Republican Bob McDonnell became Governor in Richmond. In 2010, House Republicans won 63 seats and  recaptured their majority .   Virginia's prescience doesn't hold every year. But it's been the frothing tip of every wave election in the past 25 years. And right now, I suspect there are plenty of House Republicans looking for the high ground of  retirement . Virginia's Tuesday election has implications far beyond 2018. Every 10 years, states engage in congressional redistricting. (Full disclosure: I'm a strategic adviser to the Democratic Governors Association, which is working to advocate for the election of governors, who have a key voice in that process). Depending on the state, the party that controls the government draws the squiggly congressional maps designed to elect House members of the same party for the ensuing decade.  Republicans did a brilliant job of defeating almost 1,000 Democratic governors, state legislators and other local officials after 2008. They took control of redistricting and built a  firewall against House Democratic gains . That process -- used by both parties -- is why Congress is so polarized today. Redistricting is a perverse take on that old song, \"Hokey Pokey:\" you put your right foot in, you take your left foot out.    That was certainly true in Virginia in 2011 -- where Virginia's Republican governor signed congressional and legislative maps that have since been struck down as illegal racial gerrymanders by the courts. Under those 2011 gerrymandered maps, Democrats in Virginia held just 3 out of 11 Congressional seats in 2016. After the  US Supreme Court  invalidated Virginia's congressional map, Governor McAuliffe refused to sign redrawn lines that were not fair, resulting in the intervention of the courts and a new map that netted Democrats one seat.  The Democratic victory in Virginia sets the stage for leveling the redistricting playing field that's so advantaged Republicans.  The legendary Former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill famously said, \"All politics is local.\" In the case of Virginia, local politics is national.","articles_date":"9 11 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/11\/09\/opinions\/virginia-election-redistricting-potential-opinion-israel\/index.html","articles_title":"Virginia may foretell a brighter future for Dems","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":346,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) A Virginia police officer was killed  while responding to a domestic-related shooting a day after she was sworn in, authorities said.

Lee monument in Charlottesville, Virginia -- the removal of which helped spark the protests that turned violent last weekend -- is just one example of the hundreds of statues, monuments, highways and holidays designed to honor the Commonwealth's Confederate roots.  The controversial connection to Virginia's Civil War past is quickly becoming a flashpoint in the upcoming race for governor, and the Republican nominee in that race, Ed Gillespie, is at the center of this divide.  Gillespie, a New Jersey native who has lived his adult life in Northern Virginia, does not have a familial connection to the Old South. He has walked a careful line when it comes to the romantic view of the Confederacy that many Virginians both Republican and Democrat hold.  At the height of the Republican primary earlier this year, Gillespie was being pushed hard about his stance on Confederate Monuments by his far right opponent Prince William County Board of Supervisors Chair, Corey Stewart. Stewart made the protection of these monuments -- specifically  the Lee monument in Charlottesville  -- a core tenant of his campaign. He accused Gillespie of supporting the decision to bring the monument down. In response to Stewart's attacks Gillespie ran targeted digital ads designed to correct his stance on the issue. The ads touted Gillespie's defense of the monuments and linked to a page on his official website outlining his stance. \"Ed opposes removing the Lee Statue and believes the city council members who voted to spend $300,000 of taxpayer dollars to do so should be voted out of office,\" the website read. \"But as a conservative, Ed also knows that a governor powerful enough to force one locality to keep a statute is powerful enough to make all localities take them down.\" The digital ads had a very short run and the Gillespie campaign would not disclose how much was spent. The website explaining his position on the monument still exists on his main campaign page, but has been removed from the \"Get the Facts\" blog where it was originally posted. Gillespie ended up narrowly beating Stewart in a surprisingly close GOP primary. Stewart has already launched a campaign to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, in 2018. In the wake of the Charlottesville demonstrations, Gillespie was quick to denounce the white supremacists that attended the rally and used much stronger language, much quicker than his fellow Republican, President Donald Trump did at the time.  \"Having a right to spew vile hate does not make it right.

After the President's controversial press conference on Tuesday where he doubled down on his belief that  there were bad actors on \"both sides \" of the protests, Gillespie sent out another tweet condemning white supremacists, but did not mention Trump. Gillespie was scheduled to hold a fundraiser with Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday, but the Vice President abruptly pulled out of the event in order to provide flexibility in his schedule in case the President needs his help after a high-level meeting that will take place Friday at Camp David.

His previously stated stance is that he personally thinks the monuments should stay in place, but believes it is the responsibility of the localities to make those decisions. On Wednesday, he released  a lengthy essay on his position on his campaign website . He offered several qualifiers to explain where he stands, but ultimately concludes that the monuments are a necessary tool to explain Virginia's role in history. \"There is a balance that can be struck here, one that recognizes the outsized role Virginia has played in our history while acknowledging that we have not always been on its right side,\" Gillespie wrote. \"Rather than glorifying their objects, the statues should be instructional.\" Where do Democrats stand  Gillespie's position is not dissimilar to prominent Democratic politicians in Virginia.  There may be no greater example of the impact of Confederate heritage on the landscape of a city than in the Commonwealth's capital and the former capital of the Confederacy, Richmond.  Richmond's historic Monument Avenue is lined with grand statues honoring the likes of Lee, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and General Stonewall Jackson. And while Democratic politicians have controlled city government in Richmond for a generation there has been no significant movement to remove or alter the displays. Richmond's current Democratic Mayor LeVar Stoney is African American. Stoney has called the monuments \"very offensive,\" but at one point declared that he does not believe the monuments should come down. He originally pushed for the displays to include some context as to the impact these confederate figures had on Virginia and the United States. \"It is about telling the complete truth,\" Stoney said recently at a groundbreaking for the new American Civil War Museum in Richmond. \"I don't think removal of symbols does anything for telling the actual truth or changes the state and culture of racism in this country today.\" Stoney has formed a commission to study the issue and offer proposals to highlight the historical context of these figures and that original position was often by cited by Gillespie as an example of local control over the monuments. But Wednesday, Stoney reversed course. He plans to continue the work of the commission, but now personally is advocating for their complete removal. Removing the political cover his position provided Gillespie. \"These monuments should be part of our dark past and not of our bright future,\" he said. \"I personally believe they are offensive and need to be removed.\" The Democratic nominee Ralph Northam also believes that the control over Confederate monuments should be left to localities, but unlike Gillespie he personally supports their removal. \"If there are statues that are divisive and you know breed hatred and bigotry then they need to be in museums,\" Northam said. \"That's a decision that would need to be made at the local level.\"  Virginia's Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat,  vetoed a measure in 2016  that would've prevented localities from deciding the future of monuments or war memorials erected before 1998. In his veto message McAuliffe said that he is in favor of the \"constructive dialogue\" regarding the monuments, but also said that his administration \"strongly supports historic preservation efforts, including the preservation of war memorials and monuments.\" McAuliffe also announced on Wednesday that he is personally advocating for the removal of Confederate monuments in Virginia. The veto was held up, but the bill itself initially pass the House of Delegates by an 86-16 margin which included several Democrats supporting the legislation. Northam has said he also would've vetoed the legislation, while Gillespie has yet to give his position.

Lee monument in Charlottesville, Virginia -- the removal of which helped spark the protests that turned violent last weekend -- is just one example of the hundreds of statues, monuments, highways and holidays designed to honor the Commonwealth's Confederate roots.  The controversial connection to Virginia's Civil War past is quickly becoming a flashpoint in the upcoming race for governor, and the Republican nominee in that race, Ed Gillespie, is at the center of this divide.  Gillespie, a New Jersey native who has lived his adult life in Northern Virginia, does not have a familial connection to the Old South. He has walked a careful line when it comes to the romantic view of the Confederacy that many Virginians both Republican and Democrat hold.  At the height of the Republican primary earlier this year, Gillespie was being pushed hard about his stance on Confederate Monuments by his far right opponent Prince William County Board of Supervisors Chair, Corey Stewart. Stewart made the protection of these monuments -- specifically  the Lee monument in Charlottesville  -- a core tenant of his campaign. He accused Gillespie of supporting the decision to bring the monument down. In response to Stewart's attacks Gillespie ran targeted digital ads designed to correct his stance on the issue. The ads touted Gillespie's defense of the monuments and linked to a page on his official website outlining his stance. \"Ed opposes removing the Lee Statue and believes the city council members who voted to spend $300,000 of taxpayer dollars to do so should be voted out of office,\" the website read. \"But as a conservative, Ed also knows that a governor powerful enough to force one locality to keep a statute is powerful enough to make all localities take them down.\" The digital ads had a very short run and the Gillespie campaign would not disclose how much was spent. The website explaining his position on the monument still exists on his main campaign page, but has been removed from the \"Get the Facts\" blog where it was originally posted. Gillespie ended up narrowly beating Stewart in a surprisingly close GOP primary. Stewart has already launched a campaign to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, in 2018. In the wake of the Charlottesville demonstrations, Gillespie was quick to denounce the white supremacists that attended the rally and used much stronger language, much quicker than his fellow Republican, President Donald Trump did at the time.  \"Having a right to spew vile hate does not make it right.

Barnes is a member of the CNN Decision Desk and co-author of the forthcoming 2018 Almanac of American Politics.  (CNN) The dynamics of the 2016 presidential race continue to shape the nation's political terrain, and the latest evidence of that fact is this week's primary results for governor in Virginia. In both the Democratic and Republican races, an urban-rural divide defined the outcome of those contests. While these races have a tendency to hinge on local issues, Virginia is a key battleground during presidential and midterm election years. It's the first such state primary in a battleground since 2016, when President Donald Trump lost Virginia and Hillary Clinton carried the state's major metropolitan areas and their suburbs, particularly those outside of Washington, DC and Richmond. The Republicans Ed Gillespie, the former lobbyist and Republican National Committee chairman, parlayed his establishment connections and a strong showing in an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 2014 into a narrow 44%-43% GOP primary victory over Prince William County Board of Supervisors chairman Corey Stewart. Veteran GOP state Senator Frank Wagner of Virginia Beach finished a distant third with 14%, based on complete but unofficial returns. Gillespie owes his 4,300-vote statewide margin of victory to his strength in the close-in suburbs of Washington, DC, and Richmond, the state capital.  In Fairfax County, the largest vote-producer in the primary just outside of Washington, Gillespie defeated Stewart, 48%-39%. Along with his two-to-one advantage over Stewart in nearby Arlington and Alexandria, Gillespie garnered roughly 7,700 votes more than Stewart in these areas. Stewart, who aligned himself closely with the views of Trump, ran well on his home turf, the more working-class Washington exurbs of Prince William, defeating Gillespie 60%-32%. Gillespie narrowly prevailed in the more upscale and better-educated exurbs of Loudoun County, 45%-43%. But in the rest of the exurbs beyond the Washington Beltway, Stewart won a plurality of the votes. Gillespie captured nearly 60% of the Republican primary votes cast in Richmond and its suburbs of Henrico County. He also narrowly carried the Hampton Roads region, Virginia's other main urban center, which includes Chesapeake, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach, winning just over a third of the votes cast there. Had Wagner not been on the ballot, Gillespie likely would have increased his margins in this area as well. Outside of Lynchburg and the Roanoke metro area, Stewart won wide swaths of the central and western Virginia rural communities, and nearly engineered an upset that few observers gave him much of a chance to pull off. The Democrats Virginia's \"urban crescent,\" also played a critical role in the Democratic primary, where Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam handily defeated former Rep. Tom Perriello, 56%-44%. Northam, who had wide backing from the state's Democratic Party establishment, trounced Perriello in Virginia's Hampton Roads region. He won roughly seven-out-of-10 votes in this area that is next door to the state Senate district he once held. Northam also swept Richmond as well as its suburbs and exurbs.  Perriello carried the 5th Congressional District in central Virginia, which he represented for one term ending in 2011, except for the portions that stretched into the Washington, DC, exurbs of Fauquier and Rappahannock Counties. He also won most of the rural counties in the Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenandoah Valley on the western rim of the state save for half a dozen counties in its southwestern corner, where coal production peaked 20 years ago. Perriello's staunch opposition to a proposed natural gas pipeline just north of the coal region may have hurt him among voters whose communities and culture are tied to fossil fuels. But Perriello, who had moved to Arlington in Northern Virginia after his defeat in the 2010 midterm elections, was unable to gain much traction in the Washington suburbs and exurbs, where a strong performance is essential for Democratic candidates. Perriello fought Northam to almost a draw in both Loudoun and Prince William Counties, but in wealthy and increasingly diverse Fairfax County, where almost one-out-of-six of the Democratic primary votes were cast; Northam defeated Perriello 60%-40%. Likewise, he beat Perriello by three-to-two margins in the Democratic bastions of Alexandria and Arlington. While Perriello's television advertising featured footage of President Barack Obama touting him in the 2010 midterm elections, Northam ran very strong in urban areas where African-American voters account for a large proportion of the electorate like Hampton, Norfolk, Petersburg and Portsmouth. Northam also swept rural counties with majority black populations like Brunswick, Charles City, Greensville and Sussex. In all of these jurisdictions, Northam won more than 70% of the vote. Higher turnout for Democrats Roughly 542,000 ballots were cast in the Democratic primary and the GOP contest tallied some 366,000 votes. Virginia has almost 5.5 million registered voters, so the combined turnout was almost 17%. This is the first time since 1949 that both parties have conducted a primary for the same gubernatorial election, so turnout comparisons are difficult to make. In 2009, the last time the Democrats held a contested gubernatorial primary, just over 319,000 votes were cast. In 2005, Republicans held a noncompetitive primary for governor and some 175,000 ballots were tallied. In the 2013 gubernatorial general election, roughly 43% of the state's registered voters went to the polls.","articles_date":"14 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/14\/politics\/virginias-urban-divide-gubernatorial-primary\/index.html","articles_title":"Virginia's urban divide shows in gubernatorial outcome","candidate_fk":12,"first_name":"Corey","id":350,"issue":8,"last_name":"Stewart","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) The Senate voted in favor of a motion to proceed with debate on the GOP health care bill Tuesday afternoon.

Mary Landrieu has also come out swinging against the EPA\u2019s power plant rule, saying such carbon limits should be done through Congress and not through executive fiat. \u201cWhile it is important to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, this should not be achieved by EPA regulations,\u201d Landrieu said. \u201cCongress should set the terms, goals and timeframe.\u201d Landrieu has been attacked by opponents for being ineffective at convincing the Obama administration to approve the Keystone XL pipeline and adopt a more hydrocarbon-friendly energy agenda. Last month, Landrieu   other vulnerable Democratic senators, including Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Warner of Virginia, urging the president to revise the EPA\u2019s carbon dioxide limits for new power plants because it imposed commercially unproven carbon capture technology. Both Pryor and Warner have also both voiced concerns over the EPA\u2019s latest salvo against coal plants, which requires existing power plants to reduce emissions 30 percent by 2030. \u201cI have serious concerns that the EPA\u2019s proposal will undermine the affordable and reliable electricity Arkansans currently enjoy,\u201d Pryor said in a statement. \u201cI will continue to speak with Arkansas stakeholders to gauge how this rule could impact our state\u2019s economy and jobs.\u201d \u201cVirginia is at the center of the national debate on climate change, with our coalfields in southwest Virginia and the Commonwealth\u2019s coastal cities beginning to see the impact of sea rise,\u201d Warner echoed in a statement. \u201cThese draft regulations on existing source carbon power plant emissions are complicated, consequential and far-reaching, and I am pleased the Administration wisely decided to accept our recommendation to double the comment period from 60 to 120 days.\u201d \u201cThis is a first step in a very long process, and it is important that Virginians have a full and fair opportunity to express their views on the proposed rule,\u201d Warner added. \u201cI will review the EPA proposal and consult with a broad variety of Virginia stakeholders on these issues.\u201d","articles_date":"04 06 2014","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2014\/06\/03\/vulnerable-democrats-fight-epas-co2-emissions-rule.html","articles_title":"Vulnerable Democrats fight EPA emissions rule","candidate_fk":3,"first_name":"Evan","id":354,"issue":1,"last_name":"Jenkins","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"The legacy of the Hatfields vs. the McCoys looms large in Mingo County, West Virginia.  Now, in the same mountainous county along the Kentucky state line where blood was spilled and lives were lost in the famed feud nearly a century ago, two new sides are squaring off over serious allegations of repeated sexual assault on two schoolgirls by two male classmates. And there are claims of sham investigations and \"punishment\" that in one case allegedly amounted to  denying the accused an ice-cream break. The case moved behind closed doors Friday at the Mingo County courthouse, where two school district officials and four faculty members made their first appearance in a courtroom for a hearing a week after the state's top lawyer accused them in a civil complaint of concealing alleged sexual abuse at a Mingo County middle school.  West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a request for a civil injunction last week in which he alleges that two female students were victims of sexual assaults over the course of the year at the hands of two seventh-grade boys. According to the filing, abuse of the two 13-year-old Burch Middle School students, also in the seventh grade, took place on multiple occasions between November 2012 and May 2013.  The attorney general says in the filing that two boys would work in concert: one would restrain their victim while the other groped her \"breasts, genitalia (and) buttocks.\"   Most of the alleged attacks Morrisey outlines in the filing took place at the school, except for a class trip to the state capital of Charleston, where one of the girls said she was raped. Names of neither the boys nor the girls have been released, but the attorney general's court filing identifies the suspects as Juvenile 1 and Juvenile 2, and states they are both relatives of employees of the Mingo County school system. Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney Teresa Maynard told CNN that she first learned of the investigation last week after Morrisey filed the request for an injunction. She said she met with the attorney general on Friday and explained to him that her office must be part of the investigation from now on -- and it didn't take her very long to show that she meant it: Maynard filed juvenile charges against both of the boys on Friday.  She would not divulge what those charges were. Maynard has not brought charges against any other parties, but the attorney general did name a handful of teachers and administrators as defendants in the court filing requesting a civil injunction   -- which is not to be confused with the filing of criminal charges.  Attorney General Morrisey declined to be interviewed for this article, but West Virginia State Police Public Information Officer Lt. Mike Baylous explained that a civil injunction -- like the one requested by Morrisey in this case -- is an \"extreme\" court order that is made for the purpose of restraining the defendant -- or in this case, the defendants - from pursuing any conduct that amounts to harassment.  The attorney general made the case in his complaint that he has ample reason to believe that a state investigation would be stymied.  As abhorrent as the allegations are themselves, Morrissey says they are not why he is taking this action; he's doing that because, he said   \"the overall handling of the allegations was inherently flawed and tainted with conflicts of interest.\"  That may seem like an understatement in a 32-page complaint that details allegations of disappearing evidence, connected suspects, sham investigations, deceitful and vengeful administrators, and refusals to cooperate with law enforcement.  Mingo County, going back to the Hatfield-McCoy days, has earned an unsavory reputation, thanks to nepotism, cronyism and a spectacular history of vendettas and public corruption. In the last few years Mingo's sheriff was assassinated, its only circuit judge and prosecutor both went to prison on conspiracy charges in an unrelated case, and a county commissioner pleaded guilty to extortion. Just this week, the mayor of the county's largest city pleaded guilty to lying to federal authorities in a workers' compensation case .  Not even the Mingo school system seems to be immune from controversy.  Court filings cite repeated examples of school officials allegedly protecting the accused in the seventh-grade sexual assault allegations, and claim that \"a relative of (one of the boys) was directly involved in the handling and investigation into the allegations against (him), and involved in decisions relating to the discipline\/punishment of the male juvenile offenders.\"  That investigation, according to Morrisey's injunction request, was \"ineffective, non-existent, (and) designed (to) illicit contradictory and\/or less incriminating statements from the female victims.\" When punishment was doled out, the attorney general characterized it as a mockery. In one instance, for example, a school official \"'disciplined' (the boys) for the alleged abuse of a female student by denying them a break for ice cream during statewide testing,\" the attorney general's court filing said. The attorney general says the problems go beyond alleged efforts to sweep the accusations under the carpet. Morrisey's complaint said Burch Middle School teachers and administrators \"threatened (the girls) with discipline\" to dissuade them from coming forward, and the alleged victims   were retaliated against when they did.  The day after one of the alleged victims alerted state police in April 2014, she was written up for bullying. Morrisey wrote that the \"bullying\" was actually the victim blocking her Facebook account from the niece of a teacher at the school.  The next day she was written up again, this time for \"insubordination,\" according to the filing.   The attorney general alleges that the other victim says she was targeted as well: the injunction request states that a high-ranking Burch official \"retaliated against (her) by removing her from her classes and placing her in other classes that were below her academic level.\"  When West Virginia State Police showed up at Burch on April 24, the principal refused to allow a trooper   to take a statement from a possible third victim, according to the court filing. The principal \"went an additional step further and informed the State Trooper investigating the alleged sexual abuse at the school that he could no longer take statements from students at Burch Middle School because it 'disrupted the learning environment.'\"  CNN tried repeatedly to reach the teachers and administrators at Burch Middle School named in the filing for comment on the allegations, but multiple e-mails and phone messages were never returned. Jason Long, the attorney representing the Mingo County Board of Education and the Mingo County school superintendent, released a statement that said \"the Mingo County Board of Education is committed to working with the attorney general's office to resolve this investigation in a timely manner. The hearing today gathered everyone involved and opened a dialogue. We take these allegations very seriously. Be assured our goal is to create a safe learning environment for all students of Mingo County.\"  ","articles_date":"16 5 2014","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2014\/05\/16\/us\/west-virginia-school-controversy\/index.html","articles_title":"W.

The frozen, acrimonious politics of Capitol Hill and the antagonism of a White House that knows only how to attack were exposed Thursday as Americans tried to process the horror of kids mercilessly killed in yet another school massacre. Then, in another dereliction of duty,  lawmakers and the Trump administration combined  on another abject failure -- to deal humanely with the hundreds of thousands of people, brought illegally to the country as kids. It was the latest great fail over the last three administrations by Congress to reform the immigration system -- amid differences apparently too poisonous to be bridged -- and left senators shaking their heads and wondering where to go next. Neither the misery of those bereaved by the Florida school massacre nor the agony of the Dreamers could shake Washington's warring politicians from the entrenched positions of a dispiriting era devoid of the compromise meant to grease American governance and actually make things work. The most searing image of the day came as the mother of a young girl gunned down in her classroom on Wednesday, tortured by grief, berated President Donald Trump in an extraordinary moment on CNN. \"President Trump, please do something! Do something. Action! We need it now! These kids need safety now!\" Lori Alhadeff screamed. \"President Trump, you say what can you do? You can stop the guns from getting into these children's hands,\" she said. \"What can you do? You can do a lot! This is not fair to our families and our children to go to school and have to get killed!\" It was a harrowing cry that did not just encapsulate a mother's grief but was a non-partisan indictment of a political system that appears unable to help many of the people on whom it depends for legitimacy and that is drained of the trademark optimism and can do spirit that made America a superpower. Vacuum of leadership Trump, finally, stepped up to console the nation, nearly 20 hours after the massacre that killed 17 children and staff. He's not yet at ease in the role of the nation's emotional shepherd. But he offered an effective and sometimes moving homily, seeking to bring people together -- even if he could not make sense of the carnage. \"I want you to know that you are never alone and you never will be,\" he told the children of America, who have to go to school and endure active shooter drills and wonder whether they will be coming home at night. \"You have people who care about you, who love you and who will do anything at all to protect you,\" Trump said, in remarks that were touching in part because they were such a departure from his normal acerbic tone. But Trump left a vacuum of leadership because he was unable to answer the question of people like Alhadeff. He only offered a vague pledge to make schools safer, and to tackle mental health -- but by omitting to even mention the nation's guns laws, made clear that any objective consideration of any necessary changes is off the table. The President had already undermined his own ministrations when earlier on Thursday he indulged in a characteristic blame shifting exercise, singling out the residents of ill-starred Broward County. \"So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior,\" Trump tweeted. \"Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\" Republicans control all the power in Washington. So they for now must take most of the blame for the paralyzing dysfunction. As incumbents they could pay a price in November's midterm elections, yet since the nation is so split, the polls may simply end up solidifying the polarization. The problem is deeper than any one party or any one leader, following several decades where each side has run in elections and governed for their base and major legislation gets jammed through on party-line votes. Coastal liberals, meanwhile, have often seemed to look down on those who do no share their progressive inclinations -- and cling to \"guns or religion\" as Barack Obama once put it -- so are partly to blame for the political distemper that led to Trump's anti-establishment blitzkrieg. No new thinking Still, anyone who had hoped that new horror would promote new thinking and a burying of partisan differences was disappointed on Thursday. Conservatives like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and House Speaker Paul Ryan were quick to warn that Democrats must not use the tragedy to think about depriving anyone of their Second Amendment rights. \"This is one of those moments where we just need to step back and count our blessings,\" Ryan said, before making it clear that the solutions that Democrats might offer, more gun control or background checks were not acceptable. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio maintained that gun restrictions could not have prevented Wednesday's bloodbaths -- remarks that will raise eyebrows abroad, where firearms are hard to come by and school massacres are rare. The White House noticeably canceled its briefing for the second straight day Thursday, sparing itself questions about exactly how it was going to implement what officials said was a \"plan that works\" to stop school shootings. After the Las Vegas massacre that killed 58 people last year, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had rebuked reporters, saying there was a \"time and a place for a political debate\" about guns, but not right after an attack. Democrats slipped into their usual rituals after a mass shooting, questioning why anyone would need a gun so powerful that it can wipe out innocents in an instant. \"Children are dying in our schools, in our communities, on our streets. All this Congress has to say is, 'Let's have a moment of silence,' \" said Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein voiced frustration at a system that cannot agree to do anything after regular gun massacres. \"Doing nothing is not the answer -- there will just be more,\" she said. No one says fixing gun violence will be easy or that anyone on either side has all the right answers. It's easy to call for secure schools -- much harder to do it. The often sprawling buildings with multiple exits, where pupils can simply be sitting ducks would require a massive building program of fortresses along the lines of terror proof US embassies abroad. There seems to be little appetite in Washington to fund such an undertaking. But the message from Thursday was that Washington's politicians don't trust one another enough to even try -- and that might be the worst thing of all. Sense of despair On immigration, there was a similar sense of despair from those who have tried for years to soothe a a national fault line. \"I don't know where we go from here,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, an immigration reform advocate. The spectacle of utter futility was if anything more infuriating than the impasse on how to stem the rash of mass shootings. The administration, turning scorching fire on Republicans seeking compromise defeated a bipartisan attempt to shield Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipients in exchange for funding for the President's border wall. But the administration's own hardline plan, which would have overhauled legal immigration as well, tumbled to an even more stinging defeat. So the White House killed a potentially workable compromise but has no way to advance its own proposal bringing a crucial debate -- with Dreamers at risk of losing their right to work and study in the US -- crashing to a halt. Several Republican senators, including Susan Collins of Maine, were left fuming after the White House scuttled the compromise bill. When he was taking about the Florida massacre, Trump sought to bring the country together, but he could have been talking about immigration, too. \"It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make that difference,\" said the President. It's anyone's guess how.","articles_date":"16 2 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/16\/politics\/donald-trump-immigration-florida-shooting-washington\/index.html","articles_title":"Washington's political impotence is on full display","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":356,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"The top tier candidates in West Virginia\u2019s Republican Senate primary sparred in Tuesday\u2019s Fox News Channel debate over who is most conservative and more closely aligned to President Trump, while blasting Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.

WEST VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN SENATE RACE: A LOOK AT THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES The West Virginia Senate race is considered a toss-up in the midterm elections. Republicans hope to unseat incumbent Joe Manchin, a Democrat who first won the seat in a 2010 special election. The GOP establishment has expressed fear Blankenship's criminal history may jeopardize an opportunity to unseat Manchin. Blakenship, who served a year in prison after being convicted on a conspiracy to violate mine safety standards, defended his actions tied to the 2010 Upper Big Branch mine disaster that killed 29 people and portayed himself as the victim of a \u201cfake prosecution.\u201d \u201cThey sent me to prison for a misdemeanor, I was the only prisoner that was a misdemeanor,\u201d Blankenship said. \u201cIt was clear from the beginning to the end that it was a fake prosecution.\u201d The hour-long debate, which took place at the Metropolitan Theatre in Morgantown, was moderated by Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. Asked if he accepts responsibility for the deaths of the miners, Blankenship said, \u201cI am accepting the responsibility to do everything I can to keep it from happening again.\u201d Morrisey \u2013 who is originally from New Jersey and previously ran for office there -- defended himself against charges of carpetbagging. \u201cI feel very fortunate that I am one of the folks up here who moved to the states by choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI love West Virginia with all of the fiber in my being.\u201d Like the others, Morrisey portrayed himself as the true conservative in the race. \u201cI think it is very clear of all of the candidates on the stage, I am actually the only one with a conservative record of results,\u201d the attorney general said, noting his past efforts to sue the Obama administration over coal. Jenkins and Morrisey dueled throughout the debate, with Jenkins at one point accusing Morrisey of being a hindrance to solving the opioid problem in the state. \u201cIf you want to see what the problem is, it is the pill-pushers and Patrick Morrisey is representing those people for years and made millions,\u201d Jenkins said. But Morrisey shot back: \u201cThere he goes yet again. Did your mom ever tell you that we should wash your mouth out with soap with those lies?\u201d One thing all three candidates agreed on: blasting the special counsel investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s ties with Russia. \u201cWith respect to the Mueller investigation, I think it needs to come to an end,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cIt's a witch hunt. We need to stop that.\u201d \u201cEnd this investigation now,\u201d Jenkins said. Blankenship, who spent a year in prison, quipped that he has \u201chad a little personal experience\u201d with the Justice Department. He said, \u201cthey lie a lot too.\u201d Jenkins, who leads the field of Republicans according to polling, has been a congressman for three years and served as a state senator in West Virginia for 12 years. Morrisey is the first Republican to serve as attorney general in the state since 1933. Blankenship was chairman and CEO of the Massey Energy Company. Manchin is not running unopposed; he races a primary challenger in Paula Jean Swearengin, an environmental activist whose platform is more in line with Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont. Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 40 points in the Mountain State in the 2016 presidential election. The state has long been considered a prime pickup opportunity for Republicans, who hold a two-seat Senate majority that suddenly feels less secure given signs of Democratic momentum in Nevada, Arizona, Tennessee and elsewhere. If Democrats can win West Virginia, which gave Trump his largest margin of victory in the nation, they may have a slim chance at seizing the Senate majority.","articles_date":"1 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2018\/05\/01\/west-virginia-gop-senate-candidates-spar-over-credentials-support-for-trump-in-fox-news-debate.html","articles_title":"West Virginia GOP Senate candidates spar over credentials, support for Trump in Fox News debate","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":357,"issue":8,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Fox News","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"In the biggest settlement ever reached in a U.S. mining disaster, the new owners of the West Virginia coal mine where 29 men were killed in an explosion agreed Tuesday to pay $210 million over a tragedy the government blamed on the ruthless pursuit of profits ahead of safety. ADVERTISEMENT The money will go to compensate the grieving families, bankroll cutting-edge safety improvements and pay for years of violations by Massey Energy, owner of the Upper Big Branch mine at the time of the April 2010 blast. Under the deal, Alpha Natural Resources -- which bought Massey earlier this year -- will face no criminal charges in the explosion as long as it abides by the settlement, U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said. But \"no individuals are off the hook,\" Goodwin warned, adding that federal prosecutors are still investigating former Massey managers. Charges have been brought against only one person so far: the mine's former security chief, Hughie Elbert Stover. A federal jury convicted him last month of lying to investigators and trying to destroy mine records. He is awaiting sentencing. The settlement was bitterly criticized by some of the dead men's relatives, who said they won't be satisfied until charges are filed against those they consider responsible for the catastrophe, the nation's deadliest mine accident in 40 years. Gary Quarles, whose son Gary Wayne Quarles died in the disaster, said: \"I want to hear names, and I want to know what they're going to be charged for. Today would have been a fine day for them to have told us.\" Hours after the settlement was announced, the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration released a final report on the blast that detailed 369 safety violations at Upper Big Branch, including 12 it said contributed to the explosion. MSHA labeled nine of the violations that led to the accident as flagrant, the most serious designation, and said they included illegally tipping off miners that inspectors were on the site and failing to conduct proper safety inspections. \"The physical conditions that led to the explosion were the result of a series of basic safety violations at UBB and were entirely preventable,\" the report said. The report confirmed what the agency and other investigators said previously: that Massey allowed a buildup of highly explosive methane gas and combustible coal dust, and that worn and broken cutting equipment created the spark that ignited the fuel. Also, investigators said broken water sprayers allowed a mere flare-up to turn into an inferno that ripped through miles of underground tunnels and killed men instantly. \"Every time Massey sent miners into the UBB Mine, Massey put those miners' lives at risk,\" said MSHA director Joe Main. \"Massey management created a culture of fear and intimidation in their miners to hide their reckless practices. Today's report brings to light the tragic consequences of a corporate culture that values production over people.\" The settlement consists of $46.5 million in restitution to the miners' families, $128 million for safety improvements, research and training, and $35 million in fines for safety violations at Upper Big Branch and other Massey mines. The deal seeks to guarantee that the families of the 29 dead miners and two co-workers who survived the explosion will each receive $1.5 million. Those who accept the payout can still pursue lawsuits, but the $1.5 million will be deducted from any settlement or jury award. At least eight families of dead miners previously settled with Massey. Alpha CEO Kevin Crutchfield said the company cooperated fully with authorities and believes the agreement represents \"the best path forward for everyone.\" \"We're particularly pleased that a substantial portion of the settlement is going towards furthering miner safety, which has always been Alpha's guiding principle,\" he said. The deal was seen as precedent-setting, not just because of the amount of money, but because a lot of it is going toward research that could make mining safer. It was also seen as an attempt by Alpha to put the scandal behind it. \"Alpha definitely knows they had a problem. Whenever they bought Massey, they bought all of Massey's older problems,\" said Bruce Dial, who runs a mine consulting company out of Pineville, N.C. \"This is their way of saying, `Massey did this, we bought Massey, let's settle up and start new.\"' Well before the disaster, Massey had a poor safety record, and the coal company and its hard-nosed CEO, Don Blankenship, had a reputation among their union critics for treating fines as the cost of doing business. MSHA said its investigation found \"systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts\" by Massey to cover up problems, including keeping two sets of inspection books -- an accurate one for itself, and a fake one for regulators. The federal agency also said it will conduct an internal review of its own actions at Upper Big Branch. Relatives of the victims and officials with the United Mine Workers union have rebuked MSHA for not shutting down the mine before the tragedy. Under Tuesday's settlement, Virginia-based Alpha will invest $48 million in a mine-safety research trust and spend an additional $80 million to improve safety at all of its mines with the latest technology. The improvements will include coating mines with crushed limestone to reduce the risk of a coal-dust explosion; using digital sensors to continuously monitor air flow and methane levels; and adopting emergency oxygen equipment, similar to what firefighters rely on, to give miners an uninterrupted supply of air while trying to escape from an underground accident. \"This in several ways is a revolutionary resolution,\" Goodwin said. \"We wanted it to be something constructive and forward-looking.\" Clay Mullins, whose brother Rex died in the mine, said he wants to see criminal charges brought against executives at Massey, not just against low- and mid-level managers. \"It was an act of murder,\" he said. \"They murdered 29 men, and I'm not satisfied one bit.\" Mullins said he also believes MSHA bears some responsibility. MSHA coal administrator Kevin Stricklin defended the agency, saying that his inspectors shut the mine down 48 times in the year before the blast but had to allow it to reopen when problems were fixed. He said MSHA lacked the authority to close it permanently and still does. \"We thought we were keeping accidents from happening,\" he said.","articles_date":"06 12 2011","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2011\/12\/06\/west-virginia-mine-disaster-reportedly-yields-210-million-agreement.html","articles_title":"West Virginia Mine Disaster Yields $210 Million Settlement","candidate_fk":1,"first_name":"Don","id":358,"issue":6,"last_name":"Blankenship","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"Considered a toss-up in the midterm elections, the West Virginia Senate race is one where Republicans hope to have the chance to unseat incumbent Joe Manchin, a Democrat who first won the seat in a 2010 special election. According to a Fox News poll, three Republicans are considered to be \u201ctop tier\u201d candidates ahead of the May 8 primary: Don Blankenship, Evan Jenkins and Patrick Morrisey. Jenkins, a U.S. congressman, topped the list of Republican contenders. These three candidates will face off in a Fox News debate on May 1. Manchin is not running unopposed; he races a primary challenger in Paula Jean Swearengin, an environmental activist whose platform is more in line with Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont. President Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 40 points in the Mountain State in the 2016 presidential election. From their focus on former President Barack Obama\u2019s policies to their courtship of coal workers, here\u2019s a look at the top three Republicans competing for the GOP nomination. Don Blankenship Don Blankenship, 68, was imprisoned in a federal jail for a year in 2016 after he was convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety and health standards -- and he\u2019s still fighting the conviction, blaming the Obama administration every step of the way. Blankenship, the former head of Massey Energy Company, calls the 2010 explosion that killed 29 people at the company\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine the \u201cworst tragedy of my life.\u201d Blankenship has sought to have his conviction thrown out, and he\u2019s promoted a pamphlet he wrote in prison that he said sheds light on his prosecution, the explosion and an Obama administration conspiracy against him. He\u2019s also compared the tragedy to that of the 2012 Benghazi attack, calling the blast \u201cObama\u2019s deadliest cover-up\u201d in a campaign ad. He\u2019s been called the \u201cvillain of our times,\u201d compared to failed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and dubbed \u201cthe most hated man in West Virginia.\u201d He\u2019s also been the nearly $745,000 target of the Mountain Families PAC which opposes his Senate campaign. Despite running for Senate in West Virginia, his primary residence, according to The New York Times, is a $2.4 million home near Las Vegas. As a candidate, Blankenship has a goal of hosting town hall meetings in every one of West Virginia's 55 counties, according to Politico Magazine. He\u2019s resonating with voters such as Rev. Becky Deitch, the chairwoman of the Brooke County GOP who told Politico, \u201cThe common man doesn\u2019t want another politician. I could tell from his handshake. He\u2019s real.\u201d \u201cI think the big issue in West Virginia is jobs, and I\u2019m the guy that created a lot of jobs in West Virginia and neither of my \u2026 opponents did,\u201d Blankenship told Fox News. He also said he\u2019s \u201cbetter positioned\u201d to deal with the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic that has hit West Virginia particularly hard since his company dealt with workers who struggled with drugs. A supporter of Trump, Blankenship advocates for building a border wall and ending so-called sanctuary cities. Blankenship got into some hot water during his campaign when he said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s father-in-law is a \u201cwealthy China person.\u201d McConnell has been married to Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, since 1993. Blankenship denied the comment was a \u201ctarget on his family,\u201d but rather an \u201cobservation that Mitch\u2019s family is very well-connected in China.\u201d In Fox News' poll of Republican Senate candidates, Blankenship came in third with 16 percent of likely voters saying they would select him. Still, 24 percent of voters remain undecided, according to the poll. Evan Jenkins Rep. Evan Jenkins has been a congressman for only three years, but before that, he served as a state senator in West Virginia for 12 years. Jobs, coal, senior citizens and the Second Amendment are all important issues to Jenkins, according to his campaign website. He also focused on his anti-abortion record in his first television advertisement. Jenkins, 57, helped create the nonprofit Lily\u2019s Place, a facility that cares for newborns who are born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which occurs when babies are exposed to drugs while still in the womb. Jenkins has made a point in his campaign to distance Manchin, one of the more conservative Democrats in Washington, from Trump. However, Jenkins, too, used to be a Democrat. He switched to the GOP in 2013. But that wasn\u2019t his only party switch; Jenkins was a registered Republican until 1993, according to Roll Call. As for jobs, Jenkins stressed the importance of coal growing the local economy in an interview with the Herald-Dispatch. He said he\u2019s worked with Trump on easing Obama-era regulations on the coal industry and has supported additional funding for clinics and healthcare services for miners who suffer from \u201cblack lung disease.\u201d Jenkins told Fox News West Virginia needs a \u201cnew voice\u201d to represent the state in the U.S. Senate. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear choice,\u201d Jenkins said of the race. He accused Blankenship of \u201cusing his checkbook\u201d to launch a \u201cvendetta\u201d campaign that\u2019s all about his name. As for the state attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, another Senate candidate, Jenkins called him \u201cdeeply flawed,\u201d \u201cin the swamp\u201d and for the opioid industry. Jenkins has also stressed during the campaign that he supported Trump in the presidential primary, as opposed to the other candidates.  \"We're starting to see hope and opportunity come back to West Virginia,\" Jenkins told Fox News, saying voters want someone \"who's getting the job done, working with President Trump, bringing this renewed sense of confidence as proud West Virginians.\" Jenkins leads the field of Republicans in Fox News' poll with 25 percent of likely voters saying they support him. However, 24 percent of voters are still undecided. Patrick Morrisey Patrick Morrisey is the first Republican to serve as attorney general in West Virginia since 1933, his campaign website boasts. First elected to serve in the position in 2012, he was re-elected in 2016. Now Morrisey has his sights set on the U.S. Senate. In his campaign, Morrisey, 50, has harped on his efforts as attorney general to curtail the state\u2019s opioid epidemic. He sued the Drug Enforcement Administration, saying it allows companies to not take into account patients\u2019 needs when selling drugs. And his office has reached settlements with pharmaceutical distributors for about $47 million, the largest in the state\u2019s history, according to his campaign website. But his past work as a health care attorney and his wife\u2019s work as a lobbyist who has represented several pharmaceutical clients, including those involved in opioids, have come under scrutiny. His wife\u2019s lobbying firm was also paid $460,000 by Planned Parenthood, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported last year. Morrisey has said he is staunchly anti-abortion, opposing taxpayer dollars going to Planned Parenthood and supporting repealing Roe v. Wade. In an interview with Fox News, Morrisey said he's worked with Trump to get rid of some Obama administration regulations and to \"go after\" sanctuary cities. He said he has an \"excellent\" relationship with the president.  \"As voters focus the last two weeks, they're going to learn who is the proven conservative,\" Morrisey said, calling Jenkins a \"political opportunist\" who \"stands for nothing.\"  Morrisey has been endorsed by the conservative National Review, which heralded him as a \u201crock-solid, independent-minded conservative who would be a valuable addition to the right flank of the Republican caucus.\u201d Morrisey has also been endorsed by Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. He is just behind Jenkins, according to Fox News' poll, with 21 percent of likely voters throwing their support behind the attorney general.

Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, echoing a point several of her colleagues made last week in the run-up to Trump's speech.  Democrats who spoke to CNN also wanted to hear about policy issues -- in particular, addressing those affected by the  expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program , as well as looking for a plan on infrastructure -- but a common theme among their requests was highlighting the President's tone.  Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island said Democrats were hoping for a starkly different speech from Trump's inaugural address, which he called \"very much divisive rather than unifying.\"  His colleague Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said he has \"a lot of worries\" about Trump's address, because, \"His big speeches have often been filled with things that don't reflect our highest values or our common aspirations as a country.\"  And Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware agreed that he would like to hear \"something positive about bipartisanship and problem-solving.\" \"Donald Trump lost by nearly 3 million votes,\" said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont. \"I think the country would find it refreshing if he stopped bragging about himself and started talking about the country and bringing us all together.\"  Leahy cited the example of President George W. Bush, who lost the popular vote to Al Gore and then used his first State of the Union to give a \"really good speech trying to bring everybody together.\" In interviews at the Capitol, several Democratic senators said they saw repair of the nation's crumbling infrastructure as an area where Trump could find common ground between Democrats and Republicans. \"We need to rebuild America, so that would be something positive,\" said Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. She said she was sure Trump would \"tell us how great everything is,\" but that she hoped he offered a realistic and robust plan for fixing roads, bridges, airports and other public works. But, she said, it needs to be more than \"just public-private partnerships that will create tolls,\" an approach she said would be ineffective in her state. \"An infrastructure plan would bring the nation together,\" Feinstein said. \"But it needs specifics -- how it would be funded, how it would be formed, what kind of projects, that kind of thing.\" Some Democrats said they hoped Trump will follow through with his most recent promises on immigration. The White House is set to unveil an immigration plan on Monday, just ahead of Tuesday's speech, after Trump  proposed giving 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants a  pathway to citizenship in exchange for $25 billion for a wall along the Mexican border and several other strict immigration reforms. \"I'm more thinking about Monday night than Tuesday night,\" Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said, echoing several lawmakers. \"I want to hear what he has to say about immigration.\" But among Democratic senators, a year's worth of skepticism and tensions with Trump were clear.  Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware said, \"I would like for him to promise that he is going to be more consistent, and change his mind less frequently,\" citing Trump's treatment of DACA recipients as an example of inconsistent stances. He added, \"I'd like to hear him say that he was wrong on climate change, that it's real, that humans contribute to it. And that there is a great economic opportunity in addressing it now.\" Carper said he wants Trump to apologize for \"denigrating other people whose views he doesn't agree with,\" and wants him to say: \"I realize I don't build myself up by tearing other people down. I promise not to do that again.\" \"I would stand and applaud for all of that stuff. Hopefully it'll happen,\" Carper said. \"It's my wish list.\" \"In 2016 he promised that Americans were going to get better, more affordable health care,\" Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said, and that he was going to fight to bring down prescription drug prices.  Instead, Americans have been seeing the \"politics of health care discrimination,\" Wyden said. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democrats, also said he thought Trump needed to use the speech to make amends.  \"I want an apology from the President, who is trying to divide this country up based on race, national origin, gender and sexual orientation,\" he said.

First, though, he wants to help \"young, progressive Democrats\" get elected -- maybe even to the Senate -- in his home state of Texas. Only after November will the 43-year-old Latino, whose twin brother, Joaquin, is in Congress, decide on his political future. The former San Antonio mayor and Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Barack Obama launched the Opportunity First PAC as a vehicle for his political activity. He is set to make his first trip to an early voting state on February 16, when he'll be in Manchester to speak to New Hampshire Young Democrats.  CNN caught up with Castro after he spoke at an event at American University in Washington on Thursday. Here's what he said:  On running for President in 2020:  \"Yeah, I'm interested, but whether or not I end up doing it -- I'll decide that later.\" When will he decide? \"I have not decided to run. I'm going to take these next few months of the 2018 cycle helping young, progressive Democrats running across the country get elected. ... And then after that, after the November election, I'll make a decision by the end of 2018 about my own future. But during these next few months, I'm going to have a lot of chance to get across the country and listen to what folks are saying and get a sense of what people are thinking.\"  On visits to states like New Hampshire: \"Part of making a decision will be understanding those states better, spending time there.\" How he'll prepare for his 2020 decision: \"Everybody's focus right now seems to be on 2018 for very good reason, and my focus is on 2018. But anybody who's thinking about running in 2020 is also, I would imagine, at least going through what that kind of race looks like. ... And what happens this November will probably impact the field that you see in 2020, too. Those two things are related.\"  His 2018 plans: \"I'm going to focus the vast majority of my attention on supporting great candidates all across Texas and across the United States. ... We've started to get requests at Opportunity First from people throughout the United States. My number one priority is doing what we can to build a great bench of young, progressive Democrats.\"  Is Texas winnable for Democrats? \"Texas had the highest jump toward the Democrats in the 2016 election, toward Secretary Clinton. I expect that in the Texas House of Representatives, Democrats will pick up perhaps 10 seats, maybe a state Senate seat or two, and that (the Democratic Senate candidate, Rep.) Beto O'Rourke runs right now a decent shot at beating Ted Cruz, which would be earth-shattering down there in Texas...  \"It's the same abandonment of Trump by people in the suburbs that you saw in Northern Virginia (and Alabama). ... That's happening in the suburbs of Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio. So it's not just sort of the two-dimensional demographic question we think about in terms of the Latino community. It's also that you have folks in these big-city suburbs that used to be moderate Republicans that, more and more in Texas, have become independents or Democrats.

All, right now, on a special edition of \"Fox News Sunday.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: \u00a0You are looking live at the Wells Fargo Center, home of the Philadelphia Flyers and the 76ers, and this week, site of the Democratic convention. \u00a0Starting tomorrow, this hall will be filled with more than 4,700 delegates as the Democrats nominate Hillary Clinton for president. \u00a0 And hello again today from the Fox News sky box. \u00a0From this vantage box, we'll watch Clinton make history as the first woman to top a major party ticket. \u00a0We'll also hear from a roster of headliners, President and Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton and Chelsea Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Clinton's new running mate, Tim Kaine. \u00a0 What message do Democrats hope to send voters this week? Joining me, the chief strategist, Joel Benenson. \u00a0 And, Joel, welcome to \"Fox News Sunday.\" JOEL BENENSON, CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHIEF STRATEGIST: \u00a0Chris, thanks for having me. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Let's start with the big news this weekend. \u00a0Why Tim Kaine? \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0Well, I think Hillary Clinton made it clear from the beginning her number one priority was to pick a vice-president who was ready to do all parts of the job of president. \u00a0Tim Kaine has that experience. \u00a0He\u2019s been a mayor, a governor, a senator, on the Armed Services Committee. \u00a0He brings that part of the package. \u00a0 The other piece that's important, she wants a real partner who can help her produce the real results that are going to make a real difference in people's lives. \u00a0That\u2019s going to be key to this campaign. \u00a0American people want action. \u00a0They want their economic lives uplifted. \u00a0Tim Kaine brings the same values to the job that she does. \u00a0And that would be a very powerful combination in trying to get Washington working for working people again. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0But there are some real differences on issues between Clinton and Kaine, and I want to go through them. \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0Sure. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Kaine praised TPP, the Pacific trade deal, Clinton opposes it. \u00a0Kaine wants to ease some regulations of banks under Dodd-Frank. \u00a0He supports the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of federal Medicaid funds for abortion, and as governor, he backed requiring parental consent for minors seeking abortion. \u00a0Those are some differences. BENENSON: \u00a0Yes. \u00a0There are some differences, in their conversations, they talked through those differences. \u00a0And when you talk about Tim Kaine, keep in mind, he raised some issues. \u00a0He\u2019s got 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood and NARAL. \u00a0He is a Catholic, a practicing Catholic and he is personally said he\u2019s opposed to abortion. \u00a0But he\u2019s also said Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and it shouldn\u2019t be changed, and he has been 100 percent for protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose and right to her own health care. \u00a0 On some of these other issues, like TPP, Hillary Clinton is confirmed in her choice that her criteria for trade deals being met that they have to protect American workers, protect jobs, make sure that they don't reduce wages, that they raise wages in America, protect our national security. \u00a0She is confident that Tim Kaine is in line with her on making sure any trade deal at this administration engages in will meet those criteria. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0But let me pick up on that because -- BENENSON: \u00a0Sure. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0-- this is the kind of thing that I think a lot people don't like about politicians. \u00a0Just three days ago, here is what Tim Kaine said about TPP, the Pacific trade deal. \u00a0He said, \"I see much in it to like.\" \u00a0Yesterday, after Clinton named him, he suddenly announced he\u2019s opposed to TPP. \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0Look, but Hillary Clinton said they were things she liked about it too along the way. \u00a0You\u2019ve got to remember, things change in the final provisions, Chris, that were critically negative towards American interests. \u00a0Notably, one big one, the nation of origins provision, changes who has to own how much of a business to qualify as a Vietnamese company or Malaysian company. \u00a0 So, I think there\u2019s any inconsistency there. \u00a0Nobody said this thing is terrible in every I and T that\u2019s been dotted and crossed. \u00a0There were things in it that were good for a while, and Hillary Clinton thought and talked about them. \u00a0And then at the end of the deal, it didn't meet her tests. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0All right, let's talk about the other big issue as we get into the convention, and I suspect you know what I\u2019m going to talk about. \u00a0Some Bernie Sanders supporters upset about Kaine because they think he is too centrist, but what they're really upset about was a WikiLeaks release on Friday of thousands of DNC e-mails which seem to show that the DNC was favoring Clinton over Sanders. \u00a0We want to put some of those e-mails up on the screen. \u00a0 In early May, the DNC's finance chief for Kentucky and West Virginia, \"Can we get someone to ask his belief. \u00a0Does he believe in a God, he had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. \u00a0I think read he is an atheist.\" In late May, a Democratic spokesman suggested pushing a story that Sanders never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess. \u00a0 And responding to Sanders criticism in April, DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz wrote, \"Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party.\" Now, we have talked to some people on the Sanders camp. \u00a0They\u2019re furious. \u00a0Trump is tweeting out, maybe there\u2019s going to be a Philly fight. \u00a0And there is also a report now that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is not going to speak at this convention. \u00a0 First of all, is that true? \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0Well, I saw the same report you said. \u00a0I\u2019ve been sitting here with you for the last few minutes, so I can't give a definitive answer on that. \u00a0 As for the other things, you know, first of all, I believe the gentleman who sent that e-mail has apologized -- WALLACE: \u00a0The one about Sanders\u2019 religion. BENENSON: \u00a0And I want to make very clear, Hillary Clinton has been a woman of faith her whole life. \u00a0She was raised a Methodist, believes very strongly in the creed of her faith. \u00a0We don't believe anybody's religion should ever be an issue in any campaign. \u00a0Absolutely not. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0How about the larger issue, Joel, just the idea that all of this seems to show, not just one but all three e-mails, and there were others, that the DNC had its thumb on the scale favoring Clinton over Sanders? \u00a0Which is what the Sanders folks said all along. (CROSSTALK) BENENSON: \u00a0Let's keep in mind what happened here. \u00a0Most experts on cybersecurity say it is a hack by bad actors in concert with Russia, and working in concert with Russia. \u00a0We don't know what is in 20,000 e-mails. \u00a0We know about three e-mails. \u00a0We don't know anything else that's been said inside the DNC. \u00a0 What we know about the course of our primary system is close to 30 million people voted. \u00a0They voted in open primaries. \u00a0We had independence voting. \u00a0We had Democrats voting. \u00a0It was a wide open contest. \u00a0 Thirty million people voted and Hillary Clinton won, vast majority of delegates, 54 percent of delegates. \u00a0She won 54 percent of the vote -- WALLACE: \u00a0I understand she won, but did the DNC have its thumb on the scale. \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0I think the DNC will conduct a full review of all these emails, all these emails that were being apparently selectively leaked by these actors acting in concert with Russia, that\u2019s a serious problem that we have to be concerned with, if they\u2019re trying to meddle in what we believe was a fair and honest election. \u00a0I think there\u2019s no question -- WALLACE: \u00a0You think this is Russia trying -- BENENSON: \u00a0I think when 30 million people vote through the primary system, a near historic number, the second most in history and the ballots were counted at the ballot box, and Hillary Clinton got 16 million votes, the third highest total in history, second only to herself and Barack Obama. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0OK. \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0I think the elections were fair. \u00a0I think that we should wait for the review, the full review of this, and not jump to any conclusions on any sides based -- WALLACE: \u00a0Well, the fact that the finance chair has apologized, to indicate that was an accurate e-mail. \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0Well, if the finance chair apologized, then the finance chair should. \u00a0But the notion of whether the elections were rigged, I think that that, when 30 million people vote and cast their votes. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Let me make it clear: I don\u2019t think the election was rigged. \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0OK, let\u2019s agree. WALLACE: \u00a0But the question is whether the DNC favored Clinton over Sanders. \u00a0It\u2019s a different issue. BENENSON: \u00a0Look, the issue here is these primaries are largely fought out on the ground with voters. \u00a0The DNC's impact in these things is minimal, compared to the results. \u00a0What candidates and campaign spend and do on the ground, talking to voters day in and day out, that's what determines who wins. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Let me just say, incidentally, and we were assured by the DNC that we wouldn't have what happened last week at the RNC, that they wouldn't do sound checks, but every convention we've done, they do sound checks. \u00a0So, if you hear some extraneous noise. \u00a0 One last question on this area: Does Hillary Clinton still have full confidence in Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC chair, and will she stay in her job? \u00a0Can you assure us she will stay in her job through her the election? \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0I honestly have never had a conversation with Hillary Clinton about Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the chair of the Democratic Party. So, that's the honest truth, Chris. \u00a0I\u2019ve never had that conversation. \u00a0 So, I can't sit here and assure of you anything. \u00a0I think that there are reports out today that say she may not speak in the convention. \u00a0That will be up to her and whoever she\u2019s talking to about her role. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0But the Clinton camp hasn't asked for her not to. \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0I haven't engaged in any of those conversations regarding that. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Are you worried this could disrupt the convention? \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0No, I don\u2019t. \u00a0I think we've got a lineup that\u2019s extraordinary. \u00a0 We\u2019ve got as you said in the topic, I think you're going to see a contrast between the disunity, the divisiveness, the anger, and borderline hate coming out of the Republican here. \u00a0I think we\u2019ve got a positive, affirmative message about how we create an economy that works for everybody. \u00a0We\u2019re going to be talking about how the strength of America is in our unity, our diversity, and the fact that we've been at our best when we lift people up, not when -- lift each other up not when we tear each other apart. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0I want to ask you about one controversy about your convention. \u00a0On Thursday night, you're going to feature what is called the Mothers of the Movement, a group of mothers and other victims, relatives of victims of police shootings. \u00a0Why? \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0Well, look, I think these women have been suffered a tragic loss. \u00a0We haven't released our full program yet about the range of things we're talking about, but we've been talking about the need and Hillary Clinton has led the conversation on this, to have both respect for our police, and we've seen tragic shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge, obviously, and respect between communities. \u00a0 And I think people in the police field, law enforcement, agree with that. \u00a0Nobody is happy when the communities and the police are not working together to solve crime. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0But here is -- (CROSSTALK) BENENSON: \u00a0Go ahead. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0I was going to say, here is why I bring it up. \u00a0Philadelphia, this city's police union says it is, quote, \"insulted by the exclusion of police widows and police family members,\" and they say that you're talking to the victims of the shootings, but not to the victims of the police who were assassinated. \u00a0They say when eight cops were assassinated in the last few weeks, why aren't you honoring them? \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0Well, first of all, I respect the police officers in Philadelphia, who like all of our law enforcement officials have a very tough job. \u00a0We haven't released our full program yet. \u00a0As you know, there are many events and speaker, the majority of which have not been released yet. \u00a0That will happen in the forthcoming future. But these women have been on a campaign to talk about the relations between police and their communities. \u00a0The communities that suffer the highest crime in the country, who want to be protected, who know that their law enforcement people are there in their communities to protect them. \u00a0But they're speaking out because they suffered tragic losses of children, husbands, fathers, who have been shot and that's painful for them. \u00a0 And what they're trying to do is take their loss and turn it into activism to be part of the conversation to improve these relations with police and community. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0We've got a couple of minutes left. \u00a0I want to change subjects. \u00a0At his convention last week, Donald Trump, I think you would agree, hammered Hillary Clinton. \u00a0Here is a taste of that. \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: \u00a0This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0Clinton was trailing by eight points among men and by 15 points among whites. \u00a0What does your polling show? \u00a0Honestly, did Donald Trump get any bounce out of his convention? \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0Well, honestly, we haven't polled during his convention -- \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0OK. BENENSON: \u00a0-- because it\u2019s not an opportune time to do that. \u00a0But what I can tell you as an observer and a student not just of conventions and elections, but really of swing voters, that's kind of been my sweet spot as a pollster, Chris. \u00a0 I think your goal at your convention is you have to speak to people who are accessible to you and not with you yet. \u00a0You have to persuade them, and convert them. \u00a0And you have to speak to their values and issues. \u00a0 I think that was a missed opportunity. \u00a0Their chaos, their divisiveness, left those people I think feeling very left out of the Republican Party, just like many Republicans felt left out of the party. \u00a0The governor of the host state not attend. \u00a0You\u2019ve had the past two nominees of the party not attend that convention. \u00a0 They had an opportunity to show some unity, and instead, they showed divisiveness within there speaking about the American people and a divided party at its core right now. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Finally, you look at the numbers, I assume, every day, the numbers you get. \u00a0How close is this race, especially in the swing state? BENENSON: \u00a0We don't poll every day, Chris. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Well, no. \u00a0But -- BENENSON: \u00a0We will at some point, but, you know, just to be clear. \u00a0Look, I think the history of presidential elections is that they\u2019re very close. \u00a0We've only had a handful of presidents who have been elected with 50 percent of the vote on their election and reelection. \u00a0So, you expect these things to be in a kind of, you know, three to six to seven-point range. You know, with President Obama, we won by seven. \u00a0With -- against Senator McCain, against Romney, by about three and a half. \u00a0I think we're going to stay in that range for a long time. \u00a0I think we'll know after the two conventions, where this sits and who got a bounce and who really communicated and made the points with the voters they need to reach better. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0So, in that 3 to 6 point range, where are you right now? \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0We\u2019re in that range. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Where, three, five, seven? \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0Talk to me after the two conventions. \u00a0 (LAUGHTER) WALLACE: \u00a0All right. \u00a0Do me one favor. \u00a0When you leave here now, will you ask them to stop hammering? \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0I'll do my best. \u00a0I\u2019ll do my best. \u00a0But we've got to get the set finished too. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Joel, thank you. \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0Thank you. WALLACE: \u00a0You can wait until 10:00. \u00a0Thanks for coming in on this busy week. \u00a0Have a good convention. \u00a0 BENENSON: \u00a0Thank you. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Up next, the chair of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, and whether his candidate will see a post-convention bounce, as \"Fox News Sunday\" reports live from the Democratic Convention inside Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: \u00a0A look at the iconic Love sculpture outside city hall in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. \u00a0 Well, after the biggest week of his 13 month political career, Donald Trump will take an unaccustomed place on the sideline this week, as the Democrats get the spotlight. \u00a0How did Trump do in Cleveland, and where does the race stand now. \u00a0 Joining me now is Trump's campaign chair, Paul Manafort. \u00a0 Paul, the Clinton\/Kaine ticket had its rollout yesterday and here is what they had to say about the campaign and Donald Trump. \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: \u00a0When he said as he did say, \"I alone can fix it\", he is not only wrong, he is dangerously wrong. \u00a0 KAINE: \u00a0When Donald Trump says he has your back, you better watch out. \u00a0He leaves a trail of broken promises and wrecked lives wherever he goes. \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0Paul, their basic message, Trump doesn't care about regular folks. \u00a0All he cares about is Donald Trump. \u00a0 PAUL MANAFORT, TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN: \u00a0Well, that's the pot calling the kettle black I guess you could say. \u00a0I mean, look, the establishment is represented by Hillary Clinton, and she chose her perfect partner in Senator Kaine. \u00a0 Senator Kaine is the ultimate status quo. \u00a0He\u2019s never had a job in the private sector. \u00a0He\u2019s been mayor, governor, senator. \u00a0He has no idea how to create jobs, nor does Hillary Clinton, and the two of them together are the ultimate of the establishment in the year of change. \u00a0 So, for them to say those things, of course. \u00a0They don't get it. \u00a0 Donald Trump does get it. He was nominated because he understands what's going on in America, and doesn't care what's going on in Washington. \u00a0He is committed to breaking that gridlock. During our convention, that message resonated. Even CNN's polls, sorry, different networks, showed 75 percent who listened to his speech agreed with him and thought he would bring real change. That's over 35 million people listening. \u00a0 So, we're very comfortable that the campaign speaks exactly like we want. \u00a0We're the change candidate. \u00a0Clinton and Kaine are the failed establishment candidate. \u00a0Their record is what we're fighting against. And for them to say they're going bring change, when all the problems were created during the Obama administration, frankly, is ludicrous. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Now, in the strict political sense, Tim Kaine is a white man from a swing state. \u00a0Doesn't he cut into Trump's advantages in some of those areas? \u00a0 MANAFORT: \u00a0Tim Kaine is a failed career politician, who has never had a job in the private sector, and never created jobs. \u00a0His -- WALLACE: \u00a0He failed, he has never lost an election, Paul. \u00a0 MANAFORT: \u00a0Compare his record to Governor Pence. \u00a0 During Kaine's term in office, he tried to raise taxes $4 billion as governor. \u00a0He came in saying he was going to change the transportation system in Virginia. \u00a0He did change it. \u00a0It got worst. \u00a0He -- unemployment went from 3 percent to 7.5 percent. \u00a0 And those are his highlights. \u00a0I mean, Governor Pence cut taxes every one of the years he was governor, brought in new jobs, balanced the budget, has a $2 billion reserve fund. \u00a0And as well as having improved the infrastructure, increase aid for health care and education. \u00a0Those are records of accomplishment. \u00a0So, Tim Kaine may be what he is, but as far as we're concerned, he is the perfect candidate. \u00a0 Bernie Sanders who should be concerned because yes, Tim Kaine doesn't represent the progressive agenda of Sanders, and once again, the progressives in the Democratic Party have been cheated by the establishment. \u00a0But the WikiLeaks of the Democratic emails over the last week proved that was always the plan. \u00a0I\u2019m not surprised. \u00a0We'll see how they take it at their convention. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Are you egging on -- your boss has been talking about a Philly fight. \u00a0Are you egging on the Bernie Sanders supporters and delegates to cause a fuss here at the convention? \u00a0 MANAFORT: \u00a0We don't have to egg them on. \u00a0They have a lot to complain about. \u00a0The e-mails have proven the system was rigged from the start. \u00a0The only reason they\u2019re not the nominee is because of the superdelegates who are the established elected officials in the Democratic Party. \u00a0The fix was in from the beginning. \u00a0 But more importantly, as far as we're concerned, the people who voted for Bernie Sanders, right now, you've got polls out showing less than 55 percent are going to support Hillary Clinton. \u00a0And a number of them, you know, who are against the rigged system, can find support in what Donald Trump has been saying, as far as what he wants to do in breaking up the rigged political system, the rigged economy. \u00a0 If there\u2019s anybody against Wall Street, it\u2019s Donald Trump. \u00a0Not Hillary Clinton, who basically lives off the funding from Wall Street. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Let's talk about your convention and your candidate. \u00a0Democrats are pushing back against Trump's description at the convention of an America in crisis. \u00a0Take a look. \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: \u00a0This idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn't really jive with the experience of most people. \u00a0 CLINTON: \u00a0He offered a lot of fear and anger and resentment, but no solutions about anything that he even talked about. \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0Paul, didn't Trump engage in fear-mongering? \u00a0 MANAFORT: \u00a0Not at all. \u00a0 First of all, Barack Obama is out of touch with America. \u00a0For him to say that people in the country are happy and walking around with sunshine in their face is not a reality. \u00a0I mean, it shows, you know, that he doesn't even get what he has done with this country. \u00a0 Secondly, as far as the Donald Trump speech. \u00a0It was a speech of hope, but the difference between what you're going to hear out of the Democrats in Philadelphia this weekend and what Donald Trump said is he told the truth. \u00a0 He said, look, I recognize your pain. \u00a0I understand it. \u00a0I know things are hard for you. \u00a0I know you can -- you're working two jobs and still barely paying your bills. \u00a0I know you don't like the rising health care costs. \u00a0I know you're afraid to walk the streets, contrary to what President Obama says. \u00a0 And he said, I\u2019m going to be your voice. \u00a0I\u2019m going to be your messenger. \u00a0I\u2019m going to take care of this. \u00a0 And he\u2019s got a track record to prove it. \u00a0To say -- he then offered very specific solutions. \u00a0He talked about his plan to cut taxes. \u00a0He talked about his plan to bring law and order to the community. \u00a0He talked about his anti-terrorist program and keeping terrorists out from geographically dangerous areas. \u00a0 He talked about his energy first plan to make America energy independent. \u00a0He talked about his healthcare plan, his infrastructure plan. \u00a0It\u2019s all in the speech. \u00a0Hillary Clinton needs to just listen to the whole thing. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Well, let's drill down on one area -- here is what Trump said about Clinton's call for a 550 percent increase in the number of Syrian refugees we let into the country. \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: \u00a0She proposes this, despite the fact that there is no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are, or where they come from. \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0But, Paul, that just simply is not true. \u00a0It takes 18 months to two years to screen a single Syrian refugee to come into the country. \u00a0And, in fact, this year, President Obama, so far at least, has only met half of his target of allowing 10,000 Syrian refugees in a year, only about 5,200. \u00a0 MANAFORT: \u00a0First of all, Chris, it is more than just Syrian refugees streaming into the country. \u00a0Donald Trump's point is the following. \u00a0He said, we have to have a system that that\u2019s -- people coming in from dangerous areas, from terrorist historical areas, we don't have one right now. \u00a0We have open borders. \u00a0There\u2019s not -- there is no vetting process, which is why things are dangerous. \u00a0 (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: \u00a0But wait. \u00a0But respectfully, in the case of the Syrians, any Syrian refugee coming into this country is vetted for between 18 months and two years, that's the system. \u00a0 MANAFORT: \u00a0Chris, when they get here, people, we don't even know who they are. \u00a0Not just -- again, not just from Syria. \u00a0They\u2019re coming from all places, many other places in the Middle East. \u00a0 Trump's position is very clear. \u00a0We have to have a system that lets us know who we're letting in. \u00a0He says, look, he\u2019s got a humanitarian approach. \u00a0Create sanctuary cities in the region where they're coming from, instead of the sanctuary cities in the United States, have the sanctuary states in their home locations. \u00a0 You know what? \u00a0Even people coming here would prefer that so they're closer to their families and their heritage. \u00a0There is -- (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: \u00a0Let me pick up quickly -- let me pick up quickly on that. \u00a0Because Trump in an interview with \"Meet the Press\" said not only Mideastern countries, we have to have what he calls extreme vetting for countries like France, which have terror cells in them. \u00a0Is that the way we're going to treat our allies, extreme vetting for anybody coming into this country, from France, from Germany, from Belgium? \u00a0 MANAFORT: \u00a0The difference is, France, Germany and Belgium, we have cooperative agreements with and we can work together with. \u00a0Syria, we don't. \u00a0 The Syrian government isn't going to work with us to vet their refugees coming to the United States. \u00a0In France and Belgium and the U.K., it is totally opposite thing. \u00a0So the practicality of doing the job is very obvious. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0He is now calling for extreme vetting for refugees or not refugees, people coming in from France. \u00a0 MANAFORT: \u00a0He is calling for cooperative efforts to make sure that wherever people are coming in, that we know who they are and what they stand for. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0I\u2019m sure you have seen some polls by now. Did Trump get any bounce out of the Republican convention? \u00a0And where is this race now? \u00a0 MANAFORT: \u00a0Well, we think we're ahead. \u00a0Especially in the battle ground states, which is we care more about than the national numbers -- I mean, you have to -- when you look at what is the result of the convention, frankly, you have to look at the last month, because Trump has been closing the gap between he and Clinton over the last three weeks. \u00a0 So, part of the convention bump has occurred before the convention. \u00a0We're confident that after the conventions, you're going to see continued growth in our direction, but more importantly, in the states that are going to elect Donald Trump, we've seen them move in and I\u2019m sure we're going to see more. \u00a0 Trump has expanded the map. \u00a0We're not looking for one way to win, as Romney was confronted with. \u00a0The one who\u2019s going to have difficulty finding paths to victory is going to be Clinton because we've expanded the map. \u00a0 Pennsylvania is in play, Wisconsin is in play, Michigan is in play, Iowa is in play, Connecticut is in play. \u00a0These are states that historically the Democrats lockdown early for the most part and force us to fight on defensive ground with maybe one or two ways to win. \u00a0 It\u2019s the opposite this year and we're comfortable coming out of our convention, we\u2019re -- again, the CNN polls that over 75 percent who were watching agreed with Donald Trump and thought he could bring about the change. \u00a0We think -- and that message was geared not at just Republicans, but at Democrats and independents too. \u00a0 We think that it\u2019s going to be a successful result of our convention. \u00a0The convention itself communicated what we wanted, and we think that Democrats are going to have problems keeping their coalition together, because the establishment is trying to abuse the progressives and their party, and they're the ones in chaos. \u00a0Not us. \u00a0 WALLACE: \u00a0Paul, thank you. \u00a0Thanks for joining us, after a very busy week. \u00a0Always good to talk with you. \u00a0 MANAFORT: \u00a0Thanks, Chris. \u00a0Look forward to seeing you again. \u00a0 WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss those leaked e-mails. \u00a0Was the DNC playing favorites in the primary battle between Clinton and Sanders? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: \u00a0Up next, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine make their debut on the Democratic ticket. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: \u00a0He is a progressive who likes to get things done. KAINE: \u00a0Vice-president was never a job I thought about growing up in Kansas. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0We\u2019ll ask our Sunday panel how Kaine got the nod and what role he\u2019ll play in the campaign next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: \u00a0I have to say that Senator Tim Kaine is everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not. \u00a0He is qualified to step into this job and lead on day one. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0Hillary Clinton on why she selected her running mate, Tim Kaine, during their first joint appearance yesterday in Miami. \u00a0It is time now for our Sunday group, Fox News senior political analyst, Brit Hume, Anne Gearan of the Washington Post, syndicated columnist, George Will, and Amy Walter from The Cook Political Report. Well, Bret, what do you think of the Clinton\/Kaine ticket and what kind of shape is the Clinton camp paying in heading into the convention? BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: \u00a0I think the choice was a wise one. \u00a0It accomplishes a couple of things for her. \u00a0It begins the pivot toward the center, the inevitable pivot toward center that candidates to always make if they want to win. It also puts before the public someone whom you can look at and say yes, that person could be president, which is important. \u00a0The importance of the vice-presidential pick fades going forward, but for these immediate purposes, I think he feels a bit fine. I think the Clinton campaign certainly thinks he is in pretty good shape, which explains the fact that they didn't really trout out the Kaine announcement in such a way as to try to step on Donald Trump's convention bounce, because it seems to be that he didn't or will not get much of a bounce. WALLACE: \u00a0Anne, you covered the Clinton campaign. \u00a0I would like to know what you've gotten from your sources and your reporting, why did she pick Kaine over Warren or Cory Booker or all the others? ANNE GEARAN, THE WASHINGTON POST: \u00a0She picked Kaine ultimately because she is the most comfortable with him, and he checks every box. \u00a0She didn't feel the need to reach for anything. \u00a0She didn't feel that she needed to reach for a very, very liberal person who would automatically kind of give her something that liberal things she lacks. She didn't think she needed to reach for someone with national security credentials that are very different than her own. \u00a0She didn't feel she needed to reach for anybody who had experiences other than her own, or came from a different part of the party. And I think that shows her comfort levels, different points, and that she really feels like he could be somebody that anyone could look at, and say yes, I could see that person being president. \u00a0And then she never has to think about it again. WALLACE: \u00a0As we discussed with Joel Benenson, there is another big story on the eve of this convention, and that's the leak of thousands of DNC, Democratic National Committee e-mails that seemed to confirm a lot of people\u2019s suspicions that the DNC was working to help Hillary Clinton, at the expense of Bernie Sanders. Amy, does this have the potential to disrupt this convention, and what seemed to be a, if not an alliance, a growing comfort between Clinton and Bernie Sanders and their supporters? AMY WALTER, \"THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": \u00a0I think, you know, when we came into the RNC, the question was how much disunity is there really, and what started out in Cleveland was some talk about the delegates erupting. \u00a0That didn't happen. \u00a0But there was still some dissension on the floor. The disunity continued to build throughout the event, concluding, of course, with Ted Cruz's decision not to endorse, and to get booed off the stage. \u00a0I don't think that is what we'll see here at all. And in fact, if the reports are true that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is not going to speak, that's probably a good idea for this convention, for Hillary Clinton. \u00a0You don't want any -- if you're the Clinton campaign, any attention focused on any sort of disunity. And I think the other thing, starting tomorrow, you're going to have two people only stage who liberals really do love. \u00a0Bernie Sanders who is going to speak tomorrow night and Michelle Obama. \u00a0That's going to be the focus moving forward, I think the DNC thing will fade away. WALLACE: \u00a0Before I bring in George, do you think Debbie Wassermann Schultz keeps her job between now and November or do you think that the Clinton campaign could decide because of the anger and the sense that all of their deepest suspicions were confirmed that they would sacrifice her? WALTER: \u00a0I don't know. \u00a0I mean, I think if I've learned anything from this year, it is how little the traditional parties have mattered. \u00a0Bernie Sanders, he didn't win the nomination, but he succeeded in part because not without the party's support, but he showed us he can go around the party support. You don't need those big donors and that access that the parties normally give you. \u00a0You don\u2019t need their voter list. \u00a0You can do it all throughout whether it is this device, you can connect with donors that way. \u00a0He proved, really, as did Donald Trump, that the parties have become less significant than ever. WALLACE: \u00a0George, we always, I think, assumed that the DNC was working on behalf of Hillary Clinton and to the detriment of Bernie Sanders. \u00a0Is the leak of these e-mails a big deal, or not? GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: \u00a0I don't think it will last for very long, but it does complicate her presentation at this convention. \u00a0The kind of people who work for the DNC are political operatives. \u00a0They have political views and they have political careers. They have an eye for the main chance, and they probably assumed all along it would be nice to be on the side of the person who will win. \u00a0A person in Hillary Clinton's incarnation who has contacts with all of the apparatus of the Democratic Party. \u00a0So they had a career reason for doing this. WALLACE: \u00a0Also, a practical effect, and the Bernie Sanders supporters will be upset, if you're looking to elect a Democratic president, wasn't Hillary Clinton a more likely choice than Bernie Sanders to win in November? WILL: \u00a0Absolutely. \u00a0And the fact that she won after a protracted struggle probably helped her in that it made her a better candidate. \u00a0It always does. \u00a0In the sense, I think on the part of the DNC, which I mean, when do we think about the DNC or the RNC for that matter? After candidate gets nominated, he often puts or she puts her own person or his own person in there. \u00a0We shouldn't be surprised it happened this time and we shouldn't think about it very much after. WALLACE: \u00a0All right, but for the purposes of today, it is a big story. \u00a0Anne, your thoughts? GAERAN: \u00a0It is confirmatory for the Sanders supporters that there was to their view, there was a finger on the scale all along, and that clearly, there was a selective leak of e-mails that tends to back that up. \u00a0That is a perception problem. It is potentially a problem when Sanders speaks tomorrow night. \u00a0It will -- it gives people who always wanted to have a reason to distrust this process some evidence to back that up. WALTER: \u00a0But the good news if you're Hillary Clinton is that the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign are in good standing. \u00a0This is the DNC that is a bigger problem as opposed to it being a fight between the two camps in the way that the Cruz and Trump were about the two individuals. WALLACE: \u00a0Chris, this is all kind of a piece with the argument we've had about the super delegates. \u00a0The super delegates represent the party regulars, and there are many more of them as a percentage of the total delegates here than is the case -- let me quickly say, these are people not elected as part of the primary process. \u00a0They're the mayors and governors and party officials, and they get to go in unbound and be for whoever they want to be. HUME: \u00a0Exactly right. \u00a0They played an important role in Hillary Clinton's nomination, and they did these super delegates, in that sense, precisely the system was created to do, which is to keep somebody out there where the buses don't run from getting the nomination. And it is certainly no surprise when you think about that, that the Democratic Party apparatus itself would be tipping in favor of the person they thought was more likely to win, and also, actually a Democrat, which Bernie Sanders except for using the party to advance his presidential aspirations is not. WALLACE: \u00a0We should point out, there was a meeting of the Rules Committee yesterday, they met for hours and hours and hours about the question of maybe there should be fewer super delegates, and more small D democratic in the sense that people -- the delegates on the floor have to be actually voted in by real people, by voters. \u00a0So they decided in their wisdom to appoint a commission. WALTER: \u00a0Don't they always. HUME: \u00a0But the net result is to reduce the impact of the super delegates, or even the size their presence here. \u00a0That will tell us the super delegates did exactly what the super delegates were intended to do in this election cycle, and therefore, they're being diminished. WALTER: \u00a0I hate these rules battles because it is always fighting the last war. \u00a0We have no idea what candidates are going to emerge and what issues are going to emerge four years for now. \u00a0This is fun and everything, but let's wait until we get to the next candidate -- WILL: \u00a0The Republicans think that perhaps they ought to have more super delegates. WALLACE: \u00a0All right, well, we're going to get to the Republicans in a moment. \u00a0We have to take a break here. When we come back, it was Donald Trump's time to shine, but from Melania's speech to Ted Cruz's non non-endorsement there were plenty of distractions. Plus what, would you like to ask the panel about how this affected Trump's ability to get his message out. \u00a0Just go to Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air. Much more from the Democratic National Convention when \"Fox News Sunday\" continues. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: \u00a0These are the forgotten men and women of our country. \u00a0I am your voice. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0Donald Trump, pushing the central theme of his campaign, as he accepted the GOP nomination Thursday night in Cleveland, and we're back now with the panel. So Brit, asked you about the Clinton campaign, where is the Trump campaign at the end of its convention and the beginning of this one, did they unify the Republican base, and were they at all successful in reaching out to undecided voters? HUME: \u00a0Well, I think that the party is about as unified as it will get with Donald Trump as its nominee. \u00a0And as for outreach to undecided voters and those who may now not be prepared to vote for Trump, I have my doubts, but I think the message, I am your voice, is the right message. I thought his speech was basically all that we\u2019ve been hearing him say for all these months now, except louder, and that may play well. \u00a0If I may use an imperfect nightclub analogy, he was not trying to be the friendly greeter, he was trying to be the bouncer. And it just may turn out that a bouncer is exactly what a lot of people want. \u00a0That's kind of how he came across. WALLACE: \u00a0We ask you for questions for the panel, and we got this on Facebook from Pattie Merz Kenaan. \u00a0With the pummeling that Hillary Clinton received this week by the speakers at the RNC convention, how does the RNC and Trump campaign plan to deal with the artillery that will surely be hurled by the Clinton campaign at the DNC convention next week? Amy, how do you answer Pattie because you know that Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama will try to rip Trump's skin off this week. WALTER: \u00a0That's right. \u00a0But I do think they're going to spend much more time trying to build up their candidate than trying to focus almost exclusively on Trump. \u00a0Part of the challenge at the RNC was that the one unifying factor because there still is some disunity among Republicans was Hillary Clinton. \u00a0That was an easy way to rally the troops in opposition to her. WALLACE: \u00a0I mean, Clinton has engage in -- WALTER: \u00a0One hundred percent. WALLACE: \u00a0-- character assassination of Trump. WALTER: \u00a0Absolutely, and that's not going stop. WALLACE: \u00a0OK. WALTER: \u00a0But I think you're going to see a convention, this is at least what I'm hearing, this one is going to be much more focused on while taking out Trump, focusing on a much brighter, sunnier kind of optimistic message, and one that talks more about Hillary Clinton, while also taking on Donald Trump. WALLACE: \u00a0And how do they deal directly with the issue of the big weakness on honesty and trustworthy. WALTER: \u00a0That's right. \u00a0I don't know that you'll ever be able to deal with that. \u00a0In fact, I think the reality for so many voters, come November, that won't go away. \u00a0She can't fix that. \u00a0I don\u2019t people won't find her more trustworthy. The question is whether they find her good enough to be president, or better choice in terms of doing the job of president. \u00a0They see her as more experienced. \u00a0Do they want that kind of president over Donald Trump? WALLACE: \u00a0George, you are to put it gently, not a Trump enthusiast. \u00a0Two questions, did you watch the Republican convention? WILL: \u00a0I did. WALLACE: \u00a0And secondly, what did you think of it? WILL: \u00a0I watched between innings. \u00a0The defining characteristic of the speaker, the nominee himself and the convention itself with the lock her up chance was anger. \u00a0I don\u2019t think the American people have elected an angry president, someone defined by anger, someone who is a (inaudible) anger since Andrew Jackson. And that was a 100 years before the invention of television, which brings presidents into our living room more than anyone other than family members. \u00a0I'm not sure the American people want anger in their living room. Mrs. Clinton said Kaine is everything that Trump\/Pence aren't, he could have said he is cheerful, a happy warrior. \u00a0A phrase applied to Democratic nominee, Al Smith and later to another Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey. So the question is, how do they deal with this problem with the perception of Mrs. Clinton? \u00a0I think they're going to fall back on Joe Biden\u2019s wonderful axiom, don't compare me to the all mighty, compare me to the alternative. And they are going to say the alternative is Donald Trump and do you want an angry man in your living room? WALLACE: \u00a0You say he is angry. \u00a0Trump is pushing back on the idea that his was a grim speech, or that he was angry, they're saying he was strong. \u00a0He was telling it like it is. WILL: \u00a0Well, Donald Trump is the one who was described contemporary America as a \"hell hole,\" that's a quote. \u00a0When you describe America as a place for people who are afraid to leave their houses, poverty and terrorism, I think most Americans think we have a wonderful country with serious problems. \u00a0I don't think they think it is a hell hole. WALLACE: \u00a0And what do -- what does the Clinton camp, what do they make of the Republican convention? \u00a0Do they think that he made any gains or got any bounce? GEARAN: \u00a0They see a lot in there they think they can capitalize on. \u00a0The darkness in their view of the Trump message, the ways in which Trump seems to be attacking American institutions, and America\u2019s presence in the world, Democrats think they can turn on its head and say, hey, wait a minute. \u00a0We're not failing. \u00a0We're not a failed state. \u00a0That's one message. There is concern within Hillary Clinton land that Trump is resonating on a couple of points. \u00a0The law and order and security issues primarily that he is touching something there that is national security, but also, really gets at a number of other areas of unease, social unease, economic unease, fears about safety. WALLACE: \u00a0And what about the idea, every election in a sense is a changed election. \u00a0Trump very much was arguing, he has change versus Hillary Clinton status quo. \u00a0He is with the people against the elite. GEARAN: \u00a0That's going to be a powerful argument for Trump, just because this would be the third Democratic administration in a row, and it has been Hillary Clinton's bet that it is far better to wrap herself in Barack Obama than to run away from him. So in a way, that opens -- Democrats think that that's good for them. \u00a0But it also obviously opens the door for Trump to make the accurate claim that she is basically running for a third term. \u00a0That she is trying to continue the current status quo, and if you don't like the status quo, then he is the change. WALLACE: \u00a0Brit. HUME: \u00a0The last third term election was in 1988, and one remembers Ronald Reagan at the Democratic Convention saying we are the change. \u00a0Some people, including David Broder of the \"Washington Post\" said he thought that's when he knew this election was going to the Republicans because it rang true. Of course, he was also saying in effect that things are going well. \u00a0They were. \u00a0Things in the public's mind at this stage are not going so well. \u00a0As the Democrats seek to portray this as a good idea to elect the Democrats as a third time, they have to be careful not to acknowledge that a lot of people do not think things are going well and they're really not looking for continuity, they're looking for change. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an easy task to defend what has been done, and yet say I'm going to make things different and better at the same time. \u00a0If you're too rosy, people will say these people are out of touch. \u00a0They don't understand. WALLACE: \u00a0Right track\/wrong track. WALTER: \u00a0That\u2019s exactly right. WALLACE: \u00a0What about 2\/1? WALTER: \u00a0Right, this is not 1988 or 2000. \u00a0There is a desire for change, but the question in fronts of voters that I think Hillary Clinton is going to give is change at what cost. \u00a0Is it worth making this change given what it could be? \u00a0And so the alternative, I may not be the best, but I\u2019m better than the alternative, that's the message that I think you're going to see. WALLACE: \u00a0Amy, we got less than a minute left. \u00a0The polls say this is tell a close race, in fact it has gotten closer since the FBI and James Comey's scolding of Hillary Clinton. \u00a0Is it still a close race? WALTER: \u00a0I think it is a close race and it will continue to be. \u00a0I'm with Joel. \u00a0I'm not going to look at numbers until we get out of this convention, and see what actually happens. WILL: \u00a0When the Republicans convene in 1988, Dukakis was 17 points ahead of George Herbert Walker Bush. \u00a0Polls at this point are fluid. WALLACE: \u00a0I remember that poll. \u00a0It was a \"Newsweek\" poll and it was a bit of an outlier. \u00a0Bush had the upper hand, and because of the circumstances in the country. \u00a0Not so good today. All right, thank you, panel. \u00a0See you next Sunday. Up next, a final word as we continue our coverage from the site of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.

Ted Cruz, faced down the White House with an ultimatum: Sign off on legislation that delays or defunds the Affordable Care Act or risk a government shutdown. Obama refused, unsurprisingly, to cut the legs out from under the law he'd spent the first year of his presidency -- and all the political capital that came with it -- selling to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including dozens of Democrats who would lose their seats in part because of their support for the controversial overhaul. In the end, the shutdown lasted 16 days --  the longest and most costly  in American history. And for almost all of them, future President Donald Trump was tweeting and talking, keeping up a drumbeat urging Republicans to stick together and do everything in their power to stop Obamacare, while skewering Obama as a weak leader and incompetent negotiator. Cheering on the Republicans In the weeks  leading up to the shutdown , the Republican-held House passed a bill that would have cut funding for the health care law while keeping the government open through December 15. The Democratic-held Senate rejected the House legislation, but not before Cruz launched a lengthy Senate floor filibuster of the vote. On September 27, the Senate passed the House bill -- minus the Obamacare defunding bit. Days later, the House approved another bill, this one delaying the law by a year. The two chambers would go back-and-forth a few more times, but the impasse remained. On Tuesday morning, October 1, the shutdown began.   Play-by-play of the shutdown On October 11 , Trump appeared on CNN for an interview with Piers Morgan.  First he offered Obama some advice.  \"I mean you just have a President that is not leading and not getting people into a room and not shouting, and cajoling, and laughing, and having a good time, and having a terrible time,\" he said. \"But, you know, all of these different emotions are things you have to do but you have to get people in a room and you have to just make deals for the good of the country.\" Trump, of course, has held at least a couple of bipartisan meetings -- for better or  much, much worse . Asked about the tea party and Cruz, who agitated for the House to hold up funding, Trump praised their tactics.  \"I'm a believer in the tea party, because what they want is what's really right for this country,\" he said. \"They want something to be done about this horrendous debt, something to be done about a lot of different things going on in the country. I mean our country is in a free fall and these are good American people. These are great American people.\" Trump also pushed for a more comprehensive agreement than was being discussed at the time.  \"Now, maybe as we're speaking, they're going to make a deal where they do some kind of an extension, but an extension is not what you need,\" he told Morgan. \"You need the overall deal. We have to make a big deal and it has to be the proper deal for the country.\" \"Now, maybe as we're speaking, they're going to make a deal where they do some kind of an extension, but an extension is not what you need,\" he told Morgan. \"You need the overall deal. We have to make a big deal and it has to be the proper deal for the country.\" Endgame By the time the shutdown ended, just after midnight on October 17, 2013, Trump had mostly moved on to other issues. He repeatedly mocked and assailed  the \"failed\" Obamacare website , while also deflecting a persistent rumor about his political future.  Fast forward to today and it's President Trump in the White House and Republicans in charge of both chambers of Congress.  Republican leadership now is pushing for a short-term \"continuing resolution\" to keep the government open. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are on the verge of rejecting it, demanding the fate of DACA recipients, whose protections will expire in March, be resolved now as part of a broader pact.

David Perdue of Georgia. Perdue added that the President is rightly upbeat about a \"very successful\" first year in office and will \"talk a good bit about the accomplishments.\" \"I hope the President lays out that record of achievement that we all work together so hard to produce,\" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, citing tax reform, regulation overhauls and Republican judicial confirmations. Cruz said priorities for 2018 should be \"finishing the job on Obamacare,\" and investing in border security.  \"I believe we should not pass an amnesty bill that creates a path to citizenship for millions of people here illegally,\" Cruz added, a possible reference to comments Trump made last week signaling an openness to such a plan for recipients of the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programming, which hardline conservatives consider \"amnesty.\" Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado said he expects Trump to speak about the \"success of the tax cuts,\" and \"how Americans are succeeding, how they're growing their wages, how they're growing their investment opportunities and really, how America's back.\" Sen.

But Graham also cited Trump's remarks last week on immigration, when he seemed open to compromise on the issue on Tuesday, then took a harder line at a different point in the week. \"I would just ask that Tuesday Trump to come to the State of the Union,\" Graham said, referring to that softer approach. \"If Tuesday Trump comes to the State of the Union and lays out a vision like he has in the past, we're in good shape.\" Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said he was most interested in getting \"an update on the international front,\" especially North Korea. He also said he wants to hear about the progress being made on NAFTA negotiations, and wants to know if Trump's thoughts on trade have changed now that he has become president.   Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas was also focused on trade, and said he hopes to hear Trump give a \"reaffirmation of a positive and robust trade policy.\" He said he thinks foreign countries \"are a little nervous about NAFTA, and we're going through a rough patch for the third year in a row.\" \"He could just say a couple lines to reassure farm country that he recognizes we have to export things we grow as well as things that we make,\" Roberts said, adding it will be interesting to see what the President says in the wake of his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma said he wants to hear Trump talk about the deficit and budget issues, and hopes Trump will lay out the details of his immigration proposal. The White House is set to unveil an immigration plan on Monday, after Trump  proposed giving 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants  a pathway to citizenship in exchange for $25 billion for a wall along the Mexican border and several other strict immigration reforms. \"I talked to the President about talking about prison reform,\" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said, which is \"something I've been working on, something I know that he and others are interested in.\" Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said he would like Trump to talk about funding for national security, and would also like him to \"crystallize a little more on the infrastructure package.\" \"I hope he talks about the opioid crisis,\" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. \"This is really devastating to so many communities across America.\" Of more than 20 senators in both parties interviewed recently about the State of the Union, Collins was the only one to raise the opioid crisis. \"I think it'll be one of the more interesting State of the Unions,\" Sen.

The indictment, which was long expected, is the first example of charges filed by special counsel Bob Mueller, who is investigating Russia's attempted meddling in the 2016 election and whether any collusion occurred between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. That, plus Manafort's lofty title and central role in Trump's campaign, makes it HUGE news. But, it's important to take a minute and detail what these charges against Manafort prove vis a vis Trump's campaign and what they don't. Let's start with what the Manafort charges prove in regards Trump.   Trump hired Manafort in the spring of 2016 as he was working to beat back what was, at the time, seen as a likely delegate fight with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at the Republican National Convention.   Manafort had two things that Trump needed: A knowledge of establishment Washington and a willingness to work for Trump. (Lots and lots of establishment Washington types -- even back then -- wouldn't go within a country mile of Trump's campaign.) Manafort also had long been someone with a demonstrated willingness to work for controversial\/authoritarian foreign leaders and businessmen with questionable pasts  -- most notably with his involvement in Ukraine, where he represented pro-Russian interests. No one -- and I mean no one -- in political Washington didn't know that about Manafort. Which leads to one of two conclusions about Trump (neither of which are a terribly good look): 1) He knew about Manafort's sketchy past and didn't care -- or thought it was not a big deal 2) He didn't know about Manafort's sketchy past. I'm not sure which one reflects more poorly on Trump. In the first scenario, he's willing to overlook what had to be doubts raised by his advisers about the issues of bringing Manafort on in such a senior role.  In the second, Trump simply didn't do the research necessary when hiring someone at such a senior level.  Either way, the Manafort indictment -- along with that of Rick Gates, a Manafort protege  who served as liaison between even the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee even after Manafort was fired in August 2016  -- raises real questions about Trump's judgment in regard to staffing at the highest levels of not just his campaign but the federal government. Trump repeatedly made his judgment an issue during the campaign. \"I'm going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,\" Trump told the Washington Post during the 2016 race. \"We want top of the line professionals.\" That quote seems a million miles away from Manafort's indictment. Now to what Manafort's indictment doesn't mean for Trump. Nothing in the unsealed indictment makes any mention of Russian collusion. While it's possible future indictments -- if they come -- will go into that territory, this one does not. The White House is already playing up that angle. \"Today has zero to do with the White House,\" one administration source told CNN's Jim Acosta.  Remember that Trump has been adamant -- as recently as Sunday on Twitter -- that there is no proof (and there will be no proof) of collusion between his campaign and the Russians. Manafort's indictment deals specifically with financial dealings  -- money laundering etc. -- and therefore allows Trump to insist that what Manafort did is all about Manafort and nothing about Trump or the 2016 campaign. It's important to take a breath here and remind yourself that it's likely -- though not certain -- that we are at the beginning of the legal proceedings stemming from Mueller's special counsel investigation, not the end. Meaning that drawing hard and fast conclusions about what the Manafort indictment tells us about the broader Mueller investigation is a mistake. What's clear is this: When your campaign chairman is indicted on charges of money laundering and filing false forms, it is never a good day for your presidency. But, what's also clear is that, as of right now, this Manafort indictment is far from Trump's worst case scenario.","articles_date":"30 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/30\/politics\/manafort-trumop-analysis\/index.html","articles_title":"What the Manafort indictment proves about Trump (and what it doesn't)","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":366,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Here are the stories our DC insiders are talking about in this week's \"Inside Politics\" forecast, where you get a glimpse of tomorrow's headlines today. 1) Bolton's beginning  John Bolton starts his new job as National Security Adviser Monday and he'll have plenty on his plate. President Trump's team has seen a major reshuffling over the past year, and Bolton's arrival could bring changes to the White House and its foreign policy. The Washington Post's Josh Dawsey explains: \"You have John Bolton coming in with a more hawkish worldview. You have the Iran deal decision -- the President has to decide if he's going to rip it up. You have North Korea talks that the President wants to do, and you have someone with a different idea in many fronts than the President on foreign policy, someone the President seems to have some charisma with,\" Dawsey reports.  \"I think there's some reticence at the NSC (National Security Council) and at the State Department possibly on John Bolton, but I think it will be interesting to watch.\" 2) Contentious confirmations? As Trump's cabinet and staff go through makeovers, Congress gears up to weigh in on Trump's replacement picks. Trump's new choices for State, Veterans' Affairs and CIA director may face contentious confirmation hearings.  Politico's Eliana Johnson explains: \"Republicans in the Senate are annoyed and fatigued at having to push these (candidates) through, and Democrats have a real opportunity to energize their base by opposing these,\" she says. \"I'm looking at which one they're going to try to oppose, one or more, and I think that one of these has a real chance at failing.\" 3) The Pompeo pick Speaking of that, Mike Pompeo's confirmation hearing is Thursday. There's already trouble brewing for him with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee because Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) has announced his opposition.  As CNN's Manu Raju reports, there's a one-vote advantage for the GOP on that committee, but Dems might actually help the president's pick here.  \"There are two Democrats who voted for him for CIA director when he was confirmed by a 66-32 vote. That's Senator Tim Kaine, Senator Jeanne Shaheen. They both sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\" Manu reports.  \"Of course, the State Department secretary versus being CIA director, much different positions ... a lot of questions about whether or not they will support him going forward...we'll see if any Democrats decide to jump ship because otherwise he could be in trouble on the floor, too.\" 4) Teachers get political  Teachers in a handful of states are voicing their displeasure with low pay or lack of resources by striking or walking out. Educators in West Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma are trying to pressure state lawmakers to meet their demands.  Time's Molly Ball tells us the political impact of this trend.  \"There are 36 gubernatorial elections this November, the majority of them Republican-held. These teachers, surprising even the teachers unions by rising up, demanding better pay, and Democrats are looking at this thinking this could be part of the wave of activism that they expect to power any success,\" Ball says.   \"This is about women. The teachers are mostly women. It affects moms. A lot of teachers are even running for office.

Senator John McCain, absent from Capitol Hill since mid-December, is staying back home as he receives treatment for brain cancer.  As CNN's John King reports, McCain's staff hasn't discussed a timetable for his return after they initially promised he would be back at work in January. \"The senator's friends will be happy to know McCain was highly annoyed by a Washington Post story last week noting that there are quiet conversations in Arizona and in Washington about replacing Senator McCain if he cannot return and decides to retire,\" King says.  \"McCain told several friends in recent days, 'I'm not going anywhere,'\" King adds. \"He is said to be in good spirits, working on building his strength and determined to return to work.\"","articles_date":"8 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/08\/politics\/ip-notebooks-john-bolton-first-day\/index.html","articles_title":"What to expect in John Bolton's first week as National Security Adviser","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":367,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) This year's midterm elections officially kick off Tuesday with the Texas primaries, where voters will sift through jam-packed fields of Democratic candidates vying to take on vulnerable Republican members of Congress. Here's what you need to know: Polls open at 8 a.m. EST and close at 8 p.m. EST for most of the state. In the El Paso area, the polls open at 9 a.m. EST and close at 9 p.m. EST. Democrats are running in all of Texas' 36 congressional districts for the first time in 25 years. Democrats have an edge in early voting, a notable, though limited, gauge of voter enthusiasm in what's been a reliably red state. Candidates must top 50% in their primary, or the top two finishers will head to a runoff election in six weeks. Incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke are likely to win their respective primaries. CNN recently  moved  the Texas Senate race from Solid Republican to Likely Republican. Here's a closer look at the six races to watch tonight: Family legacy on the line:  Incumbent Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush -- the son of Jeb Bush and the last Bush in political office -- faces a primary challenge from former land commissioner Jerry Patterson. This is a race over the Alamo: Patterson has campaigned against what he calls Bush's failed stewardship of the site of the historic battle. Progressives vs. Establishment:  It was already a bare-knuckled brawl among the seven Democrats vying to take on Republican Rep. John Culberson in Texas' 7th House District. Then the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee got involved, dropping a bomb on one of the candidates, Laura Moser,a candidate backed by Bernie Sanders' allies,  and turning the race into something of a proxy for the larger war within the party. Emily's List-backed lawyer Lizzie Pannill Fletcher and attorney Alex Triantaphyllis are other candidates to watch in a race that could be headed for a runoff. Take a closer look at that race  here . Border district brawl : Party figures have split over this contest to take on GOP Rep. Will Hurd in the 23rd House District between Iraq War veteran Gina Ortiz Jones, former federal prosecutor Jay Hulings and former Agriculture Department official Judy Canales. Democrats fight for Dallas:  The third competitive Republican-held seat in Texas' 32nd District is represented by Republican Pete Sessions. The Democrats vying to replace him are former NFL player and attorney Colin Allred, former Agriculture Department official Lillian Salerno and former State Department official Ed Meier. Who will take on Abbott:  Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, running to oppose Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, is the statewide headliner for Democrats this cycle. But Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is up for re-election as well, and former Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez and businessman Andrew White are vying to take him on. An interesting split:  The campaign to replace retiring Rep. Gene Green in the reliably blue 29th District has seen an interesting split between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is backing Tahir Javed, and Emily's List and the other New York senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, who are backing state Sen. Sylvia Garcia. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect poll times in the El Paso area. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly identify state Sen. Sylvia Garcia.","articles_date":"6 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/06\/politics\/texas-primaries-what-to-watch\/index.html","articles_title":"What to look for in tonight's Texas primary","candidate_fk":17,"first_name":"Beto","id":368,"issue":8,"last_name":"O'Rourke","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Both major parties will hold primaries in Virginia's gubernatorial race, the first time they've held the contests on the same day in the commonwealth's history.  The vote will be the first statewide political contest since the election of President Donald Trump, and the controversial early days of his administration loom large over the contests on both sides of the aisle. Here are five things to look for: Establishment vs. insurgency  Both contests feature established candidates with lengthy political careers facing off against insurgent, populist candidates hoping to upset the power bases of their respective parties.  The Democratic contest has proven to be more competitive, with former Rep. Tom Perriello feeding off the enthusiasm of liberals ready to send Trump a message. Perriello has earned the support of prominent national democratic leaders, but Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam retains the support of the state party apparatus.  The race has been framed as a reboot of the Bernie Sanders-Hillary Clinton contest, but the comparison is not a perfect fit. Northam has pushed his campaign further to the left and has described Trump as a narcissistic maniac -- while Perriello has attempted to reach out to Trump voters by selling a message of economic populism framed through a progressive perspective.  On the Republican side, former George W. Bush aide Ed Gillespie is building off the goodwill he established with Republicans after his narrow loss to Sen. Mark Warner in 2014. Gillespie has successfully tiptoed around the presence of Trump, embracing his policies that are popular with Republicans without directly tying his campaign to the President.  It hasn't been easy. Flame-throwing challenger Corey Stewart, the chair of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, has touted his former role as the Trump campaign chairman and has challenged Gillespie to pledge his allegiance to Trump. Stewart has waged a campaign to protect Confederate monuments around the state and was the only candidate to not outright reject an alt-right rally in Charlottesville organized by white nationalist Richard Spencer.  Gillespie has basically ignored Stewart, and the strategy has worked. Most polls show Gillespie with a double-digit lead. A third candidate, State Sen. Frank Wagner, has struggled to gain traction, despite  winning the endorsement  of The Washington Post's editorial board.  Turnout Primaries for state level elections in Virginia are known for their notoriously low turnout, despite the fact that the vote is open to all registered voters. Turnout in 2017 could be an important key in this race because the insurgent candidates on both sides are likely banking on the fact that many voters that don't normally participate will this time around.  That will be especially important for Perriello, who is counting on a wave of Democratic enthusiasm and is running without the benefit of the party infrastructure. Polls have shown that Perriello has a slight lead in the race, but that lead may be contingent on unreliable pools of voters who usually sit primaries out.  The energetic candidate is hoping his effective media strategy and relentless campaign schedule (he spent the weekend before the primary on a 24-hour get-out-the-vote swing) will turn the tide. A little more than 319,000 Democrats turned out in a three-way primary in 2009.  Absentee ballot applications are up significantly as compared to previous gubernatorial elections, which could indicate a higher than usual overall turnout.  A variety of Virginia politicos to whom CNN spoke peg the magic number at 375,000 voters -- above that number could be good for Perriello, but below that should indicate a Northam win.   Which endorsements matter  In the closing days of the Democratic primary race, Northam will appear multiple times with Virginia's powerful trio of popular statewide elected Democrats. Warner, Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Sen. Tim Kaine have stuck by the lieutenant governor, whom all three have known and served with for a long time.   That show of support should matter to the politically tuned-in primary electorate. But Perriello has the support of popular national figures. He's currently running a TV ad that features Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former President Barack Obama singing his praises. Sanders and Warren have formally endorsed Perriello in this race, though Obama has not. It is the kind of ad that could compel a Democrat who normally only participates in presidential contests to make the effort to vote in Tuesday's primary.   Gillespie, meanwhile, has locked in support from Republican Party leaders from top to bottom in Virginia, but what he doesn't have -- and what he hasn't sought -- is the support of the sitting Republican president.  In 2009 and 2013, Obama not only endorsed but held rallies in support of the Democratic candidates in Virginia. That was, of course, after the primary, but there is no sign Gillespie will be in search in the same kind of lift from Washington in 2017. Trump is not only a polarizing figure, but Virginia was one of the few swing states he lost.  Stewart, despite the fact that his run is in many ways a clone of the Trump campaign, also does not enjoy the support of the President. But that hasn't stopped him from embracing the President, his policies and his persona while reminding primary voters of Gillespie's careful maneuvering around Trump.    Corporate influence  Perriello is outright rejecting the support of one of the most powerful political entities in Virginia, the state's public utility, Dominion Energy. Dominion has long been a major donor to both Republicans and Democrats, and in 2017, the company has donated to both Northam and Gillespie's campaigns. But not only did Perriello not take their money, he has vowed to stop the company's efforts to build pipelines in the state. Northam has taken a more cautious approach on the pipeline, calling for a rigorous review before they are built without outright rejecting the proposal. Perriello is hoping Virginia progressives view his move as a signal that he will rid corporate influence from the governor's mansion -- a task that will be much easier said than done. National reaction to the outcome No matter what happens on Tuesday, national political prognosticators are going to attempt to draw a grand conclusion on what the result tells us about American voters in the era of Trump. Chances are those conclusions will be a stretch. We may get a glimpse of Democratic enthusiasm, but it will still be an incredibly small sample size. The Virginia primary electorate is fickle, unpredictable and varies greatly depending on the year. Any attempt to use the results as a basis for predictions about the direction of the country are at best premature. It may not even offer much of a signal about what to expect from Virginia voters in November.","articles_date":"13 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/13\/politics\/what-to-watch-in-virginia-primary\/index.html","articles_title":"What to watch for in Virginia's primary election","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":369,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) Both major parties will hold primaries in Virginia's gubernatorial race, the first time they've held the contests on the same day in the commonwealth's history.

Washington (CNN) The 2018 midterm season is upon us and the storyline in the House and Senate will be the balance of power and whether Republians can hold their majorities in both chambers. The momentum is tipping toward Democrats big time, particularly in House races, according  to the latest CNN reporting.  But Democrats are defending more than two dozen Senate seats, including 10 in states President Donald Trump won in 2016. Republicans have just eight Senate seats up for re-election.  Here's a look at where things stand and what's coming up in each of the 2018 midterm primaries. A number of special elections are included. March Tuesday, March 6 \u2022 Texas Races to watch: TX-07 (Hurd), TX-23 (Culberson), TX-32 (Sessions) November outlook:  Three-term GOP Rep. Will Hurd is running for re-election in this Clinton-won 2016 district in San Antonio. The anticlimactic outcome of the immigration debate could have an impact on his prospects in the fall, as CNN rates this race as a toss-up. GOP Reps. John Culberson and Pete Sessions could find themselves in tough races. Culberson goes into 2018 with a slight cash disadvantage and faces demographic changes trending Democratic in this Houston-based district, and liberal pockets of northern Dallas could threaten Sessions. Both races are ranked lean Republican. Sen. Ted Cruz will almost certainly face Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke in his own bid for re-election. CNN currently rates the race likely Republican, but O'Rourke out-raised Cruz in the final two quarters of 2017, and this contest is worth watching as the midterm cycle progresses. RELATED: Takeaways from the Texas primary results RELATED: No blue wave in Texas yet Election Day: Tuesday, March 13 \u2022  Pennsylvania  PA-18 special election Democratic challenger Conor Lamb scored a remarkable upset with his victory over Republican Rick Saccone in a district Trump won by 20 percentage points in 2016. Related: Democrat's victory is latest sign of a 2018 wave Primary date: Tuesday, March 20 \u2022 Illinois  Races to watch: IL-06 (Roskam), IL-12 (Bost), IL-13 (Davis), IL-14 (Hultgren) November outlook:  Four Republican-held House seats are seen as competitive in the land of Lincoln. Rep. Peter Roskam, who came into Congress during the Democratic wave of 2006, may face a tight race in his Clinton-won district of Chicago's west suburbs. A loss for Rep. Mike Bost in southwest Illinois could portend major Democratic wins in the fall. For Democrats, conservative Dan Lipinski is ahead after a tough primary. Related: Illinois primary results April Election Day: Tuesday, April 24 \u2022  AZ-08 special election GOP Rep. Trent Franks resigned  after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment from two female former staffers. Republican state Sen. Debbie Lesko emerged from a 12-person primary in February and will face off against Democrat Hiral Tipirneni, an emergency room doctor. This is seen as a safe Republican seat, but Democrats are making a late push to attempt to make it competitive. May Primary date: Tuesday, May 8 \u2022  OH-12 special primary GOP Rep. Pat Tiberi resigned in January to take over as head of the Ohio Business Roundtable. Democrats look likely to nominate former Franklin County Sheriff Zach Scott or Franklin County Recorder Danny O'Connor. The Republicans have a wide-open field, with state Sen. Kevin Bacon among the leading contenders. CNN rates the race as likely Republican. \u2022  Indiana Races to watch: Indiana US Senate race November outlook:  Sen.  Joe Donnelly is one of the most vulnerable Democrats  up for re-election this year. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the Hoosier state by 19 points in 2016. Two GOP representatives -- Todd Rokita and Luke Messer -- will battle it out on May 8 to determine who takes on Donnelly in November. \u2022  North Carolina Races to watch: NC-02 (Holding), NC-09 (Pittenger), NC-13 (Budd) November outlook:  Three Republican-held seats will be important to watch in North Carolina. Reps. George Holding, Robert Pittenger and Ted Budd all won re-election in 2016 with at least 55% of the vote, but they could be at risk if Democrats win big in the fall.  RELATED: Judges order North Carolina congressional districts redrawn quickly \u2022  Ohio Races to watch: OH-01 (Chabot), OH-12 (open, Tiberi -- see above) November outlook:  The race to succeed Gov. John Kasich will be an important race to watch, as former Obama Consumer Financial Protection Bureau head Richard Cordray seeks to bring his party back into the governor's mansion, possibly with the  help of populist Sen. Sherrod Brown who is up for re-election  in the Buckeye State. Popular Republican Rep. Steve Chabot's Cincinnati seat will be critical for the GOP to keep the House. This race is rated as likely Republican.  \u2022  West Virginia Races to watch: West Virginia US Senate November outlook:  Democrat Joe Manchin will face a tough re-election fight for this Senate seat. Trump beat Clinton by over 40 points here. Manchin -- a former two-term governor -- hopes his  moderate views and history with the state  will put him over the top, as his state trends further right. The GOP primary is competitive, with Rep. Evan Jenkins battling Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and ex-convict Don Blankenship, former CEO of Massey Energy Co. RELATED: Mike Pence targets vulnerable Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Primary date: Tuesday, May 15 \u2022  Idaho \u2022  Nebraska Races to watch: NE-02 (Bacon) November outlook:  Rep. Don Bacon was the only Republican to beat a Democratic incumbent in 2016. Democrats have this Omaha-based seat in their sights in their quest to take back the majority in the House. This seat is rated as a toss-up by CNN.  GOP Sen. Deb Fischer  is up for re-election.  \u2022  Oregon \u2022  Pennsylvania Races to watch: PA-01 (Fitzpatrick), PA-05 (open, Meehan), PA-06 (Costello), PA-07 (open, Dent), PA-08 (Cartwright), PA-10 (Perry), PA-17 (Rothfus) November outlook:  Democratic   Sen. Bob Casey could face a tough re-election if Republicans raise enough money and run a strong campaign in the commonwealth. CNN currently rates seven of the 18 House seats as key races to watch.  New districts  that were handed down by the state Supreme Court after ruling the current lines were gerrymandered in favor of the GOP  could put more seats in play  come the fall.  Primary date: Tuesday, May 22 \u2022  Arkansas Races to watch: AR-02 (Hill) November outlook:  Republicans are strongly favored to hold all four congressional seats in Arkansas, but Little Rock-based Rep. French Hill faces a solid Democratic challenger in state Rep. Clarke Tucker. CNN rates it as likely Republican. Gov. Asa Hutchinson is up for re-election as well and is widely seen as a safe bet for Republicans too. \u2022  Georgia Races to watch: GA-06 (Handel), GA-07 (Woodall) November outlook:  If Democrats want to pick up seats in Georgia, they may look at the 6th and 7th districts.  GOP Rep. Karen Handel won a tough battle  to succeed former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in 2017, despite a major cash influx for Democrat Jon Ossoff, which will make it difficult for them to win. But if 2018 turns into a wave for Democrats, Handel and Rep. Rob Woodall could become vulnerable. CNN currently rates both races as likely Republican. The open governor seat may influence the race, should it become competitive, depending on the outcome of the primaries, in which both parties may move farther from the center than their respective party leaders in the Peach State. \u2022  Kentucky Races to watch: KY-06 (Barr) November outlook:  Three-term Republican Rep. Andy Barr's race is currently rated as lean Republican by CNN. He has won at least 60% of the vote in each election, but Democrats will likely field strong competition, which could put this seat in play. June  Primary date: Tuesday, June 5 \u2022  Alabama Despite a surprise victory from Democrat Doug Jones in the special election for the Senate last year, no Alabama seat is seen as competitive this year for either party, including Republican Gov. Kay Ivey as she seeks her first full term. RELATED: 5 takeaways from Doug Jones' massive victory in Alabama \u2022  California Races to watch: CA-07 (Bera), CA-10 ( Denham ), CA-21 (Valadao), CA-25 (Knight), CA-39 (open, Royce), CA-45 (Walters), CA-48 (Rohrabacher), CA-49 (open, Issa), CA-50 (Hunter)  November outlook:  Eight of the nine House seats rated as competitive by CNN are currently held by Republicans, some of which are in districts Clinton won in 2016. If Democrats are going to take back the House, they will need (and may get) a few of these to do it. While the Senate seat is expected to stay in Democratic hands, the primary and general election against  Sen. Dianne Feinstein  could turn competitive, as she will likely face a more progressive Democrat in the fall due to the state's jungle primary laws. California has a competitive governor's race to replace outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown, with top contenders in Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, both Democrats.  \u2022  Iowa Races to watch: IA-01 (Blum), IA-03 (Young) November outlook:  Two-term GOP Rep. Rod Blum's race is rated as a toss-up. Blum won 51% and 54% in his northeastern Iowa district during his first two campaigns but could face his toughest race in a year that could favor Democrats. Fellow sophomore Rep. David Young is also being heavily targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Both of these districts voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 before flipping to Trump in 2016. \u2022  Mississippi November outlook:  Sen. Thad Cochran's upcoming retirement --  announced in early March  -- sets up a special US Senate election in Mississippi, meaning both of the state's Senate seats will be on the ballot come November. GOP Sen. Roger Wicker is up for re-election and is facing a primary challenge from state Sen. Chris McDaniel -- who nearly knocked off Cochran in a high-profile primary race in 2014. Mississippi's House races are not seen as competitive this year. \u2022  Montana Races to watch: MT Sen;  MT-AL November outlook:   Democratic Sen. Jon Tester will face voters for the third time , but this year he's coming on the heels of Trump's 21-point win in Big Sky Country. Republicans see this seat as a perfect opportunity for a flip, but party members have yet to coalesce around one candidate. Tester's significant money advantage gives him a slight edge, as CNN rates this race lean Democrat.  Controversial GOP Rep. Greg Gianforte's race  is rated as likely Republican at the beginning of 2018. \u2022  New Jersey Races to watch: NJ-02 (open, LoBiondo), NJ-03 (MacArthur), NJ-05 (Gottheimer), NJ-07 (Lance), NJ-11 (open, Frelinghuysen)  November outlook:  Five of New Jersey's 12 congressional seats are on CNN's competitive ratings this year. The two open seats left by retiring GOP Reps. Rodney Frelinghuysen and Frank LoBiondo are seen as big targets for Democrats to flip.  Trump's unpopularity in the Garden State  could curtail the GOP's attempts to rebuild after losing the governor's mansion last year.  Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez is up for a third term this year , in a race that CNN ranks as solid Democrat. \u2022  New Mexico Races to watch: NM-02 (open, Pearce) November outlook:  Four-term GOP Rep. Steve Pearce is running for governor, which leaves a slight opening for Democrats in this southern New Mexico district. The area trends conservative, as CNN rates this House race as likely Republican. Pearce will have a tough race to succeed Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, whose approval ratings have fallen as she ends her second term. Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich is up for re-election.  \u2022  South Dakota Primary date: Tuesday, June 12 \u2022  Maine Races to watch: ME-02 (Poliquin) November outlook:  Democrats would like to take back the last Republican-held seat in Maine's 2nd District, but that could prove tougher than expected. The district's support of Trump (giving him an electoral vote in 2016) and Rep. Bruce Poliquin's strong cash advantage will be tough to beat in this northern Maine seat. CNN currently rates the race as likely Republican, though the governor's race could provide Democrats a place to flip a state executive seat from red to blue.  Independent Sen. Angus King  is up for re-election.  \u2022  North Dakota Races to watch: North Dakota US Senate November outlook:   Democrat Heidi Heitkamp faces a tough re-election  for her Senate seat, and she's raising the money for a fight. GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer said in January that he would not run for the seat before reversing course and announcing his candidacy in mid-February. Trump won the state by 36 points, and Republicans are determined to beat Heitkamp. CNN initially rated this race as lean Democrat, but with Cramer's candidacy, it is now a toss-up. \u2022  Nevada Races to watch: NV Sen; NV-03 (open, Rosen), NV-04 (open, Kihuen) November outlook:  Looking to capitalize on Clinton's 2016 win and the state's trend toward Democrats, Nevada will be home to some of the country's toughest competitions this year for the House, the Senate and the Governor's Mansion. Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen is  challenging Republican Sen. Dean Heller,  in a race rated as toss-up by CNN. Rosen leaves her current House seat open, which CNN also rates as a toss-up. After being accused of sexual harassment, Democratic Rep. Ruben Kihuen announced he won't seek reelection. His central Nevada district, including the Las Vegas suburbs, gives Democrats a slight advantage, as CNN rates this race lean Democrat.  \u2022  South Carolina \u2022  Virginia  Races to watch: VA-02 (Taylor), VA-05 (Garrett), VA-7 (Brat), VA-10 (Comstock)  GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock's DC exurb district is a big target for a Democratic flip in November. This will most likely be the most competitive race in the state this year, followed by that of Rep. Scott Taylor, a Republican who represents the hometown of the state's Democratic governor. Taylor's strong military background and willingness to work across the aisle give him an advantage, as CNN ranks this race as lean Republican.  Sen. Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential candidate , has yet to see a strong candidate against him in the fall. CNN rates his race as likely Democrat.  Primary date: Tuesday, June 19 \u2022  District of Columbia Primary date: Tuesday, June 26 \u2022  Colorado Races to watch: CO-06 (Coffman) November outlook:  GOP Rep. Mike Coffman will face an intense battle for a sixth term, as this district, which includes Denver suburbs, voted for Clinton in 2016. This diverse district with a growing Hispanic population has trended Democratic, which in part is why CNN ranks the race as a toss-up. The governor's race could affect down-ticket races, though the state as a whole has trended Democratic as well over the past few elections.  \u2022  Maryland November outlook:  No congressional race is viewed as competitive in Maryland, but a pending Supreme Court case on gerrymandering districts in favor of Democrats could change the map here. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan is popular in the state, which could help him separate himself from the national party -- not viewed as favorably here -- to win a second term.  Chelsea Manning,  the former Army intelligence analyst convicted of disclosing classified information to WikiLeaks, is running for Senate as a Democrat. \u2022  New York Races to watch: NY-01 (Zeldin), NY-11 (Donovan), NY-19 (Faso), NY-22 (Tenney), NY-24 (Katko) November outlook:  Five GOP congressional races are ranked somewhat competitive by CNN. Reps. John Faso and Claudia Tenney have lagged behind in fundraising going into 2018, as CNN rates their seats as toss-ups. Democrats are hoping their national popularity will help them unseat Faso in his Hudson Valley district. Though Tenney represents the more conservative Binghamton area, Obama did well there, showing the power of a motivated Democratic Party they hope to capitalize on again. With a governor and Senate race ( Kirsten Gillibrand's seat is ranked solid Democrat heading into her re-election bid ), the Big Apple could be the home of big wins for Democrats. \u2022  Oklahoma \u2022  Utah Races to watch: UT-04 (Love) November outlook:  Utah may not house the most competitive races of 2018, but the Beehive State will be buzzing. Former 2012 Presidential nominee Mitt Romney recently announced his run for the open Senate seat there, which is ranked as solid Republican by CNN.  GOP Rep. Mia Love  will face a tough race this fall and is currently lagging behind in fundraising. Her Salt Lake City district is a strong Republican area, as CNN ranks this race as lean Republican. August Primary date: Thursday, August 2 \u2022  Tennessee Races to watch: TN Sen November outlook:  Tennessee's nine districts are not ranked as competitive, though the Senate seat left open by Republican Bob Corker's retirement, reconsideration and final decision to retire  has sparked an interest on both sides of the aisle.  It will be a tough race for Democrats, though  popular former Gov. Phil Bredesen  could give the GOP a run for its money, even though Trump won the state by 26 points. CNN ranks this race as likely Republican. Primary date and Election Day: Tuesday, August 7 \u2022  OH-12 special election Special election for former GOP Rep. Pat Tiberi's seat. Tiberi resigned to join the Ohio Business Roundtable. CNN rates this Columbus-suburb district as likely Republican. \u2022  Kansas Races to watch: KS-02 (open, Jenkins), KS-03 (Yoder) November outlook:  The Kansas side of Kansas City is a potential risk for Republicans. As GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder seeks a fifth term, he's weighed down by a district that narrowly voted for Clinton in 2016. Yoder's cash advantage gives him a good start, as CNN rates this race as lean Republican. \u2022  Michigan Races to watch: MI-06 (Upton), MI-07 (Walberg), MI-08 (Bishop), MI-11 (open, Trott) November outlook:  Four Michigan Republican-held seats are viewed as competitive by CNN, leading with retiring Rep. David Trott's Detroit-suburb district ranked as toss-up. Rep. Michael Bishop will seek a third term in his Lansing-based district, where Trump expanded the margin of the two past presidential winners, though he's been outraised by his Democratic opponent. CNN rates this race as lean Republican. A good night for Democrats in November could put GOP Reps. Fred Upton and Tim Walberg at risk, but for now, their races are ranked as likely Republican.  \u2022  Missouri Races to watch: Missouri US Senate  November outlook:   Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill will most likely face the toughest race  she's experienced as she seeks a third term. Coming off the heels of Trump's 19-point win, Republicans are intent on flipping this seat in the Show Me state to their side. Democratic strength nationwide helped McCaskill in 2006 and 2012, which makes her party's momentum heading into November a critical factor in this race. \u2022  Washington state Races to watch: WA-05 (McMorris Rodgers), WA-08 (open, Reichert) November outlook:  GOP Rep. Dave Reichert's retirement gives Democrats a big opening in this district of Seattle suburbs where Clinton won in 2016. CNN rates this race as a toss-up. House Republican Caucus leader Cathy McMorris Rodgers has a significant money lead and history in the district, giving her a significant advantage over her Democratic rivals, but momentum on the left cannot be ignored in this east Washington district. CNN ranks this race as likely Republican. Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell is up for re-election.  Primary date: Saturday, August 11 \u2022  Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono is up for re-election.  Primary date: Tuesday, August 14 \u2022  Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy  is up for re-election. \u2022  Minnesota Races to watch: MN-01 (open, Walz), MN-02 (Lewis), MN-03 (Paulsen), MN-07 (Peterson), MN-08 (open, Nolan) November outlook:  Three congressional districts in Minnesota are ranked as toss-ups by CNN. Two Democratic-held seats by retiring Reps. Tim Walz and Rick Nolan are targets for Republicans, hoping to use Trump's wins as a springboard to victory. Democrats are targeting freshman Rep. Jason Lewis, whose district covers the southern suburbs of Minneapolis. Lewis's likely Democratic opponent outraised him more than 2-to-1 in the final fundraising quarter of 2017, but the incumbent still holds an overall cash on hand advantage.  Democratic Sen. Tina Smith is running to serve the rest  of former Sen. Al Franken's term.  Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar  is up for re-election.  \u2022  Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders  is up for re-election.  \u2022  Wisconsin Races to watch: WI Sen; WI-03 (Kind), WI-06 (Grothman) November outlook:  Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin will face a tough re-election in the Badger State, coming off Trump's historic 2016 win there. A Republican presidential candidate hadn't won the state in the 28 years prior. CNN currently rates this race as lean Democrat.  Primary date: Tuesday, August 21 \u2022  Alaska \u2022  Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso  is up for re-election.  Primary date: Tuesday, August 28 \u2022  Arizona Races to watch: AZ Sen; AZ-01 (O'Halleran), AZ-02 (open, McSally), AZ-09 (open, Sinema) November outlook:  If Democrats have any chance of taking back the Senate, they will have to win in Arizona.  Republican Jeff Flake's retirement opened the seat up , and both sides are already campaigning hard for it. Trump's immigration policies and positions will most likely embolden supporters and detractors to come to the polls in the Grand Canyon State, which he won by only 4 points in 2016. The race is ranked as a toss-up by CNN.  Republicans former Sheriff Joe Arpaio  and  former state Sen. Kelli Ward  are both running to fill Flake's seat.  \u2022  Florida Races to watch: FL Sen; FL-07 (Murphy), FL-13 (Crist), FL-18 (Mast), FL-26 (Curbelo), FL-27 (open, Ros-Lehtinen) November outlook:  Democrats could show some strength in Florida, where one Republican-held seat is already ranked as lean Democrat by CNN. GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo is in danger of losing his seat composing the southern tip of the state.  GOP Rep. Tom Rooney is retiring  rather than seeking a sixth term this fall. Rooney represents an overwhelmingly Republican district south of Orlando and Tampa that Trump won by 27 percentage points in 2016 -- so it's likely to remain in GOP hands in November. Democrat Bill Nelson could face a tough re-election for the Senate with a strong candidate like current Gov. Rick Scott, who has not declared. This race is currently ranked lean Democrat.

With the retirement of Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porte r, her district has flipped between both parties multiple times over the past decade. This seat is currently ranked as a toss-up by CNN. Democrat Ann Kuster's race will most likely not be as as competitive, but both parties have the history and know-how to win in the Granite State. CNN currently ranks this race as likely Democrat.

Boris Nemtsov Plaza in Washington, DC. Bobby Sands Street in Tehran, Iran. What do these far removed roads have in common? They are all home to important foreign embassies, and their names were all designed to shame their residents. Modern history is rich with examples of symbolically renamed embassy sites. Here are a few telling examples from around the globe: Olive Branch Street, Ankara, Turkey On Monday, the road that leads to the US Embassy in Ankara was officially changed to Olive Branch Street, according to  Turkish state broadcaster TRT . While the moniker might, at first glance, seem like an effort to repair the strained relationship between the United States and Turkey, it actually pays tribute to the latter country's ongoing military effort in Syria -- Operation Olive Branch -- which the United States opposes. At a news briefing in Washington last week, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert shrugged off the name change, even as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was preparing for a visit to the Turkish capital. \"If a city decides it wants to rename a street something, especially in Turkey or Russia, where we support freedom of speech, they can call it whatever they want,\" Nauert said. \"As long as it's in accordance with their own law, we're fine with that.\" Turkish officials made a similar move last month to needle the United Arab Emirates, renaming the street where that country's embassy sits after an Ottoman military commander disparaged by the UAE's foreign minister,  according to the BBC . Boris Nemtsov Plaza, Washington, DC Last month, Washington's city council  unanimously passed a measure  to symbolically rename the stretch of Wisconsin Avenue in front of the Russian Embassy after Boris Nemtsov, a pro-democracy activist and critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin who was shot and killed in 2015. The move reflected growing tensions between the United States and Russia following allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and a host of other international disagreements. In  1987 , that same stretch of road was designated Andrei Sakharov Plaza, after a Soviet human rights activist who had been placed under internal exile. Russian lawmaker Mikhail Degtyaryov  reportedly responded  to the designation of Boris Nemtsov Plaza by proposing that Moscow assign the US Embassy the address of North American Dead End, 1. Bobby Sands Street, Tehran, Iran Iranian leaders have changed many street names in their capital city since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but perhaps the most pointed change targeted the British government. The city decided to name the street outside the British Embassy -- previously Winston Churchill Boulevard -- after Bobby Sands, an Irish Republican Army member and activist who died from a hunger strike in 1981, sparking protests across Northern Ireland. Ho Chi Minh Street, Kolkata, India During the Vietnam War, the street that houses the US consulate in Kolkata, India, was renamed Ho Chi Minh Street in honor of the communist leader. The West Bengal state has historically  embraced communism , and the road carries the name to this day. Proposed: Liu Xiaobo Plaza, Washington DC Since 2014, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has been pushing legislation to rename the street outside the Chinese Embassy after  Liu Xiaobo , a jailed Nobel Peace Prize-winning human rights campaigner who died in 2017 while on medical parole. The Senate passed a bill to effect the name change in 2016, but the House of Representatives abandoned the effort after a veto threat from the Obama administration. \"We view this kind of legislative action as something that only complicates our efforts,\" deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters at the time, \"so we oppose this approach.\" Andrey Karlov Street, Ankara, Turkey Not all name changes are meant to shame foreign governments. In fact, some can be true olive branches. Take Andrey Karlov Street in Ankara, for example. The road  was renamed  last year to honor the late Russian ambassador, who was killed while speaking at a photo exhibition in 2016. The move recognized Karlov's contributions to Russian-Turkish relations and reflected a warming of ties between the two countries -- even as ties have frayed between Turkey and the United States.

Purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate. Sad!\" Now it appears some within the  Senate GOP are following Trump's lead on dealing (or, more accurately not dealing) with the media .   Right around noon Tuesday, NBC's Kasie Hunt  tweeted this : \"ALERT: Reporters at Capitol have been told they are not allow to film interviews with senators in hallways, contrary to years of precedent.\"  She quickly added : \"CONDITIONS for any interview: Previously granted permission from senator AND Rules Committee of Senate.\" CNN's Manu Raju wrote : \"Senate Rules Committee and @SenateSAA trying to SHUT DOWN press access in halls. No more staking out hearings without permission. Not OK.\" What happened next is a little unclear.  CNN's Dylan Byers reported : Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, the Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, said Tuesday that the Committee had \"made no changes to the existing rules governing press coverage,\" but that it was \"working with the various galleries to ensure compliance with existing rules in an effort to help provide a safe environment for Members of Congress, the press corps, staff, and constituents as they travel from Senate offices to the Capitol.\" But reporters and many Democratic senators viewed the move as an effort to reduce press access and allow senators to conduct public business in private and without accountability. The directive, which was issued by the Senate Radio and Television Correspondents Gallery, comes as Senate Republicans are drafting a health care bill in a process shrouded in secrecy. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, tweeted: \"Just spoke with Senator Shelby. He said he wouldn't move forward on change to press access without consulting me and we must hold him to it.\" By 3:30, reporters like Hunt tweeted that the new interpretation of the rules had been reversed. Even the suggestion of limiting press access on Capitol Hill, amid all of the traditions regarding the media that have been shattered over the past two years, is an eye-popper. And something that would have an immediate -- and negative -- effect on the way reporters interact with elected officials. Having spent a chunk of my time in my late 20s on Capitol Hill, I can tell you that the reason that the Congressional beat is so great as a reporter is the access you get to members of Congress.  On the Senate side, reporters camp out in the hallway outside the chamber as soon as a vote is called (and sometimes in between too).  The senators stream off the elevators right in front of the reporters, allowing any journalist for any publication to ask a question of one of the most powerful politicians in the country. There are rules governing where cameras can be set up, but there is access. Not every senator stops. But, many do. It's a remarkably egalitarian system.  It's what, I think, democracy looks like.  Taking away -- or \"reviewing\" -- reporters' ability to film those interviews and requiring any interaction with a senator to run through the Senate Rules Committee -- would constitute a remarkable abrogation of that interaction between reporters and elected officials.  Within minutes of the news breaking, senators -- Democrats and Republicans -- were condemning the move. \"GOP should respect the 1st Amendment and let reporters do their jobs,\" t weeted Virginia Senator and 2016 vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine . \"More important than ever as Senators try to push through secret bills.\" \"This is a bad idea,\" tweeted Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. \"Of all the problems in America, y'all are pretty down the list,\"  South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters . Here's the thing: You don't need to like the media -- hell, you can hate the media -- to see why any proposed filming ban is a very, very dangerous thing. Without a free and independent media, politicians aren't held accountable.  Power shrouds itself more and more in secrecy. The people paying the politicians' salaries -- We the People -- have less and less ability to know how they are spending their time. Republican, Democrat, Independent, Green, Libertarian or whatever else doesn't matter.  People asking questions -- and, yes, sometimes hard and annoying questions -- is your bulwark against the erosion of democracy.   With stakes that big, even small erosions in press freedom matter. Bigly.","articles_date":"13 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/13\/politics\/senate-press-ban\/index.html","articles_title":"What, exactly, happened between the media and Senate Republicans today?","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":373,"issue":6,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"While he appeals a decision that served him a one-year prison sentence, former coal company executive Don Blankenship has paid his $250,000 fine.

So, who exactly is Sam Nunberg, beyond a former adviser to President Donald Trump's campaign team? Well, he's a man who Trump has hired, fired, rehired, refired and then sued for $10 million.  RELATED: Former Trump aide refusing Mueller subpoena: 'Screw that' A history with Trump of being hired, fired and sued Nunberg was fired in February 2014 by Trump even after offering his resignation. Nunberg convinced Trump to participate in  a BuzzFeed article  that ended up being highly critical of a potential campaign by the real estate mogul. Nunberg was rehired by Trump as a communications adviser in February 2015,  according to The Washington Post .  Then he was  fired again -- this time from the campaign --  in August 2015. The firing came after  Business Insider reported  Nunberg had a history of racially charged and disparaging political posts dating back to 2007 on Facebook. He wrote this, with three dashes, about an upcoming meeting with the Rev. Al Sharpton: \"his daughter is N---!\" And he called President Barack Obama a \"Socialist Marxist Islamo Fascist Nazi Appeaser.\"  Nunberg denied to CNN  at the time that he had written the posts and said \"anything that was posted under my name does not mean I posted it.\" However, he apologized in  a 2017 MSNBC interview . At the time of his second firing, a campaign spokesperson described him as a \"low-level\" staffer. A few months later, in March 2016, Nunberg endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican primary. He said Trump \"does not have a coherent political ideology,\"  according to Politico.  In December 2016, Hope Hicks  shared strong words on Nunberg with Politico . \"He's a highly self-destructive individual who makes routine calls begging for his job back,\" Hicks said to Politico. Her statement was in response to a Nunberg interview where he said he didn't think Trump would win the election.  In July 2016,  Trump sued Nunberg for $10 million , alleging Nunberg breached a confidentiality agreement. At the time, Nunberg's lawyer told CNN that Nunberg was being accused of \"violating certain confidentiality provisions by talking about Donald Trump after he was no longer associated with the campaign.\" Nunberg  \"amicably\" settled the $10 million  lawsuit with Trump in August 2016, CNN reported. A background in law and Roger Stone Nunberg graduated from the Touro Law Center in Long Island, New York,  according to his LinkedIn  profile. For previous experience on LinkedIn, Nunberg listed himself as the New York City chair for \"Students for Mitt\" during the 2008 presidential election while in law school.  He was the deputy director of government affairs for the American Center for Law and Justice, a politically conservative, Christian-based nonprofit organization, from August 2009 to January 2011,  according to a news release . From January 2012 to November 2014,  he was the director  of the Middle East Forum's Legal Project. He graduated from McGill University in Montreal in 2004, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Prior to this week, we only knew -- thanks to CNN reporting -- that Democrats supportive of Clinton had funded the dossier, which was put together by a former British spy named Christopher Steele. Now we know that it was Clinton's campaign, not just Clinton backers, who were ponying up the money to fund the information collection on Trump and Russia. There's still one big mystery here, however: Who was paying for Steele's work during the Republican primary? The Washington Post,  who broke the story of the payment to Fusion GPS by Clinton and the DNC , offered a few clues in their story: Clue #1: \"Fusion GPS's research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primary.\" Clue #2: \"Fusion GPS's work researching Trump began during the Republican presidential primaries, when the GOP donor paid for the firm to investigate the real estate magnate's background.\" That reporting corroborates  this from The New York Times  back in January:  \"The story began in September 2015, when a wealthy Republican donor who strongly opposed Mr. Trump put up the money to hire a Washington research firm run by former journalists, Fusion GPS, to compile a dossier about the real estate magnate's past scandals and weaknesses, according to a person familiar with the effort.\" And, we have some denials of involvement from some of the GOP candidates who ran against Trump in that primary. On CNN's \"New Day\" on Friday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said that his campaign had never paid Fusion GPS for any services. On Thursday, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also denied any involvement in the funding of the dossier. \"As far as whether it was my campaign, it wasn't and I'll tell you why,\"  Rubio said on CNN . \"I was running for president. I was trying to win. If I had anything against Donald Trump that was relevant and credible and politically damaging, I would've used it. I didn't have it.\" In an  August Washington Examiner piece by Byron York , strategists for the super PACs of Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz also denied any involvement in funding the dossier -- or even knowing it existed.  Assuming -- and some Republicans don't -- that this GOP donor actually exists, it's not terribly surprising that none of the major campaigns seem willing to take credit or blame for the dossier. Because this was a project funded by a GOP donor, there's no reason to think that donor was acting at the behest of the campaign. He or she could have simply given the money to Fusion GPS and then doled out -- or planned to dole out -- whatever good nuggets were found to the most viable anti-Trump candidate left in the field. The only possible link I could see between this GOP donor and a campaign is if he or she made contributions to a candidate or a candidate's super PAC -- in addition to the money spent on the Fusion GPS research. Plus, while it was a Republican who brought Fusion GPS into the mix, we don't know, and there is no evidence yet, that Fusion had even retained Steele while it was being paid by the Republican. There's plausible deniability everywhere. The simple fact is this: The identity of the Republican donor who began this whole dossier odyssey is now the last major mystery surrounding a document that has roiled Trump's first year in office.  Will we ever find out who the mysterious donor is? I say yes because, well, my experience in politics (and life) is that everything comes out in the end.","articles_date":"27 10 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/27\/politics\/fusion-gps-gop-donor\/index.html","articles_title":"Who was paying for Fusion GPS' work during the GOP primary?","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":377,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":" (CNN) The Senate finally took action on Tuesday. Not to break the immigration impasse, move forward on guns or hammer out a plan to rebuild the nation's decaying infrastructure.  Instead, a bipartisan group of 67 -- 17 of them members of the Democratic caucus --  voted to advance a bill  that would roll back and revise regulations imposed on banks by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Democratic supporters of the legislation, almost all of them either up for re-election this fall and\/or from red or purple states, insist that its sole purpose is to loose small lenders and community banks from the chains of excessive federal oversight and give a shot of adrenaline to bootstrapping entrepreneurs and business owners. \"Main Street businesses and lenders tell me that they need some regulatory relief if we want jobs in rural America,\" Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who voted for Dodd-Frank (along with  seven other  Democratic supporters of the new bill), said during a hearing in November of last year. \"These folks are not wearing slick suits in downtown New York or Boston. They are farmers, they are small business owners, they are first-time homebuyers.\" That, in a nutshell, is the messaging. The reality is rather less idyllic.  The vast majority of the benefits tucked into the bill, which either unravels or dilutes important pieces of the existing law, rewards, if not the very biggest, then extremely large institutions. Among them, a group typically referred to as \"midsize banks,\" are familiar faces like BB&T, SunTrust and the American outposts of foreign giants like Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and Banco Santander. The latter trio hold relatively smaller assets in the US, so they too would benefit. Before getting into the messy politics here, let's review the policy.  The bill has three main planks: 1) Banks with less than $10 billion in assets would be exempted from the Volcker rule, which put the brakes on certain kinds of risky trading in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis; 2) The list of banks deemed \"too big to fail,\" and thus faced with tighter restrictions, would be thinned by raising the threshold from $50 billion in assets to $250 billion; and 3) One size fits all regulations, even for the mega-banks -- the ones, as Tester put it, with employees \"wearing slick suits in downtown New York or Boston\" -- would be vulnerable to new pressures, with the Federal Reserve now required to work alongside those institutions to customize certain rules. The last piece could set off a race to the bottom, with the largest players on Wall Street demanding more freedom and, if they're denied, being able to point to the competition as evidence to help make their case. But the bulk of the benefits in the bill go to the so-called medium-sized banks. Here,  per CNNMoney's Donna Borak , is what would change for banks with assets up to $250 billion:  \"They would no longer have to hold as much capital to cover losses on their balance sheets. They would not be required to have plans in place to be safely dismantled if they failed. And they would have to take the Fed's bank health test only periodically, not once a year.\" How dangerous would that be? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office weighed in with its take on Monday, before the initial vote, and came to the conclusion that the bill, if passed, would increase the chances of another 2008-style collapse. \"CBO's estimate of the bill's budgetary effect is subject to considerable uncertainty, in part because it depends on the probability in any year that a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) will fail or that there will be a financial crisis,\"  the report says , before adding this considerable caveat (emphasis mine): \"CBO estimates that  the probability is small under current law and would be slightly greater under the legislation .\" Oh, and it would also increase the federal deficit by $671 million. So, why -- as a matter of policy and politics -- would so many Democrats side with Republicans in supporting this bill? For that, we turn to some of its most insistent backers, moderates from Trump states facing re-election this fall. Tester is one, along with Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin of West Virginia are also on board. All of them face tough re-election fights. CNN rates all but Tester's contest in Montana as a \"tossup.\"  \"This legislation would make it easier for Hoosier families to gain access to mortgages and small businesses to access capital,\" Donnelly said in a statement, \"and it also includes important new consumer protections, such as free credit freezes, in response to the Equifax data breach.\" Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is strongly favored in his coming re-election bid, has also talked about \"consolidation of the banking industry in Virginia\" as an unintended consequence of Dodd-Frank's current language. If smaller banks are freer to pursue the business they desire, the theory goes, the more likely they are to thrive on their own. If the policy end of this is, most charitably,  complicated , then the political end seems downright impenetrable. The conventional wisdom going into 2017 was that red state senators might have to stray from the party line every now and again to show off their independence and solidify their standing with the Republican and independent voters who will mostly decide their fates this November. But like so many political assumptions in the Trump era, it was largely disproved. Democrats, most notably in the many fights to preserve Obamacare, stuck together.  With an energized base on their side, and poking at it when they threaten to go wobbly, Democrats are looking at better-than-expected polling and hearing a chorus of canaries singing in GOP coal mines. But with the bank bill, they are showing the limits of that unity -- and offering up some jarring, if fundamentally unsurprising, insight into where their priorities lie. The loudest criticism of the bank bill in Washington has come from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who is eyeing a White House run in 2020, and has seen the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau she crafted as part of Dodd-Frank undermined by the administration. Democrats might have used their leverage here to backstop the CFPB, but never made it a sticking point. A frustrated Warren on Tuesday  tweeted out the names  of the Democrats who voted to advance the bill, and added this: \"Senate Republicans voted unanimously for the #BankLobbyistAct. But this bill wouldn't be on the path to becoming law without the support of these Democrats. The Senate just voted to increase the chances your money will be used to bail out big banks again.\" The CBO report said as much, so this was hardly a cheap shot. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who's another vocal critic and 2020 contender, asked in a statement, \"Are our memories so short that we have learned nothing from (the 2007-2008 financial) disaster?\" This bill, he added, would \"lay the groundwork for another massive financial collapse.\" Neither Sanders nor Warren impugned their colleagues' motives or political savvy. Maybe they should have. Because the politics here don't make much sense. It's true that Trump was elected, in part, on a platform of economic populism. For all that's happened since, that hasn't changed. The idea, then, that red state voters would turn on a Democrat who voted against a gift to the financial sector simply doesn't compute. Where in the past this kind of deal might have passed relatively unnoticed, the current state of heightened awareness, especially among liberals, will make that impossible. Hence the leadership's opposition, even if they don't seem to be whipping others to follow. However it plays out, a swift backlash isn't guaranteed, but  increased suspicion and cynicism going forward are a good bet.  And for Democrats, in 2018 but especially when it comes time to challenge Trump, that might be the most dangerous thing of all.","articles_date":"8 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/08\/politics\/why-democrats-supporting-republican-bank-bill\/index.html","articles_title":"Why are (some) Democrats signing on to the Republican bank bill?","candidate_fk":4,"first_name":"Joe","id":378,"issue":6,"last_name":"Manchin","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":" (CNN) The Senate finally took action on Tuesday. Not to break the immigration impasse, move forward on guns or hammer out a plan to rebuild the nation's decaying infrastructure.  Instead, a bipartisan group of 67 -- 17 of them members of the Democratic caucus --  voted to advance a bill  that would roll back and revise regulations imposed on banks by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Democratic supporters of the legislation, almost all of them either up for re-election this fall and\/or from red or purple states, insist that its sole purpose is to loose small lenders and community banks from the chains of excessive federal oversight and give a shot of adrenaline to bootstrapping entrepreneurs and business owners. \"Main Street businesses and lenders tell me that they need some regulatory relief if we want jobs in rural America,\" Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who voted for Dodd-Frank (along with  seven other  Democratic supporters of the new bill), said during a hearing in November of last year. \"These folks are not wearing slick suits in downtown New York or Boston.

His latest book is \" New and Collected Poems, 1975-2015 .\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN) The contrast could not be more extreme:  a loud, pushy, anti-intellectual President Donald Trump versus a soft-spoken, recessive, philosophical former president, Barack Obama.   The difference has become especially glaring in recent days, with Trump repeatedly breaking the tradition of a new president refraining from dissing his predecessor.   Trump has, in fact, gone out of his way to attack Obama, as in his recent nonsensical reversal  wherein he attacked Obama  for his lack of response to Russian meddling in the 2016 election:  \"Obama did NOTHING,\"  Trump tweeted.   He went on to accuse Obama of colluding with the Russians!   By now the world is familiar with this Trump ploy:  He engages in  unscrupulous business deals , so he labels Hillary Clinton \"Crooked Hillary.\"   He lies,  so he calls Ted Cruz \"Lyin' Ted.\"  On and on.  Anyone who calls him out on any failure gets the same accusation hurled back in his or her face, and -- to a shocking extent -- this trick works.  Or it works with Trump supporters, who don't seem to care if he wrecks their health care, allows factories to poison their water, or provides massive tax cuts for the rich people they admire so much.  THIS is making America great again. The truth is, Obama confronted Putin directly about intervening in our political system and put in place sanctions, though he clearly didn't do enough.  \"I feel like we sort of choked,\" one former colleague of Obama has said,  according to an article in the Washington Post .   This is too bad, as the Russians pulled off the crime of the century, possibly derailing Clinton, a tough critic of Russia. Today we have an incompetent President who (for reasons we might discover soon enough) appears unwilling to oppose the Russian regime.   Obama's weak responses to Trump have been troubling.  I don't know why he didn't simply open the intelligence files on Putin to the American public, saying:  \"My God, look what the Russians are trying to do!  Put up your guard!\"  There can be no sound reason for not alerting the people of this country to a major attack on their most cherished right, the right to vote. I'm also unhappy about Obama's response to Trumpcare.  His language was strong enough: \"The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill,\" he wrote in a Facebook post, blasting the Republican legislation that seeks to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.  He  calls the proposed Republican plan  \"a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.\" That is exactly what he should have said, but why is he only saying it in a Facebook post rather than in remarks to the press or in speeches. Again and again, Trump strikes and Obama turns the other cheek.  What's going on here? There is a longstanding Christian tradition of turning the other cheek, and that's usually the best approach to abuse.  But one should remember that Jesus also turned over the tables of merchants and moneychangers in Herod's Temple in Jerusalem.  He accused them of transforming the holiest site in Judaism into a \"den of thieves.\" (Mark 11:17)  I wonder if the analogy here, with Trump and his cohorts, isn't more apt than we think.   A friend of mine recently suggested that Obama was, at heart, a quietist.  This is a  mystical tradition  that involves a \"quieting\" of the conscious mind, a withdrawal into the deepest layers of self, even self-annihilation.   Political quietism involves stepping back from the activities of the world to focus on religious truth, and it condemns self-aggrandizement and the naked reach for power.  It rejects the quest for wealth.   But quietism seems misguided in this context.  Political life is where we create a community.  What is government but our community made visible?  If we are to create a community that takes pride in how it cares for its own, one that promotes decent values, such as humility and tolerance and the wish to share, we have no choice but to step forward, to declare ourselves and speak up for our values. Obama needs to find his voice now in ways that, during his time in the Oval Office, he was too often reluctant to do, perhaps fearing the immense power of the bully pulpit But now there is a real bully in the pulpit, and Obama -- like the rest of us -- has no choice but to speak, and to act.  My hope for Obama is that, in his post-presidency, he steps forward boldly to say whatever feels true in his mind.  And he must do so in the most public ways.  I would urge him to speak up, not indirectly on Facebook, but to declare himself more publicly and without reservation, revealing his ideas, his passions.  There may be some fatal flaw here, of course, one that disallows a full-throated singing of his song.  But I hope it isn't so.","articles_date":"28 6 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/27\/opinions\/obama-nonresponse-to-trump-parini\/index.html","articles_title":"Why isn't Obama hitting back at Trump?","candidate_fk":15,"first_name":"Ted","id":380,"issue":6,"last_name":"Cruz","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Texas"},{"article_text":"Washington (CNN) Tuesday night was very big for Democrats  as the party won the governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey and scored a series of other victories from Maine to Washington State that suggests the forces opposed to President Donald Trump turned up in large numbers to send a message that they weren't happy with how he is doing the job. Democrats -- and Governors-elect Ralph Northam (Virginia) and Phil Murphy (New Jersey) in particular -- were big winners. But who were some of the less obvious winners -- and losers! -- on Tuesday? That's where I come in!  Below are my picks for the best and the worst of the night that was. WINNERS *  Ralph   Northam : In both the Democratic primary earlier this year and again Tuesday night, Northam overperformed expectations. There were lots and lots of Northam doubters in Democratic circles -- he's too boring! He won't sell in northern Virginia! -- I talked to in the final 72 hours of the race. But Northam's country doctor routine worked its magic again. Northam may well be the most underrated politician of the year. And kudos to his campaign team -- led by manager Brad Komar -- for running a race that was both true to Northam's centrist roots and a winner. *  Terry McAuliffe : The outgoing Virginia governor is a popular presence in the state and Northam, generally speaking, ran on a message of continuing the McAuliffe legacy. It worked. And McAuliffe, because he's McAuliffe, was quick to take credit for it in an interview with CNN even before the results were known. If you don't think Tuesday's results in Virginia don't make it more likely McAuliffe runs for president in 2020, you don't know Terry. *  Doug Jones : If there was any question about  whether national Democrats should fund Jones' special Senate election race  later this year against Roy Moore in Alabama, Tuesday night's results probably took care of that. Given the activation of the Democratic base -- particularly non-white voters -- and Moore's divisiveness, Jones looks like less of a long shot today than he did Tuesday. *  Joe Biden : The former vice president was very active on the stump for 2017 Democratic candidates -- including Northam, Murphy and Jones in Alabama. During a visit to Virginia for Northam in mid-October,  Biden told the crowd : \"You have to win to ... give people hope we are not falling into this know-nothing pit.\" And, in the wake of the election results Tuesday night,  Biden tweeted this : \"A resounding defeat tonight for President Trump. Voters around the country rejected the ugly politics we have seen this past year. Instead, they chose candidates who unite and inspire us.\" Sounds a lot like a line from a Biden 2020 speech, no? *  Donna Brazile : If Northam had lost or Democrats more broadly would have underwhelmed at the ballot box on Tuesday, the story of Democratic division -- and Brazile's new book that lays much of it bare -- would be the only thing that people would be talking about. Now, there's a much better narrative for Democrats out there and the  inconsistencies between Brazile's book and her recent public statements  about the campaign are likely to recede into the background. *  NoVa suburbs : The winning formula for Democrats in Virginia is now shockingly simple: Run up the score -- bigly -- in northern Virginia. Northam beat Gillespie by 212,000 votes in Arlington (+52,000), Fairfax (+137,000) and Loudoun (+23,000). His statewide margin? Two-hundred and thirty-two thousand votes.  *  Tom Perriello : The former congressman lost his primary challenge to Northam earlier this year. Rather than remain embittered and sitting out the rest of the race,   Perriello signed out with an political organization -- Win Virginia -- that aimed to reduce Republicans' 66-34 edge in the state Assembly . Led by Perriello, Democrats did much more than that; a real possibility exists that they will hold 50 seats in the Assembly when all the votes are counted. That's a stunning achievement. *  Virginia Department of Elections : The vote count was amazingly fast. And the  website  allows you to search back to 1789 in its election results data. I mean, that rules. LOSERS *  Donald Trump : The President tweeted shortly after Gillespie's loss insisting that if the GOP nominee had only hewed closer to him, the results might have been different. There's simply no empirical evidence in exit polling or the raw data that suggests that contention to be true. Half of the Virginia voters said Trump was a factor in their vote on Tuesday, with twice as many saying they wanted to send Trump a message of opposition as said they wanted to send him a message of support. In places like Loudoun and Chesterfield counties -- exurban and suburban, respectively -- Gillespie badly underperformed past GOP nominees. Adjusting for all variables, it's hard not to see how that difference is primarily attributable to Trump. *  \"Trumpism without Trump\" : In the hours leading up to polls closing in Virginia, the idea -- floated by former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon -- that Gillespie would prove you could run and win on Trump's idea if you took Trump's personality out of the equation was rampant. Then Gillespie got trounced. What Tuesday night in Virginia showed is that most voters outside of the GOP base simply don't distinguish between support for Trump personally and support for Trump's agenda.  It's all the same to them. And it's bad. *  Chris Christie : The election results in New Jersey were a sort of final nail in Christie's political coffin. Christie's lieutenant governor -- Kim Guadagno -- was swamped under by the historic unpopularity of Christie. Just 22% of New Jersey voters approved of how Christie has handled his job. Among those who strongly disapproved of Christie, Murphy won 81% of the vote. Guadagno tried to run away from Christie and his toxic legacy in the state but it didn't work. Christie now faces a political future filled with not-so-good options. He almost certainly can't run for office in New Jersey for a very long time to come and his close association with Trump has hurt him badly in the eyes of GOP establishment types. Christie's best hope is some sort of gig in the White House -- a real possibility given the staff carousel in the Trump administration. *  Paul LePage : The Maine governor repeatedly vetoed efforts by the state legislature to take federal Medicaid expansion dollars under Obamacare. On Tuesday, a  ballot measure passed overwhelmingly that will allow 80,000 more Mainers to join Medicaid . LePage is term-limited out of office next year anyway but has repeatedly floated the idea of running for Senate or some other office. Tuesday's results throw a monkey wrench into those plans. LePage, as of Wednesday morning, was saying he would refuse to implement Medeicaid expansion even after Tuesday's vote. Which is odd. *  Bernie Sanders : The Vermont independent weighed into the Virginia Democratic primary for Perriello.  After Perriello lost, Sanders disappeared. He didn't endorse Northam, who was more centrist-minded than Perriello (and Sanders). \"Our Revolution,\" the political organization that grew out of Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, didn't get involved for Northam either. That's not a good look Wednesday morning, with Democrats celebrating their best election night since 2012. *  The Republican brand : In Virginia, just 30% of the electorate identified as Republicans. In New Jersey, it was just 29%. That gave self-identifying Democrats a double digit edge in each of those states -- suggesting that Republicans didn't turn out to vote or just didn't want to tell an exit pollster they identified with the Republican party. Either way, it's not good if you are a Republican strategist trying to figure out how to win in 2018. *  Barbara Comstock : Comstock has held the 10th district, which includes much of the affluent suburbs stretching west from Washington, DC since 2014. The size of the Northam victory in and around Comstock -- he carried her seat by 13 points -- has to make her one of Democrats' top targets heading into 2018. Comstock might want to rethink her decision to pass on a challenge to Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine next year.","articles_date":"8 11 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/11\/08\/politics\/2017-election-winners-losers\/index.html","articles_title":"Winners and losers from the 2017 election","candidate_fk":11,"first_name":"Tim","id":381,"issue":8,"last_name":"Kaine","newspaper_name":"CNN","source_fk":1,"state_fk":"Virginia"},{"article_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Momentous arguments inside the West Wing over the future of the Paris climate accord became a messy public spectacle on Wednesday, with some aides saying that President Trump had decided to abandon the landmark global warming agreement while others insisted that no decision had been made. Three administration officials with direct knowledge of the intense White House debate said early Wednesday morning that Mr. Trump was expected to withdraw the United States from the 2015  climate change  accord that committed nearly every nation to take action to curb the warming of the planet. In addition, three other officials said later Wednesday that they expected him to withdraw from the agreement, though they said that decision could still change. Hours later, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had made his decision and would announce it in the Rose Garden at 3 p.m. Thursday. The White House\u2019s legislative affairs office has suggested another route: Sending the Paris agreement to the Senate for ratification as a treaty. Since it would require an impossible two-thirds vote, that alternative would also lead to withdrawal. Other White House insiders disputed those reports, saying that no verdict had been reached. Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, offered only that \u201cI\u2019m hearing from a lot of people, both ways,\u201d and promised a decision \u201cvery soon.\u201d With the world watching nervously, the feuding among the president\u2019s aides further exposed the fault lines of a chaotic decision-making process that has swirled around Mr. Trump since he took office. Signs have been increasing for weeks that Mr. Trump was heading toward pulling out of the Paris agreement, apparently believing that a continued United States presence in the accord would harm the economy; hinder job creation in regions like Appalachia and the West, where his most ardent supporters live; and undermine his \u201cAmerica first\u201d message. At home, he faced urgent pleas from corporate leaders, including Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, who told Mr. Trump on Tuesday that pulling out was wrong for business, the economy and the environment. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, threatened to resign from two White House advisory boards if the president withdrew from the Paris agreement. On his recent trip to Europe, Mr. Trump waved aside a barrage of private lobbying by other heads of state to keep the United States in the agreement. A frustrated Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said he opposed \u201cbehaving as vassals of the Americans\u201d and assailed Mr. Trump for failing to even understand the mechanics of a withdrawal, which he said could take three or four years to fulfill. \u201cThis notion \u2014 \u2018I am Trump. I am American. America first, so I\u2019m going to get out of it.\u2019 \u2014 that is not going to happen,\u201d Mr. Juncker said. \u201cWe tried to make that clear to Mr. Trump in clear, German principal clauses in Taormina, but it would appear that he did not understand.\u201d He added, \u201cNot everything in international agreements is fake news.\u201d Mr. Trump has shown a willingness to shift direction up until the moment of a public announcement. He met on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who has advocated that the United States remain a part of the Paris accord. Other advisers pressing Mr. Trump to remain were furiously making their case. In the past, such appeals have worked. In April, Mr. Trump was set to announce a withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement, but at the last minute changed his mind after intense discussions with advisers and calls from the leaders of Canada and Mexico. Last week, a senior administration official said Mr. Trump would use a speech in Brussels to explicitly endorse NATO\u2019s Article 5 mutual defense provision, which states that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all. He did not. The exit of the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas polluter, would not dissolve the 195-nation pact, which was legally ratified last year, but it could set off a cascade of events that would have profound effects on the planet. Other countries that reluctantly joined the agreement could now withdraw or soften their commitments to cutting planet-warming pollution. \u201cThe actions of the United States are bound to have a ripple effect in other emerging economies that are just getting serious about climate change, such as India, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton, and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group that produces scientific reports aimed at informing global policy makers. Once the fallout settles, he added, \u201cit is now far more likely that we will breach the danger limit of 3.6 degrees\u201d \u2014 the average atmospheric temperature increase above which a future of extreme conditions is considered irrevocable. The aim of the Paris agreement was to lower planet-warming emissions enough to avoid that threshold. \u201cWe will see more extreme heat, damaging storms, coastal flooding and risks to food security,\u201d Professor Oppenheimer said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the kind of world we want to live in.\u201d Foreign policy experts said the move could damage the United States\u2019 credibility and weaken Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to negotiate issues far beyond climate change, like trade and terrorism. \u201cFrom a foreign policy perspective, it\u2019s a colossal mistake \u2014 an abdication of American leadership,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a retired career diplomat and an under secretary of state for President George W. Bush. \u201cThe success of our foreign policy \u2014 in trade, military, any other kind of negotiation \u2014 depends on our credibility,\u201d Mr. Burns said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more destructive to our credibility than this.\u201d But Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, particularly coal-state Republicans, have cheered the move, celebrating it as a fulfillment of a signature campaign promise. Speaking to a crowd of oil rig workers last year, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d the agreement, and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, has pushed the president to withdraw from the accord as part of an economic nationalism that has so far included pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade pact, and vowing to renegotiate Nafta. Coal miners and coal company executives in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia have pushed for Mr. Trump to reverse all of President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change policies, many of which are aimed at reducing the use of coal, considered the largest contributor to climate change. In a May 23 letter to Mr. Trump from Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia and nine other state attorneys general, Mr. Morrisey wrote, \u201cWithdrawing from the Paris agreement is an important and necessary step toward reversing the harmful energy policies and unlawful overreach of the Obama era.\u201d He added, \u201cThe Paris agreement is a symbol of the Obama administration\u2019s \u2018Washington knows best\u2019 approach to governing.\u201d Although the administration has been debating its position on the Paris agreement for months, the sentiment for leaving appears to have the upper hand over the views of Mr. Tillerson and Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and close adviser. Other countries have vowed to continue to carry out the terms of the Paris agreement, even without the United States. President Xi Jinping of China, the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas polluter, has promised that his country will move ahead with steps to curb climate change, regardless of what happens in the United States. During a telephone call in early May with President Emmanuel Macron of France, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Mr. Xi told the newly elected French leader that China and France \u201cshould protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement.\u201d But the accord\u2019s architects say the absence of the United States will inevitably weaken its chances of being enforced. For example, the country has played a central role in pushing provisions that require robust and transparent oversight of how emissions are monitored, verified and reported. Without the United States, there is likely to be far less pressure on major polluting countries and industries to accurately report their emissions. There have been major questions raised about the accuracy of China\u2019s emissions reporting, in particular. \u201cWe need to know: What are your emissions? Where are your emissions?\u201d said Todd D. Stern, the lead climate negotiator during the Obama administration. \u201cThere needs to be transparent reporting on countries\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions. If the U.S. is not part of that negotiation, that\u2019s a loss for the world.\u201d","articles_date":"31 5 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/05\/31\/climate\/trump-quits-paris-climate-accord.html","articles_title":"World Awaits Trump Decision on U.S. Future in Paris Accord","candidate_fk":5,"first_name":"Patrick","id":382,"issue":1,"last_name":"Morrisey","newspaper_name":"NYT","source_fk":3,"state_fk":"West_Virginia"},{"article_text":"A former coal industry worker plans to challenge West Virginia Sen.

Copley gained nationwide popularity when he questioned Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton about her stance on coal at a roundtable discussion at a local health clinic in Williamson in the spring of 2016.  Fast forward a few months and Copley, a former employee in the coal industry, said he felt a strong spiritual force urging him to run for political office. He announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in May of last year.  Copley will face current U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins of Huntington and current W.Va. Attorney General Patrick Morrissey in the May primary election. Now former coal executive Don Blankenship has thrown his hat into the ring, which makes for a crowded field. The GOP winner will likely face incumbent U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who also has served as the Mountain State's governor. Manchin has some opposition in the Democratic primary, but is expected to be his party's nominee.  All four of those candidates have huge campaign funds. In contrast, Copley, who was laid off in September 2015 from Arch Coal, has a grassroots campaign underway. He realizes he won't have the big budgets the other candidates have, but he isn't worried.  \"I've run into several people who have said, 'You're not going to be able to compete with them,' \" Copley said. \"But I try to point out to them that money doesn't win a race - it's votes. If enough people are tired of seeing candidates win because they have more money or they have corporate people in their back pockets - we are giving them another option.\"  He wants people in the state to get a different mindset.  \"I'm not going to get the backing from corporate representatives, and I'm not going to get huge donations from people who are going to expect favors in return. We are getting most of our money from everyday people,\" Copley said of his working-class candidacy. He said he would never ask the salt of the earth type citizens to donate to his campaign because he knows how it is like to live check to check. But, he says when he gets $25 or $50 from someone - \"it says a lot. I know at the end of the day people are going to look back and say, 'He is one of us.' \"  \"We are giving voters a chance to get away from the stereotypical candidate,\" Copley added.  The Mingo County native said he recently joked at an event in Harrison County, which was also attended by Morrisey. \"When I got up to speak, I asked if anyone else wanted to throw their hat into the ring before we get started.\"  The filing period for West Virginia candidates begins Monday, Jan. 8, and ends Saturday, Jan. 27.  \"Everyone has the opportunity to run,\" Copley said. He said if everyone stays in the race, he thinks it will help him in the long run. \"That brings down the total number of votes you need to win,\" he said of the crowded GOP race. \"For someone like myself that is underfunded - it can help me.\"  Copley will likely get support from the evangelical population of the state.  \"I think people in our state, that aren't necessarily Christians in our state, still respect those values,\" Copley said. \"I'm not saying I'm better than any other person - by no means. We need to get people to elect candidates not based on their political affiliations or because of their name recognition. We hope they will vote for people because of their character and what they stand for.\"  Copley, 40, of Lenore, hopes to be the Republican candidate to challenge Manchin in the 2018 U.S. Senate general election. Copley said what makes him different is that he knows what it's like to be unemployed and sees the struggles coal mining families and others in Appalachia have had in order to make ends meet.  \"My entire life I have watched people run for these offices that have no idea how it is to live payday to payday,\" Copley said. \"They don't know what most of us live through each day. You can call that grassroots - but honestly it is just a common sense choice. Do you want someone who has a similar background and that has worked every day?\"  He discussed how President Donald Trump was able to gain support and win the nomination and then the presidency. Copley said it is a good example that voters may be changing their views on the types of candidates they want to support. \"He definitely wasn't the conventional candidate.  \"People are tired of career politicians. They want average citizens to run for these offices. I don't think you get more average everyday than myself,\" he said with a smile.  Copley said one positive came from losing his job in the mining industry. It has helped him spend more time with his wife and kids. He also volunteers at a private Christian school, Ambassador Christian Academy in Williamson. He said he had been working 11 to 12 hours a day and missed a lot of time with his family.  \"I felt like I was at a place where God would open the door for me. It is hard for people who are not believers to understand where I come from,\" Copley said. \"I felt like He would show me the right opportunity. I didn't know that this was the opportunity he was going to present to me.\"  Of his underdog status, Copley said his chances are \"better than ever.\"  \"It would be easy to sit back and look at the campaign funds they have and at their experience - but in today's world, that experience is as much a handicap as it is a benefit.  \"I think in May there are going to be a lot of people who are surprised. But I'm not going to be one of them,\" Copley said.  According to Copley's issue statements on his campaign website, he pledges to \"promote coal, oil and gas as the common sense solutions to America's energy needs\" and work for immigration reform. On health care, he says he opposes Obamacare but will \"fight for affordable health care for all West Virginia families and work to re-introduce competition in the marketplace.\"  Copley favors tax reform, opposes abortion and says he will work to protect the West Virginia environment.","articles_date":"5 1 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.williamsondailynews.com\/news\/bo-copley-talks-about-his-senate-campaign\/article_d0e31758-6866-50b5-93bb-8b70de1c3e71.html","articles_title":"Bo Copley talks about his Senate campaign","candidate_fk":2,"first_name":"Bo","id":385,"issue":1,"last_name":"Copley","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 A former Mingo County coal miner, vying for the seat of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), says he wants to represent the thousands of West Virginians impacted by the downturn in coal.  \u201cWho would be better to run against someone that people have had enough of then somebody who is the exact opposite?\u201d said Bo Copley in an interview with MetroNews Wednesday.

On \"Fox & Friends,\" Copley said Trump is doing his best to revitalize the coal industry, which was devastated by the Obama administration.  He said he's already seen evidence on the ground of the industry making a turnaround, as coal companies look for more workers and coal transport increases.  \"The little nuisances that we thought were nuisances - being behind 18-wheelers hauling our product or being caught behind coal trains - we got kind of used to them not being on the roads and being on the tracks anymore.

The four underdog candidates also generally skipped out on TV broadcasts and direct mailers.  Bo Copley, Jack Newbrough and Tom Willis, Republican primary candidates, said they\u2019ve been left at the margin. They say the polls that decided who makes the debates favor the establishment candidates, and they deserve a fair shake.  Likewise, they say the leading contenders, Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va., state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, all have so much political baggage that they may leave room for an outside candidate to eke in.  However, all the Republican candidates had at least one debate to make their case, a luxury not afforded to Paula Jean Swearengin, who is facing Sen. Joe Manchin in the Democratic primary.  The Gazette-Mail spoke to the lesser-known candidates in the primary over the past week to tell their stories.  Tom Willis Tom Willis was not featured on a debate aired by WSAZ-TV, but his hat was.  \u201cThe hat is because Tom Willis is not here based on surveys I\u2019m not sure are independent,\u201d Blankenship said from under a white \u201cTom Willis for U.S. Senate\u201d baseball cap. \u201cHe\u2019s a veteran, he\u2019s a good guy, he deserves an equal chance to unseat the entitlement, or establishment, if you will.\u201d  Explaining the unusual choice of political apparel from an adversary, Willis said he had been talking to Blankenship at a political luncheon earlier in the day and teased that he had a special gift for him \u2014 the now infamous hat. Blankenship said he\u2019d wear it, which Willis called a noble gesture, but didn\u2019t think it would happen.  \u201cI thought for sure his staff, there\u2019s no way they\u2019d let him go on with that hat,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not expect to see it, really. But sure enough, he showed up and he wore it.\u201d  Before launching his campaign, Willis worked as a tax attorney for Baker & McKenzie, a multinational law firm. He left to enlist in the National Guard, starting as an enlisted infantryman and working up to his current rank and role as a major and a Green Beret.  After leaving the firm, Willis worked as a venture capitalist and as the current co-owner of the historic Glen Ferris Inn. He continues to serve in the Guard.  Willis isn\u2019t shy to vent about his treatment in the election. He says polling conducted by Fox News and GOPAC are establishment-centered, used to stifle outside threats.  \u201cThe system really is rigged to favor incumbents, to favor people in the establishment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe media, naturally, is biased toward giving them more credibility. The chattering class, if you will, the chattering class talks to the media, the media talks to the chattering class and talks to the establishment candidates, and it just goes around in a circle.\u201d  Between his military experience, work as a tax attorney and know-how in the business world, Willis said he is as qualified as the leading three, minus the dirt built up from years in politics, lobbying or criminal convictions.  Jack Newbrough The 2018 Senate campaign did not kill Jack Newbrough, but it came close.  After watching the WSAZ-TV debate, stressed and exhausted from campaign travels, Newbrough woke up around 3 a.m. feeling a \u201cheaviness\u201d in his chest.  The Navy veteran and truck driver checked himself into a VA health facility, then a full hospital where doctors told him he suffered a minor heart attack with 40 percent blockage \u2014 below the threshold for needing a stent.  The diagnosis came on a Wednesday. He showed up at a GOP dinner in Kanawha County that Friday.  \u201cI feel fine, I played golf yesterday,\u201d he said before a debate April 30.  He used a cart in lieu of walking the greens. He said his drives were on, but his short-game was off.  Newbrough has proven to be the cowboy of the race. While discussing gun rights at a debate in Wheeling, he said he\u2019s the only candidate on stage who was actually carrying a firearm at the time. That was before he advocated waterboarding people convicted of dealing drugs.  \u201cIt was a figure of speech. I didn\u2019t think it would be taken literally,\u201d he said before a debate in which he repeated the idea.  While an unfeasible solution for several reasons, Newbrough said it came up because the opioid epidemic hits close to home for him. He lost his wife, and his son lost his mother, to an opioid addiction.  Adding to his wildcard style, he said at the debate his number one goal is to make sure Morrisey does not win the nomination. He said he will not back Morrisey. Prior to the debate, he said every other candidate in the race, along with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., sent him wishes for good health while he was in the hospital \u2014 every candidate besides Morrisey.  He said Willis even visited him in person.  Morrisey did, however, issue his condolences on Twitter.  Newbrough said he would be a senator in touch with the people who would protect Americans\u2019 gun rights and protect the right to life.  Bo Copley Fox has Bo Copley polling at 2 percent, but the former coal miner is still feeling confident.  \u201cEverywhere we go, we run into more people saying, \u2018I really like what you have to say,\u2019\u201d he said.  Copley found himself in the spotlight during the 2016 presidential primary when he scored an invite to a roundtable-style campaign event for Hillary Clinton.  There, he challenged Clinton for saying \u201cwe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d  Reading the full quote, in context, it\u2019s clear Clinton was talking about using renewable energy as a vessel to bring economic opportunity to areas suffering from the loss of coal jobs. Nonetheless, the incident underscored the trouble Clinton had connecting with voters in Appalachian areas and a personal distaste for her brand that lingers today.  He pointed to the spat as evidence that he\u2019s not afraid of anyone, but can treat those he disagrees with in a civil and respectful manner.  \u201cI don\u2019t care who I\u2019m faced with, when it comes to my state and it comes to my home, I\u2019ll stand up to anyone in this country the way that I did with Hillary,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do it in a respectful manner, people will hear what you have to say.\u201d  Copley said a lot of people don\u2019t like any of the three leading candidates. His real challenge is finding those people and letting them know he\u2019s out there.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry about polls, don\u2019t worry about who matches up better, voting is about you and what suits you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever your needs are, you need to vote according to your needs. The rest will shake out.\u201d  Paula Jean Swearengin \u201cThe working class needs working class representation, I\u2019ve said that over and over and over,\u201d Paula Jean Swearengin said Friday of her senatorial campaign.  Beating Manchin in a primary, Swearengin said, will be a bigger challenge than beating whoever wins the Republican primary.  Running on a platform that includes a push for renewable energy jobs, union support and campaign finance reform, the irony of the chance she runs against Blankenship, who fought unions for years in the mining industry and has a track record of environmental pollution, has not escaped her.  \u201cHe rightfully needs his butt kicked by a coal miner\u2019s daughter,\u201d Swearengin said of Blankenship.  Though Manchin said publicly that he would debate Swearengin during the primary, it has never happened.  Swearengin said this lack of debate was a political calculation.  \u201cI think that it\u2019s telling that Joe Manchin won\u2019t debate me, because I think that he\u2019s afraid that I\u2019ll get more name recognition,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest challenge is name recognition in this campaign.\u201d  Along with the policy differences, Swearengin said Manchin needs to be taken to task for his role in propping up Gov. Jim Justice in his 2016 election, before he switched to the Republican party in 2017.  Swearengin is the only candidate in the race pushing a Medicare-for-all plan. She said she\u2019s confident in her chances.  More than any party affiliation, she said her authenticity as a member of and advocate for the working class will span any political divide in the state.  Backing Swearengin is Brand New Congress, a PAC formed by veterans of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, though that\u2019s not her only run-in with the senator from Vermont. A video of her chatting with Sanders that ends in a tender hug made the rounds during the presidential campaign.","articles_date":"5 5 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.wvgazettemail.com\/election_2018\/congress_2018\/lesser-known-wv-candidates-in-us-senate-race-make-their\/article_9d6c0499-6d25-5754-9ef7-75b06061cfce.html","articles_title":"Lesser-known WV candidates in US Senate race make their case","candidate_fk":6,"first_name":"Jack","id":389,"issue":3,"last_name":"Newbrough","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"Jack Newbrough, one of the candidates running for the Republican nomination to challenge West Virginia Sen.

(WCHS\/WVAH) \u2014 President Donald Trump tweeted his thoughts on the U.S. Senate race Monday morning, steering voters away from Don Blankenship. Blankenship responded in a statement, vowing that he will win the primary and then go on to defeat incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in the fall.  \u201cTo the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cProblem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can\u2019t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!\u201d  Blankenship is running against five other GOP candidates in the primary election Tuesday including Bo Copley, Tom Willis, Evan Jenkins, Patrick Morrisey and Jack Newbrough.  One of those candidates, Newbrough, on Monday threw his support behind Blankenship in the primary because he denounces Mitch McConnell, the U.S. Senate Majority leader. He also said he believes there are too many attorneys in Congress.  \u201cMr. Blankenship speaks his heart, and I believe he was really treated unfairly in the UBB explosion,\u201d Newbrough said in a statement. \u201cI believe he will work for the West Virginia people and drain the swamp just like President Trump wants. I love West Virginia, and he will do West Virginia right. Who goes to prison on a misdemeanor?\u201d  Blankenship is the former CEO of Massey Energy. He announced his run for Senate last November. He served a year in prison for his conviction for misdemeanor conspiracy to violate federal safety standards at a West Virginia mine where 29 miners died in 2010. Blankenship has long maintained his innocence.  Morrisey was quick to agree with Trump, tweeting he is \"exactly right. @DonBlankenship would be a disaster for West Virginia and would get trounced by @Sen_JoeManchin.\"  Blankenship issued a statement in response to the president's tweet, saying Trump is \"a very busy man and he doesn\u2019t know me, and he doesn\u2019t know how flawed my two main opponents are in this primary.\"  \"The establishment is misinforming him because they do not want me to be in the U.S. Senate and promote the president\u2019s agenda,\" Blankenship continued in his statement. \"West Virginians are not going to vote for candidates who have failed to address the drug epidemic, aligned themselves with abortionists, and have never created a job. I will win the primary and I will beat Joe Manchin.  \"West Virginians want more jobs, an end to the drug epidemic, and an honest government. I will will do the job that Morrisey and Jenkins can\u2019t do and have not done. I am the only candidate that has beaten Joe Manchin, and I have done it twice. In the history of West Virginia, no one has been more supportive of the Republican Party and conservative causes than I have been. Neither of my opponents can beat Joe Manchin without my support, but I will beat Joe Manchin even without the support of the establishment.  \"West Virginia voters should remember that my enemies are Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and my opponents would not even be running as Republicans had I not resurrected the Republican Party in West Virginia. Tomorrow, West Virginia will send the swamp a message\u2014no one, and I mean no one, will tell us how to vote. As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump and this morning proves it.\"  One of Blankenship\u2019s most recent campaign ads takes a jab at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Eyewitness News I-Team did a fact check of the ad, which many are concerned is racist.  Donald Trump Jr. tweeted last week West Virginia voters should \u201creject Blankenship.\u201d  \u201cI hate to lose,\u201d the tweet posted on May 3 said. \u201cSo I'm gonna go out on a limb here and ask the people of West Virginia to make a wise decision and reject Blankenship!

They decided they would treat me with medication.  \u201cThey released me \u2014 but with a bunch of medications,\u201d he said.  He was planning to attend a Kanawha County Lincoln Day Dinner on Friday night in Charleston, then return to Weirton.  Newbrough, 48, a truck driver from Weirton, has been given clearance by his doctors to drive a car and he will be able to drive himself home. He is not, however, permitted to drive his rig for two weeks.  Newbrough said after Monday night\u2019s debate, he went to on Tuesday to events in Beckley and Huntington.  At about 3 a.m. Wednesday, he said he awoke in his hotel room with \u201ca heavy feeling\u201d but not pain.  \u201cThere was a lot of pressure on my chest,\u201d he said. \u201cI drove myself to the emergency room at (the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Huntington). They don\u2019t do heart catherizations there, so they sent me to St. Mary\u2019s.  \u201cI never had any pain, just an uncomfortable feeling,\u201d he said.  Doctors at the St. Mary Medical Center told Newbrough he had to quit smoking, and he said he hasn\u2019t had a cigarette in three days.  He said four of the five other candidates in the race reached out to him while he was in the hospital in Huntington. Those contacting him were Don Blankenship, Bo Copley, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and Tom Willis. Newbrough said he did not hear from State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.

They live pay day to pay day, go to work and struggle to pay their bills and everything else. I\u2008just think it\u2019s time for somebody who can relate to them in closer manner than just being a politician who goes to D.C. and looks out for their own interest and not the people of West Virginia.\u201d  First and foremost, Newbrough said that his top priority is to take care of the West Virginia veterans and \u201ctake on the VA to get it back where it should be.\u201d He said that he will make sure that the veterans\u2019 healthcare is \u201ctaken care of.\u201d  Secondly, he wants to tackle the opioid epidemic facing West Virginia and the rest of the nation. Newbrough said that West Virginia needs to create more funding for rehabilitation centers and available law enforcement needs to \u201ccrack down on the dealers and pushers who are bringing it into our state.\u201d  \u201cI\u2008don\u2019t think there\u2019s an actual cure for the opioid addiction unless they truly want to come off of it and take care of it themselves, but there has to be some other ways with them talking to more medical professionals who have the experience,\u201d Newbrough said.  \u201cWe need to make sure that funding is there that they can help them with that addiction and can get the help that they need. I\u2019ve been asking around all over and talking to the professionals, but nobody\u2019s able to give me a true answer. I\u2019m not a doctor by no means, but I\u2019m trying to find the answers for them.\u201d  As far as providing the appropriate law enforcement, Newbrough said that through talking with state legislators, he found out that the state will be having a police academy in July for the first time in almost four years. So, Newbrough believes that the state will be able to put more law enforcement out on the roads to control the highways around the statelines to \u201cattack\u201d the problem in that way.  Newbrough said that the current opioid crisis is playing a major role in the current state of the economy.  \u201cEverything right now is focused around the opioid problem in the state, especially with the fact the natural gas is booming and the oil drilling and everything like that, but the people of West Virginia can\u2019t pass a drug screening to get these higher-paying jobs to go to work,\u201d Newbrough said. \u201cSo you have to tackle that problem first.\u201d  Coming from a family of small business owners, Newbrough said he is supportive of small businesses in the state and maintaining that as part of the economy.  In addition, West Virginia\u2019s supply of natural gas will play a huge part in the economy of the state, according to Newbrough.  Newbrough\u2019s campaign has mostly consisted of traveling around the state reaching out to voters on a \u201cpersonal level.\u201d  \u201cAll I\u2008do is go out and travel in my semi,\u201d\u2008Newbrough said. \u201cI\u2019m not spending any money on advertising. I\u2019m not putting any signs up. Basically all I\u2008carry is a business card, and I\u2008feel that resonates with people.\u201d  When asked why the people of West Virginia should vote for him, Newbrough simply said, \u201cBecause I\u2019m just like them.\u201d  \u201cI have no idea where I\u2008stand at the polls. I\u2008can\u2019t afford to do it, but I know that the people reaching out support me by just a handshake,\u201d Newbrough said.  \u201cI take that to heart when somebody shakes your hand and tells you they support you. They actually mean it. I\u2019m just a truck driver and Navy veteran just trying to make a change for West Virginia.\u201d  The primary election for the senate race will be held on May 8.

Aaron Scheinberg, a U.S. military veteran running for a Second Congressional District Seat as a Democrat, said, \u201cMedicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act has enabled 211,000 who didn\u2019t have access to healthcare at all, get healthcare.\u201d  \u201cI will do everything in my power to prevent [a repeal] from happening,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow 211,000 West Virginians to lose their health insurance. We have to fix the cost associated with the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s where I will start. \u201c  Talley Sergent, also running for the Second Congressional District seat as a Democrat, said, \u201cThat\u2019s why we need leaders in West Virginia that understand Medicaid is a lifeline to the 211,000 West Virginians who now have it.  \u201cThis should not be a partisan issue. Unfortunately, it is. If we keep electing the same individuals we are going to get the same results. I will never vote to cut Medicaid. I will only work to protect it, support it and strengthen it.\u201d  Republican Jack Newbrough is running for a U.S. Senate Seat and said the healthcare issue is where he differs from the Democrats who were seated at the table.  \u201cUnder Obamacare, if you are paying $500 a month and you have a $15,000 deductible, that is not health insurance,\u201d he said.  Newbrough said he does not believe Medicaid would be taken away but also doesn\u2019t believe the government needs a bigger role in healthcare.  \u201cAnytime you get the government involved in health insurance, it\u2019s never going to be good,\u201d he said.  Paula Jean Swearengin, running as a Democrat for U.S. Senate,  said she was an advocate for healthcare for all.  \u201cWe live in the wealthiest country in the world; there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t provide the people with healthcare,\u201d she said.  Swearengin said that even people who have health insurance now can\u2019t afford access to healthcare because of the cost.  From healthcare, the forum moved on to economic development.  Scheinberg said, \u201cWe have to diversify. We have to invest in the fasted growing parts of the national economy. We have to have infrastructure.\u201d  He said 30 percent of West Virginia not having access to high speed internet is a problem.  One idea Scheinberg proposed was having a national park in West Virginia that would bring more tourism.  Sergent said, \u201cI think deploying high speed internet is the lynch pin. She proposed a 21st century new deal that involves work force revitalization, education with technical and community colleges and a jobs plan that goes beyond traditional industries.  Newbrough cited a veterans in agriculture program as an example of trying something new.  On the topic of strengthening education, Swearingen said that Medicare for all would fix the PEIA program. She also said that more money was needed to make sure teachers are paid competitively.  \u201cOur children are not going to have a different path in West Virginia if they can\u2019t stay here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to make sure our schools are funded period.\u201d  Newbrough said he had questions about why the teachers and service personnel had organized the work stoppage.  As he learned more, Newbrough said, \u201cI was amazed at how they were really screwing you guys over, to put it bluntly.\u201d  Sergent commented, \u201cAs a product of West Virginia Public Schools, I think public education is a cornerstone to the economy. She said the big concern she has is when she asks teachers what she can do to help they say, \u2018Let me teach. Get rid of these regulations on our teachers. Let them do what they do on their expertise.\u201d  Scheinberg said, \u201cEvery child across West Virginia and across the country should have the best possible education regardless of their zip code.\u201d  He noted that respect for teachers has diminished and teachers are taking home more work on. He said he stood with teachers during the work stoppage and noted they have inspired the country.  Another issue raised was what the candidates would do to address gun violence in the schools.  Sergent said, \u201cI believe in the Second Amendment but as an aunt to children in West Virginia Public Schools, I am terrified for them. We have to make sure we take special interests out of this.\u201d  Newbrough said he was a concealed carry holder and he disagreed with telling someone who is 18 that they can go off to war but can\u2019t purchase certain firearms.  He also said, \u201cWhy is this the gun\u2019s fault?  Scheinberg said his grandfather came to West Virginia because he loved to hunt and he supported the second amendment but noted that bump stocks should be banned and that there needed to be improved background checks.  Swearengin said, \u201cI fully support the Second Amendment but I firmly believe we need commonsense gun measures. You should have to have a license to have a firearm.\u201d We have to do everything we can to protect our children in schools and we have to make sure guns do not go in the wrong hands.\u201d  Saturday\u2019s form was held at the First Presbyterian Church.

While acknowledging the oil and gas industry is helping the local economy, Newbrough said most of those getting work in the field are being brought into the area.  \u201cNobody from this town is doing that job,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all coming from outside.\u201d  Newbrough said he plans to focus his campaign on three specific issues, raising concerns about health care, the need for tax reform and the idea of instituting term limits in Congress. The last one, he said, is important to make certain elected officials do the work with which they are tasked.  \u201cIf they\u2019re not doing their job, they should get fired,\u201d he said. \u201cMe, I don\u2019t want to be there for 30 years.\u201d  Newbrough said reform of the nation\u2019s health care laws is needed, pointing to West Virginia only having one provider participating in the Affordable Care Act exchange.  Immigration also is a big issue for Newbrough, who said he feels increased security on the border is a must, along with better enforcement of immigration regulations.  \u201cI\u2019m all for people coming here to make a better life,\u201d he said. \u201cDo it the legal way.\u201d  Newbrough praised the work of President Donald Trump, saying he plans to run his campaign in a similar fashion.  \u201cI\u2019m a straightforward guy,\u201d Newbrough said. \u201cI say it like it is.\u201d","articles_date":"30 9 2017","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.theintelligencer.net\/news\/top-headlines\/2017\/09\/weirton-resident-seeks-u-s-senate-seat\/","articles_title":"Weirton Resident Seeks U.S. Senate Seat","candidate_fk":6,"first_name":"Jack","id":398,"issue":2,"last_name":"Newbrough","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"She\u2019s a 43-year-old single mom. She\u2019s a Wyoming County native. She\u2019s a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Joe Manchin.  Paula Jean Swearengin is a long shot. She knows that.  But she believes West Virginia deserves better. And she believes she\u2019s got what it takes to turn things around.  \u201cIf we elect the right people, there\u2019s a possibility of change,\u201d she says.  While Manchin is more moderate in his politics, Swearengin considers herself more progressive.  \u201cI hate the dividing labels \u2014 conservative, liberal. I identify as a progressive because I want progress.\u201d  \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  Born in Mullens, Swearengin is the daughter and granddaughter of coal miners.  Before her run for office, she was an accounting clerk for a small business.  \u201cI\u2019m a single, poor, coal miner\u2019s daughter just trying to live day to day.\u201d  But as Swearengin raised her four sons, she saw the opportunities dwindling. She saw companies taking advantage of the state\u2019s people. She saw family members die from occupational and environmental hazards.  \u201cI felt like we had to do something to bring change to our state, to bring the power back to our state. If we don\u2019t, our children aren\u2019t going to have anything here.\u201d  First, she started advocating for clean air, clean water and more jobs. She started lobbying and attending rallies. She\u2019s spoken all over the country, even at the United Nations, trying to bring change to West Virginia.  She decided she wanted to run for office \u2014 to fight from the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 where she believes politicians have been bought out for far too long.  \u201cWhen you see who is funding somebody as a candidate, if Big Pharma is funding their campaign, more than likely, that\u2019s who they\u2019re going to serve.\u201d  She pointed a finger at Manchin, as well as two of the Republican candidates running for the U.S. Senate seat \u2014 Evan Jenkins, currently a U.S. representative, and Patrick Morrisey, currently West Virginia Attorney General.  \u201cThey\u2019re funded by Big Pharma and industry. We deserve clean water, clean air, and for sewage to quit running through our creeks. We have the right to the American Dream and a living wage. But none of that will happen when they\u2019re only serving the wealthiest in the country and state. The working class deserves working class representation.\u201d  She says her campaign has been funded solely by individuals. Her campaign account has a balance of roughly $300,000, and the average donation has been $15.  \u201cThe people have funded my campaign. It\u2019s funded by individuals. When I go to D.C., I owe nobody but the people.\u201d  \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  The issues  Swearengin was a firm supporter of one of the 2016 presidential frontrunners \u2014 Bernie Sanders.  Sanders, too, ran an individual-funded campaign, turning down Super PAC funding and corporate donations. He used social media to help bolster his platform, and became a favorite of millennial voters. The Washington Post reported Sanders won more votes among voters under 30 than Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton combined.  Sanders landed 124,700 votes in West Virginia during the 2016 primary election, or 51.4 percent of the Democratic vote. He won every county in the state.  With a similar platform as Sanders, Swearengin is hoping to garner that same enthusiasm among the state\u2019s Democrats.  \u201cI really admire Bernie Sanders. He actually cares. How many people are going to come from Vermont to McDowell County just to hear what the problems are? A lot of my platform does align with that. He wants to bring progress not only in this state, but this country.\u201d  Swearengin says West Virginia\u2019s main issues are as follows:  \u2022 Opioid epidemic \u2014 She says Big Pharma has influenced politicians for too long. She believes medication-assisted treatment (MAT) has a role to play in addressing the epidemic, and more long-term treatment centers are needed.  \u201cI want to see long-term recovery in every part of West Virginia... We also have to make sure to work on prevention.\u201d  \u2022 Economy and jobs \u2014 She says the Mountain State needs to diversify its economy to survive, with renewable resources and tourism. The gas industry needs to pay its fair share, too.  \u201cI know what it\u2019s like when a family member gets laid off after having a somewhat comfortable life,\u201d Swearengin says. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear difference between being a friend of the coal industry versus being a friend of coal miners.\u201d  She says too many candidates have campaigned on \u201cbringing back coal jobs,\u201d but she says, \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest lie anybody could tell.\u201d  \u2022 Health care \u2014 She believes Medicare should be available for everyone.  \u201cI think we\u2019re behind other countries. We\u2019re not distributing wealth effectively. If you have a healthy, happy workforce, it\u2019s the economic thing to do.\u201d  She says providing Medicare for everyone would help small businesses struggling to pay high premiums for employees.  \u201cWest Virginia is one of the sickest and poorest states in the nation. It would help us greatly with universal health care.\u201d  She also believes fully legalizing cannabis would be beneficial, not only financially and medically, but in terms of the opioid epidemic, too. Studies have shown a decline in opioid addiction in states that have fully legalized marijuana.  \u2022 Environment \u2014 She says she\u2019s tired of seeing the environment polluted by industry, only for West Virginians to be left suffering.  \u201cI worry about my children getting cancer in the southern coalfields,\u201d she says. \u201cYou see a lot of women in West Virginia on the ballot. I think there\u2019s an awakening because of the corruption. As Appalachian women, you don\u2019t mess with our young.\u201d  She would also like to see hemp grown on mountaintop removal sites, to \u201ctransform the barren wastelands\u201d into profit for the state.  \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  Swearengin says for years, politicians have been \u201cfinancially invested in our demise.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s going to take people with a vision for this state \u2014 a vision that isn\u2019t from their funders\u2019 pockets.\u201d  She\u2019s asking West Virginians to make their voices heard May 8 at the ballot.  \u201cI would love to have their vote. This was not my dream. I did not want to go down this path.\u201d  But after seeing years of political corruption and the devastation it\u2019s caused West Virginia, Swearengin says, \u201cI want to be a vessel and a voice for this state.\u201d","articles_date":"7 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.montgomery-herald.com\/news\/who-is-paula-jean-swearengin\/article_07c0858e-5229-11e8-9102-03ef3d3a5b0d.html","articles_title":"Who is Paula Jean Swearengin?","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":399,"issue":8,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"GLEN DALE, W.Va. - Democratic candidate for the United States Senate Paula Jean Swearengin made a campaign stop in the Ohio Valley on Thursday.

She points at trailer homes caked in a fine layer of black soot, blown off the coal trucks that thunder through the area \u2013 \"You see the coal dust on these homes!\" she says \u2013 and stops at a gurgling creek glowing orange. The waste rock of a nearby mountaintop-removal mining site, latent with hazardous elements like selenium, is dumped into valleys, where the toxic chemicals leach into streams. According to a number of studies, the process also increases the rates of lung cancer, kidney disease and birth defects in surrounding communities. \"People are dropping like flies,\" says Swearengin, whose activism has turned into a long-shot bid for the U.S. Senate this year.  Despite America's turn toward natural gas and renewables, 17 percent of U.S. energy still comes from coal, and approximately 12,000 West Virginians work in the industry. Hunks of coal are sold at the airport gift shop in Charleston, and the state's beloved college football team, the West Virginia Mountaineers, touch a piece of coal for good luck before entering their stadium. A popular program called Coal in the Classroom has sent industry representatives into schools to educate \"children about the history and importance of coal.\" \"They've fed us this propaganda that coal miners should be enemies with environmental organizers,\" says Swearengin. \"I am a proud coal miner's daughter, but I'm not going to worship that black rock.\"  It was just more than a year ago that Swearengin, seated on a stage in a high school auditorium in McDowell County, described her state's essential dilemma to Vermont's Sen. Bernie Sanders. \"When the coal industry's gone, we're not going to have anything left,\" she acknowledged, before listing the devastation the industry had caused her personally: \"I've watched my neighbor's children get cancer. I buried my daddy when he was 54 years old. I watched my granddaddy suffocate to death.\" At that point, Swearengin, weeping, reached over to hug Sanders, who consoled her in an embrace. \"We need help,\" she said. It was a central moment, she now says, in her decision to launch a political campaign. \"I see the senator as a public servant,\" she says. \"And I think they've lost touch. They've become immune to people's suffering.\"  \"Coal kills,\" says miner turned activist Chuck Nelson. \"That is what's so criminal about it. Politicians know that and they allow it.\" Her opponent in the May 8th primary, Joe Manchin, West Virginia's sole national-level Democrat, has been in state politics since the time of Reagan, serving as West Virginia's secretary of state and governor. Most recently, in the U.S. Senate, he has taken on the role of the Democrats' token red-state oracle, appearing in national media to decode his state's politics and answer softball questions about Trump country. Although current conventional wisdom holds that the state is red through and through, Manchin remains, according to a poll conducted last summer by West Virginia MetroNews, the state's most popular politician. For Swearengin to confront him, one West Virginia operative recently told Vice, is \"like David versus Goliath, if David didn't have a sling or a rock.\"  Swearengin has tried to tap into a long-simmering populism in West Virginia politics. Much has been made of the fact that Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in every single one of West Virginia's 55 counties, but that doesn't explain another lesson from the 2016 election: Sanders beat Clinton in every single one of West Virginia's 55 counties, too. In February, Lissa Lucas, a backyard chicken farmer and author from Ritchie County, called out legislators on the statehouse floor for letting the oil-and-gas industry write its laws and was dragged away by a pair of security guards \u2013 she is currently running for the state House of Delegates. Weeks later, West Virginia's public-school teachers, who receive among the worst pay in the nation \u2013 about $15,000 less than the national average \u2013 yet must deal with a student population so needy they regularly spend their own money to feed and clothe them, held one of the largest illegal strikes in the history of American education. Teachers walked out of schools in all of West Virginia's 55 counties \u2013 joined by bus drivers, custodians and other public workers \u2013 and rallied for nine days. \"We're not gonna take it!\" the crowd hollered in unison from the lower rotunda at the Capitol in Charleston, imitating the Twisted Sister song.   Paula Jean Swearengin, who faces Sen. Joe Manchin in the Democratic primary, says politicians \"have become immune to people's sufferings.\" This is the segment of the state Swearengin aims to attract with a platform that includes Medicare for all, increased minimum wage, tuition-free state college, legalized marijuana and a major public investment in infrastructure, including alternative energies like wind and solar. \"There is a strong liberal democratic faction that has re-emerged in the state,\" says West Virginia University political historian William Gorby. \"It will be interesting to see what this group does.\"  Manchin, who voted to confirm Trump picks like Jeff Sessions, Neil Gorsuch and Scott Pruitt, and has politely sat down to dinner with the president, is decidedly not a member of the Resistance. A former head of a coal brokerage firm \u2013 a lucrative business interest he maintained even while in the Senate \u2013 Manchin has the backing of the United Mine Workers of America, which represents more than 35,000 current and retired West Virginia miners. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has traveled down to Charleston to speak on Manchin's behalf. He has more than $5 million to spend on the election, having received more than $700,000 from the mining industry since 2009; Swearengin, with an average donation of $15, has raised around $300,000. (Manchin's campaign did not return requests for comment.)  Since declaring her candidacy, Swearengin has relied on little more than social media and a pithy campaign-trail message \u2013 \"We've provided power to America, and now it's time to empower ourselves\" \u2013 to become a star on Twitter, posting frank accounts of her state's tragedies and linking them to Manchin's policies. \"She is a powerhouse,\" says filmmaker Rachel Lears, who is working on a documentary that features Swearengin and three other female candidates. \"Running for Senate is a matter of survival for her.\"  Pretty much the first thing Swearengin tells me is that it's not just a matter of survival for her, but for her entire struggling state. \"The people here are treated like collateral damage,\" she tells me on our drive, somewhere between the coal-dusted homes and selenium-laden creek. West Virginians still \"live in conditions comparable to a Third World country,\" she says. \"And what does that say about America?\"   Two days later, Swearengin introduces me to Chuck Nelson, a retired coal miner she met at a festival to protest mountaintop-removal mining around 2012. Nelson loaded coal in underground mines for nearly 30 years, seven of which were spent employed by Massey Energy, a coal company owned by Don Blankenship. \"The outlaw mining regime,\" as Nelson calls Massey, ripped out safety equipment, including ventilation systems, to boost the pace of production. Nelson has had liver failure and kidney disease, and now has black lung, which occurs as coal dust particles accumulate in the respiratory system. Blankenship, who recently finished a yearlong prison sentence related to a 2010 explosion in one of his mines that killed 29 people, is now running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican.  In the 1990s, mountaintop-removal mining operations were set up on the ridgeline outside Sylvester, the small mining town where Nelson lived most of his life. His wife's asthma worsened. Neighbors died of seemingly rare cancers. The wind blew coal dust from a nearby plant and deposited it in Nelson's home. \"There was coal dust in the refrigerator,\" he says. \"That's how fucking bad it was.\" Now, at 62, he serves as a guide for the next generation of activists. \"Coal kills at each step of the cycle \u2013 the mining, the cleaning, the transportation,\" says Nelson. \"That is what's so criminal about it. Our politicians know that, and they allow it to happen.\"  A coal-preparation plant run by a subsidiary of Massey Energy used to be located a few hundred feet from the nearby Marsh Fork Elementary School. Students found coal dust on their desks, their lockers and wafting through the cafeteria, says Debbie Jarrell, co-director of Coal River Mountain Watch, who for years battled the state to relocate the school. A coal-slurry -impoundment \u2013 which holds 2.8 billion gallons of a sludgelike residual of the coal-preparation process \u2013 sits just up the hill. Family members were so worried about the impoundment breaking over the heads of their children, they often kept kids home when it rained.  Protests erupted during the summer of 2005, as parents and organizers demanded action by the state. Manchin, then the governor, refused to acknowledge the health hazards. An \"extensive investigation revealed no evidence of health risks or regulatory noncompliance,\" read a letter from his office. \"Manchin didn't see the water fountains getting covered with coal dust,\" says Nelson. \"He didn't see the kids getting sick, he didn't see the teachers dying of cancer. He just ignored all that shit!\" (In 2013, a new school opened a few miles away.)   A mountaintio-removal site. Rick Eglinton\/Getty Swearengin and I jump on ATVs to see the Brushy Fork coal-slurry impoundment, the largest in America, holding back roughly 9 billion gallons of toxic waste behind a dam that at over 900 feet is the tallest in the U.S. \u2013 and like the rest of West Virginia's 100-plus coal-slurry impoundments, made of mining waste rock. In 1972, a failure at the nearby Buffalo Creek impoundment sent a 30-foot-high tidal wave of viscous coal slurry through a series of communities, wiping out hundreds of homes and killing 125 people. Jack Spadaro, the former director of the National Mine Health and Safety Academy, who was called into the Buffalo Creek breach as a 23-year-old engineer, tells me Brushy Fork's dam is similarly experiencing \"excessive pore pressure\" that could cause it to fail. The impoundment, he adds, rests atop unstable underground mines. \"It makes me mad,\" says Swearengin. \"This is sitting over people's heads. Just another disaster waiting to happen.\"  Across Appalachia, surface mining has demolished more than 500 mountains \u2013 some 2 million acres of forested hills \u2013 and contaminated 2,000 miles of streams. \"If another country came in here and blew up our mountains and poisoned our water, we'd go to war,\" says Swearengin after our ATV ride brings us to a denuded ridgeline that overlooks the scummy black lake. \"But a company can do it.\"  A few days earlier on Kayford Mountain, an intact peak sandwiched between two massive operations, Swearengin offered an alternative vision for West Virginia's mountaintops. We had ascended to a bluff that looks down into the bowl of the decapitated mountain. Inside, a gray-green plain was strewn with shattered rocks; truck treads were still visible along the paths used by the industry to haul the coal and waste rock. \"This isn't fit for a rattlesnake,\" Swearengin had said. \"But visualize this being a hemp farm, or windmills, or solar farms, something! Instead of just being a desolate moonscape that's left and forgotten.\"  \"If another country came in here and blew up our mountains and poisoned our water, we'd go to war,\" says Swearengin. \"But a company can do it.\"   It may sound starry-eyed, but the state Legislature has already started moving on some of these initiatives. Last year, West Virginia passed a bill allowing licensed residents to grow industrial hemp for commercial purposes, and the state Legislature is in the process of creating an in-state seed-certification program. (In April, bipartisan legislation to facilitate hemp farming was introduced by Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell.) In northern West Virginia, former state Sen. Mike Manypenny showed me around an 11-acre plot of old greenhouses that he is currently retrofitting for hemp production, a crop he aims to sell for its CBD oil, a booming tincture in the health-and-wellness -market. \"I think hemp is going to be the next cash crop of West Virginia,\" says Vinnie Samolis, who is presently working to model a program that could be used on small plots by landowners across the region. \"It would be great for people to have a choice: You can go work in the coal mines or grow hemp.\"  For now, West Virginia remains perilously tied to fossil fuels. The state lost 17,000 jobs between 2012 and 2016, with a significant portion of them related to a downturn in the coal industry, according to a report published by West Virginia University. While the number of jobs in the nation has jumped 83 percent since 1975, the number of jobs in Appalachia has increased by only 50 percent. A 2015 study by the Social Science Research Council reported that in certain Appalachian counties, like McDowell in West Virginia or Martin in Kentucky (a coal county where fetid tap water has recently made national news), over 40 percent of youths ages 16 to 24 are \"disconnected\" \u2013 neither employed nor enrolled in school. \"Some parts of the country,\" the report states, \"are being left behind.\"  At Opportunity House, a drug-treatment center in Buckhannon where Swearengin has occasionally volunteered her time, director Matt Kerner, a former addict himself who is running for the state House of Delegates, introduces me to a roomful of people whom, he says, the state has intentionally neglected: \"Just another example of how around the world, places rich with natural resources end up people-poor. Corporations come in and extract whatever it is they want, and what we're left with is some double-wide trailers and old trucks, which leads to despair and addiction.\"   One snowy afternoon, Swearengin, along with several other West Virginia progressive candidates, makes a campaign stop in the basement of the New Beginning Apostolic Church in Minden, a small town of 250 people in southern West Virginia. Until the early 1980s, the nearby Shaffer Equipment Co., which built electrical substations for the coal-mining industry, used polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in much of its equipment. Banned by the EPA in 1979, PCBs are known to ravage the human body's nervous, immune and reproductive systems, and are especially hazardous to children. In the Minden area, the chemicals often leaked, or were outright dumped, into the creek running through town, burned in open fires, and illegally buried at a number of sites. There's an unmarked dump on the edge of the community filled with PCB-laced transformers and coal sludge \u2013 along with illegal radioactive waste from a nearby hospital. According to Brandon Richardson, the founder of Headwaters Defense, as many as 150 people connected to the community \u2013 more than half the town's population \u2013 have been diagnosed with cancer in the past four years.  The goal of the event is to get Gov. Jim Justice to push forward a recommendation to the EPA that Minden be designated a Superfund Site, which could provide funding to enable residents to be relocated. (Weeks later, Justice released a statement vowing to take action.) \"I can stand on my porch and name 40 people who've died of cancer,\" says Annetta Coffman, a Minden resident who explains that the toxicity of the area is so bad the EPA has asked residents \"not to grow gardens.\" Amy Garrison Ebans, a young mother, recently became sick with breast cancer. \"I was a water bug,\" she says, describing how she swam in the Minden creek as a child, even though her mother had warned her about pollution. \"You don't listen because you're a kid. Now you pay for it.\"  Swearengin has had to develop her own art of political campaigning. \"Early on, I went to a lot of these establishment dinners, rubbing noses with the elite, and I wished I wouldn't have wasted as much time trying to reach people who have probably already made up their minds,\" she says. But in a church room filled with the survivors of an industrial disaster, she seems at home. \"If you don't know, I'm Paula Jean Swearengin, and I'm running for Senate against Joe Manchin,\" she announces. \"And one of the reasons I am is because of struggles like this.\"   Sen. Joe Manchin is trying to remain West Virginia's sole national Democrat in November. Bill Clark\/Roll Call Swearengin grew up in the southern West Virginia coal-mining town of Iroquois, where a dump of coal waste and other hazardous byproducts smoldered in the surrounding hills, sending plumes of toxic smoke, containing sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide, down on her community. \"It burned 24 hours a day,\" she says. She lived in an old coal-company house, with wood siding and a big porch. \"There were a lot of birth defects there,\" she says \u2013 her younger sister was born with a cyst on the base of her brain. Her grandfather, who had worked for decades in an underground coal mine, was diagnosed with black lung, and died in 2001.  Around that time, she and her family settled in Lester, another small mining town, where coal slurry was being injected beneath the community. Her children developed asthma. A disproportionate number of her neighbors had cancer. \"Around my block, I could count eight people,\" says Swearengin. One neighbor's daughter, a 12-year-old girl named Destiny, had a rare form of bone cancer. In calling local officials to see what was behind this unlikely cluster, Swearengin discovered that a little girl in a neighboring town had contracted the same type of cancer. That, she says, \"is when I became active.\"  Between various jobs \u2013 manager of a urologist's office, assistant at a medical-billing company \u2013 she attended rallies against mountaintop-removal mining. At a Kayford Mountain demonstration, she met a charismatic activist named Larry Gibson. \"Larry made me feel like I was a part of something,\" says Swearengin. Just four months before he died of a heart attack in 2012, he shaved Swearengin's head at a protest on the steps of the state Capitol. \"I cried,\" she says. \"I didn't want to give up my hair, but I felt I had to do something radical to get attention.\"  Whether that radical energy can fuel electoral wins in West Virginia is the unanswered question. Progressives in the state Legislature, says Gorby, the political historian, \"are debating issues like the legalization of marijuana, raising the state's minimum wage and stopping the cuts to higher education.\" He also points out that in 2010, activist and former Rep. Ken Hechler, then 95 years old, ran a primary campaign against Manchin to fill the Senate seat vacated by the late Robert Byrd. \"I'm not really running for the Senate,\" Hechler, who died in 2016, told Salon. \"I'm running to enable the people of West Virginia to register at the polls their opposition to [the] devastating practice\" of mountaintop removal. He still managed to pull out 17 percent of the vote.  \"People think we're a bunch of hillbillies,\" says former state Sen. Charlotte Pritt, a longtime advocate for the environment, women's rights and worker safety who beat Manchin in the Democratic primary of the 1996 gubernatorial race. Pointing to the wave of populism that marked the state's 2016 electorate, she says, \"West Virginians were smarter than the rest of the country; they knew what was up in the last election.\" But the general feeling among the state's political observers is that, despite the present progressive energy, Swearengin faces steep odds. \"Politically speaking, this is an extreme long shot,\" popular West Virginia radio host Hoppy Kercheval tells me in January. \"I don't see this mobilized progressive grassroots movement rising up to propel her to upend the giant Joe Manchin.\"  And yet, weeks later, West Virginia teachers from the state's 55 counties stormed the Capitol. Similar strikes broke out in Oklahoma and Kentucky, two other states with economies that rely heavily on fossil fuels, as well as Colorado and Arizona. Katrina Ruff, a teacher in Oklahoma, told The New York Times in April that West Virginians \"gave us the guts to stand up for ourselves.\" At the New Beginning Apostolic Church in Minden, Swearengin's voice is filled with emotion. \"I don't think we should have to sacrifice ourselves for our jobs,\" she says. Her audience is nodding and listening. \"I think we need to unite, to raise the voices of West Virginia. No one should be living like you all are.\"  Afterward, Tim Comer, a 42-year-old mechanic on disability because of ailments he believes could be connected to the contamination, tells me, \"The lady right there seems to be real.\" His father died of lymphoma, and his sister developed cancer as a teenager. \"It seems like she has a heart and cares for the little people, like she is fighting for people like me,\" says Comer. \"She can represent me, she can count on my vote.\"    Blankenship, the coal magnate who spent a year in prison after the death of 29 workers at one of his mines, is competing for the Republican nomination in the primary for U.S. Senate in West Virginia. Spencer Platt\/Getty Recent republican polling shows Blankenship is still competitive in a matchup that also includes Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. A March poll by Axios\/SurveyMonkey showed that an unnamed Republican candidate beats Manchin 52 percent to 43 percent. Republican attack ads have targeted Manchin for, among other things, his superdelegate vote for Clinton. If Manchin beats Swearengin, he will likely face the toughest general election of his career. \"If Manchin loses, he will lose on his record,\" says Selina Vickers, a social worker and former Sanders delegate running for the West Virginia House of Delegates. \"He will lose because of his decision to turn his back on the West Virginia people.\" Charlotte Pritt is firmer: \"Don Blankenship will win the Republican nomination, and unless Paula Jean Swearengin is running, he will win\" the Senate seat.  On the way back to the Charleston area, Swearengin shows me a pipe that drains antimony and arsenic out of an abandoned underground coal mine and into a pond beside the road. \"There are sites like this all over West Virginia,\" she says. \"Nobody knows how many because they haven't been mapped.\" The smell is horrendous. Waste from the pond pours into a creek that enters the Coal River, which many of the communities we have visited rely on for well water. \"Everyone knows it's wrong, but they don't know how to fight back,\" says Swearengin. \"We call it Appalachian Stockholm Syndrome: It feels like we are hostages and there's nothing we can do.\"","articles_date":"30 8 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/politics\/news\/revolt-in-west-virginias-coal-country-w519647","articles_title":"Revolt in West Virginia's Coal Country","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":401,"issue":8,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"President Donald Trump won West Virginia by 42 percentage points in 2016. He\u2019s holding on to high approval ratings in the state and conservatives paint Democrat incumbent U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin as vulnerable. Long known as a moderate Democrat, Manchin has been in West Virginia politics for three decades. With the seat up for grabs this year, the national spotlight has been on the GOP primary -- in which hopefuls are trying to align themselves with Trump.  But this year, the Democratic stalwart in West Virginia politics faces his own primary challenger in progressive Paula Jean Swearengin -- an activist-turned-candidate who says Manchin hasn\u2019t done enough to retain the party nomination.  When the president visited White Sulphur Springs in early April, the stop was billed as a roundtable discussion highlighting the effects of recently passed tax-reform legislation. With GOP Senate hopefuls Evan Jenkins and Patrick Morrisey flanking Trump, the event veered toward attacks on Manchin and his no vote on the tax bill.  \u201cThe Democrats have a problem. I mean, look at your senator. He voted against. Joe -- he voted against. It was bad. I thought he would be helpful,\u201d Trump said at the event.  Overall, though, Manchin has voted with the Trump administration more than 61 percent of the time -- including legislation and nominations, according to Senate records. He says he votes based on the issues themselves and what\u2019s best for West Virginia.  \u201cI say to the people of West Virginia you've hired me. I work for you. I do not work for the president but I want to work with him and I try every day and I will try,\u201d Manchin said in a recent meeting with the media.  That record puts him at odds with the national Democratic Party. Manchin has voted against a majority of Senate Democrats 29.3 percent of the time in the 115th Congress, according to Propublica\u2019s Represent, a web app that tallies congressional voting records. He ranks first among all senators in voting against his party -- with the average Senate Democrat breaking against the majority of the party\u2019s vote 10.1 percent of the time.  He landed in Washington after winning a special election following the death of Robert C. Byrd in 2010. Since then, Manchin has touted himself as willing to work across party lines to compromise.  \u201cI don't look at Republicans as my enemy, I look at them as my friends and my colleagues -- and we're all in this together. You've got to be able to find a pathway for it,\" Manchin said. \"For people to take a hard line on one side or the other -- whether it\u2019s the hard right or the hard left  -- you cannot get anything accomplished.\u201d  But it\u2019s those attempts to reach across the aisle and frequent voting with the Republican majority that is in large part what drew Manchin\u2019s primary challenger into the race.  \u201cHe calls himself a West Virginia Democrat, but I'm not sure if he knows what that means,\u201d said Paula Jean Swearengin, a native of Mullens, West Virginia who identifies as a coal miner\u2019s daughter and coal miner\u2019s granddaughter.  \u201cThe reason to take him on is because he's not adhering to the platform of the Democratic Party and he's not serving the working class,\u201d she said.  After asking Manchin in person for help with the economy in southern West Virginia and to tackle environmental issues like water quality, Swearengin says she felt unheard and overlooked.  She took her pleas to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders when the Vermont politician made a stop last spring in McDowell County for a taping of a town hall on MSNBC\u2019s \u2018All In with Chris Hayes.\u2019  \u201cThe reason that I went to go see Bernie Sanders is because I was begging him for hope. I mean, I've begged for this state for years and I admired him because he was the only senator to sit down with me and talk to me like I was a human being,\u201d Swearengin said.  Swearengin is backed by Brand New Congress, a political action committee established by former staffers and supporters of Sanders\u2019 campaign for president in 2016. The group is aiming to run progressive, working-class candidates around the country in hopes of combatting a political environment they say is dominated by big money.  \u201c[The intent] of this nation was to have a diverse set of people in any and all walk of governments. It wasn't designed to have paid-for, polished politicians to represent us. This nation was built by the people for the people and of the people,\u201d she said.   Many say Swearengin faces an uphill battle to beat Manchin for the Democratic nomination. Beyond name recognition, Manchin\u2019s fundraising efforts have outmatched Swearengin\u2019s by more than 30 to 1. She\u2019s raised nearly $200,000 to Manchin\u2019s $6 million.  Swearengin remains undeterred. Despite identifying as a coal miner\u2019s daughter, she\u2019s hoping to take on the industry that she says has wreaked havoc on where she grew up and still lives.  \u201cThere's no reason as a coal miner's daughter that I should have to beg for something so basic as a clean glass of water. At the same time, we see coal miners that want to just feed their families. And we've heard that propaganda tree hugger versus coal miner. It's even been labeled environmentalist before and that's not it,\u201d Swearengin explained.  \u201cWe we want it all. There's no reason that we can't have basic human rights and, like I said,  we don't even have adequate sewage systems,\u201d she added.  After teachers across West Virginia went on a nine-day strike calling for better pay and benefits, many observers of state politics have wondered if the labor movement -- one that caught fire in other deeply red states -- can translate to a wave of wins for progressives.  But as May 8 nears, Manchin\u2019s campaign is focused more so on November and his potential challenger in the midterm election.  \u201cMy approach is this: I don't pick my opponents. They picked to run and choose to run against me. And whoever that may be, we'll put our records up hopefully and try to get the facts out -- as hard as it is in today's toxic atmosphere,\u201d Manchin said.  Unlike the race for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, state Democrats did not arrange debates between Manchin and Swearengin. West Virginia Democratic Party chairwoman Belinda Biafore said no media outlet ever contacted the organization to organize a statewide debate.","articles_date":"3 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/wvpublic.org\/post\/outmatched-experience-and-funds-swearengin-remains-undeterred-primary-against-manchin#stream\/0","articles_title":"Outmatched in Experience and Funds, Swearengin Remains Undeterred in Primary Against Manchin","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":402,"issue":8,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"Coal baron Don Blankenship, tarred by a mining accident that killed 29 people, is one of the three leading Republican contenders in the West Virginia Senate race \u2014 which is quickly becoming one of the most-watched campaigns of 2018. Washington Republicans are doing their best to stop him and Blankenship is fighting back in a campaign increasingly filled with nasty and personal insults.  Meanwhile, Democratic groups actually appear to be propping up Blankenship by targeting his competitors with a TV ad barrage leading up to the May 8 primary.  Come November, West Virginia will be a top Republican target. It\u2019s become something of a miracle the state still has a statewide Democrat at all, though Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has a long history within the state. But he\u2019s in choppy waters. While it has a working-class Democratic history, West Virginia went for Donald Trump by 42 points and hasn\u2019t gone for a Democrat in the presidential election since 1996.  \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong anti-establishment sentiment in West Virginia, and there\u2019s also an \u2018it can\u2019t get any worse\u2019 sentiment,\u201d Patrick Hickey, a political science professor at West Virginia University, told me. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to shake it up.\u201d  Blankenship is the GOP primary\u2019s wild card. The former Massey Energy CEO has an extensive personal fortune and deep West Virginia ties in the state\u2019s marquee industry. Then again, he also has a criminal conviction, and many voters in the state will never forgive him for the Upper Big Branch mining accident.  The coal boss shook up what had been a two-man Republican primary: Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey have also thrown their hat in the ring.  \u201cOne candidate has no convictions, one candidate has a conviction, and the other guy is a carpetbagger,\u201d Jeff Kessler, a Democratic politician in the state, told me.  The Hill reported that an outside group with links to Washington Republicans is spending $200,000 on TV ads to try to stop Blankenship. But the coal baron is firing back with a bizarrely personal campaign against Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, dragging his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, into the race with odd allegations of Chinese influence \u2014 complete with the use of the word \u201cChinaperson\u201d \u2014 while dubbing the Senate majority leader \u201cCocaine Mitch\u201d in a strange new ad.  Thins have only escalated from there. Blankenship released another ad attacking McConnell\u2019s \u201cChina family\u201d \u2014 while saying he wasn\u2019t being racist because \u201craces are negro, white caucasian, Hispanic, Asian.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump has finally weighed in, urging voters in the state to reject Blankenship and back either of the other two Republican candidates.  At the same time, national Democrats are pouring in their own money to try to bring down Morrisey and Jenkins. Politico reported that the Democratic-allied group Duty and Country was spending nearly $400,000 to savage Jenkins and Morrisey \u2014 but sparing Blankenship. It sure looked like they were elevating the GOP candidate with the biggest vulnerability against Manchin, though they said it was because they believed the other candidates were more likely to be the nominee.  Democrats and Republicans at war ... in a chaotic three person GOP primary campaign. Buckle up.  Don Blankenship and his criminal conviction, explained Blankenship is, in many ways, an only-in-West-Virginia story. He grew up in Mingo County and got his college degree from Marshall University. He rose through the ranks at the Massey coal company, helping build it into one of the largest mining outfits in the country. By 2010, he was making nearly $20 million a year.  But then on April 5, 2010, 29 miners died in an explosion at Massey\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine in southern West Virginia.  Blankenship stepped down soon after, but four years later, federal prosecutors indicted him on conspiring to willfully violate federal mining regulations before the accident and making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission in its aftermath.  The investigation laid bare Blankenship\u2019s cutthroat vision of capitalism. This was a businessman who broke unions, laughed off climate change, despised federal regulations, and described his industry in Darwinian imagery. As I wrote for Talking Points Memo in 2014:  In another handwritten note to the same executive, he called employment of workers tasked with maintaining safety \u201cliterally crazy\u201d and \u201cridiculous,\u201d according to the indictment. The pressure to bring in as much coal as possible at the lowest possible cost was intense.  \u201cIn my opinion, children could run these mines better than you all do,\u201d Blankenship said in another memo. \u201cLook at your cost and figure out what you are going to do to get it down because if we don\u2019t have a better August and September than we had July, you can be assured that the stock options are not going to look very attractive.\u201d  \u201cPlease be reminded that your core job is to make money,\u201d he wrote in yet another memo before the accident, while adding that: \u201cI\u2019m looking to make an example out of somebody and I don\u2019t mean embarrassment.\u201d  Blankenship was eventually convicted of conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards. He always maintained his innocence, even calling himself a political prisoner. But he still served one year behind bars, becoming a free man in May 2017.  And he has a not-insignificant chance of securing the Republican nomination for Senate in West Virginia in two weeks.  The West Virginia Republican Senate primary is a total mess To rehabilitate his image, the Blankenship campaign has been running ads to convince West Virginians that his trial was a politically motivated attack by President Barack Obama.   Blankenship\u2019s entry into the race upended what otherwise might have been a pretty generic contest between Jenkins and Morrisey: the mainstream GOP favorite and the candidate positioning himself as an outsider, respectively.  \u201cHe has deeper ties to the state than Jenkins or Morrisey do,\u201d Hickey said of Blankenship. \u201cHe can say: \u2018I was a Republican in West Virginia before it was cool to be a Republican in West Virginia.\u2019 It\u2019s that authenticity. He has guts. He\u2019s real.\u201d  Blankenship has sought to slime Jenkins, who has represented the southern half of the state in the House since 2015, as an ex-Democrat; Jenkins did indeed switch parties in 2013, though his supporters would remind you that is not an unfamiliar journey in a state like West Virginia.  The coal baron is hitting Morrisey, state attorney general since 2013, for a history of lobbying for drugmakers in a state with the worst opioid crisis in the country, though Morrisey has sued to make data on opioid sales more available while serving as attorney general.  Republicans in Washington, DC, have been worried about Blankenship for a while. The New York Times reported in February that McConnell did not want the former coal boss to be the party\u2019s nominee in the race against Manchin. A new PAC, Mountain Families, with ties to establishment Republicans has attacked Blankenship on the state\u2019s airwaves.  \u201cWho will clean up Washington? Not convicted criminal Don Blankenship,\u201d narration for one of the group\u2019s ads begins.   Blankenship is directing plenty of fire back at McConnell, saying he does not back the long-time Republican leader and dubbing him the \u201cswamp captain.\u201d Then in a radio interview, he called the father of McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine Chao, \u201ca wealthy Chinaperson\u201d and insinuated that the Republican leader was therefore \u201csoft on China.\u201d  In his latest escalation, Blankenship ended an otherwise-normal ad by saying he wanted to \u201cditch Cocaine Mitch,\u201d which Politico noted was an apparent reference to \u201ca 2014 report in the liberal Nation magazine that drugs were once found aboard a shipping vessel\u201d owned by the Chao family.   In an apparent countermove to DC Republicans, national Democrats are backing a group running ads hitting Jenkins for his past entanglements with overcharging health insurers and mocking Morrisey as a carpetbagger.   There hasn\u2019t been a lot of good polling on the race. A February poll commissioned by Jenkins\u2019s campaign showed him on top with 33 percent of the vote; Morrisey was at 25 percent, and Blankenship notched 18 percent of the GOP primary electorate\u2019s support. Then the Hill reported earlier this month that Blankenship was placing either first or second in internal polls of the race.  Most recently, after several weeks in which Blankenship and his attacks on McConnell dominated media coverage, the Weekly Standard reported that two internal polls from the West Virginia campaigns found Blankenship with a slight lead over Jenkins and Morrisey.  Within the state, however, Democrats downplay differences between the Republican candidates. With the GOP\u2019s attacks on health care, a successful teachers strike, and coal likely to dominate the debate during the general election, they don\u2019t see much daylight.  \u201cThey\u2019re all in the same bucket,\u201d a West Virginia Democrat who supports Manchin told me. \u201cThey all want to destroy health care for West Virginians, they\u2019re all against teachers when they\u2019re striking, they\u2019re all against coal miner safety.\u201d  Can Joe Manchin hold on to West Virginia for Senate Democrats? To win back the Senate in November, Democrats need to hold on to 10 Senate seats in states that Trump won. Going by the numbers, none is more challenging than West Virginia.  But Manchin has been elected statewide four times, as secretary of state, governor, and then US senator. His allies will point out that Manchin won reelection with 60 percent of the vote in 2012, the same year that Barack Obama got just 35 percent.  For now, Manchin is treading water with West Virginia voters: Morning Consult pegged him in April with 43 percent approval and 44 percent disapproval. Then again, the Wall Street Journal reported in March that a Republican poll found among GOP primary voters, Manchin was sitting pretty with 60 percent approval.  \u201cManchin is no stranger to running well above the party label here,\u201d the West Virginia Democrat told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing for him to be his own brand, and the brand is still strong.\u201d  Then again, some Democrats in the state think that could be his undoing. Manchin endorsed then-Democrat Jim Justice in the 2016 governor\u2019s race \u2014 and then Justice switched parties after sworn in and became a Republican. In the eyes of some skeptical Democrats, it epitomizes the senator\u2019s problems.  Kessler, who ran for governor in 2016 against Justice, said to watch whether Manchin\u2019s primary opponent, Medicare-for-all-endorsing insurgent Paula Jean Swearengin, registers at all on the Democratic side. Not that she should be expected to win, but if Swearengin has a strong showing, Manchin\u2019s brand of centrism could be in trouble, Kessler argued.  \u201cJoe is gonna have the race of his life, truthfully. Liberal and progressive wings of the party are not enchanted with him,\u201d he said.  Manchin supporters roll their eyes, noting that labor unions like the state AFL-CIO are backing the senator and waving away the idea that Justice\u2019s turncoat act could play a role in the Senate race.  \u201cHe pulled a fast one on everybody. That\u2019s more the perception on the ground. It\u2019s not a Manchin thing; it\u2019s more of a Justice issue,\u201d the Manchin-backing Democrat said, though Hickey told me that some Bernie Sanders supporters in West Virginia have not forgotten that Manchin supported Justice.  One wild card that could work in Manchin\u2019s favor, as even Kessler acknowledges, is the teachers strike that took place in West Virginia this year. The state teachers walked out to demand a pay raise and better health care benefits from the GOP-led state government. Manchin appeared with them on the steps of the state capitol.  It was an unprecedented moment of political activism in the state. It seems at least possible that that energy will translate to anti-Republican votes in the fall.  \u201cThat will be an interesting thing to see,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cThe teachers are extremely annoyed with the Republicans.\u201d  But Manchin will still be fighting against that anti-government sentiment that seems so pervasive in West Virginia these days \u2014 and against Trump, who has put a target on the senator and remains overwhelmingly popular in the state.  \u201cI think Manchin\u2019s in a really tough spot too,\u201d Hickey said. \u201cHe\u2019s a career politician. He\u2019s been around here forever.\u201d  Whatever else, this race will not be boring.","articles_date":"8 5 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/policy-and-politics\/2018\/4\/24\/17261876\/don-blankenship-2018-west-virginia-senate-race-joe-manchin-evan-jenkins-patrick-morrisey","articles_title":"Don Blankenship\u2019s surge in the West Virginia Senate race, explained","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":403,"issue":8,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"Last week, Morning Consult, a research company that conducts online polling, released its 2018 rankings for the most and least popular U.S. Senators. Unfortunately for Senator Joe Manchin, he was the big headline.  \u201cManchin (D-W.Va.) is underwater after posting a 17 point slide\u2014the largest drop of any Senator,\u201d read the headline.  Morning Consult says Manchin\u2019s disapproval rating has skyrocketed from a manageable 27 percent last year to 44 percent in the first quarter, that\u2019s one point below his approval rating of 43 percent in his home state.  Those numbers, if they are accurate, are deeply troubling for Manchin, who is seeking re-election this year.  He\u2019s already in a tough environment as the lone Democrat of the delegation from a state that has rapidly shifted from dark blue to deep red.  But it\u2019s not just that. Manchin is taking a hit\u2026 make that multiple hits.  He has been treated like an oversized political pi\u00f1ata over the last several months.  First, he is a long-time politician running at a time when Washington experience is a negative for many voters. Donald Trump rode the \u201cdrain-the-swamp\u201d mantra to a whopping 69 percent of the vote here in 2016 and many of those voters want to keep the drain pipes open through 2018.  Second, his rival Don Blankenship, who is running for the Republican nomination to Manchin\u2019s seat, started ads against Manchin months ago. \u201cJoe Manchin is a Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama supporter,\u201d says the announcer in one TV commercial.  Clinton lost by 15 points to Bernie Sanders in the West Virginia Primary Election in 2016 and by 42 points to Trump in the general.  Obama was wildly unpopular in West Virginia. He lost by 27 points to Mitt Romney in 2012 and by 13 points to John McCain in 2008.  Third, Blankenship is not alone.  The National Republican Senatorial Committee has also been up on radio for several months attacking Manchin, and a Republican super PAC has run TV ads ripping Manchin for voting against the tax plan.  Fourth, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have specifically targeted Manchin several times.  Pence ripped into Manchin during an appearance at the Greenbrier and continued the attack on Twitter for, among other things, not supporting the tax reform bill.  Trump has also gone after Manchin several times, most recently during a stop in White Sulfur Springs.  Earlier in an interview with the New York Times, Trump said, \u201cI like Joe.  You know, it\u2019s like he\u2019s the great centrist, but he\u2019s really not a centrist and I think the people of West Virginia will see that.\u201d  The national rating agencies all view the Senate race as even or tight.  The Cook Political Report ak nd Inside Elections both have it as a toss-up, while Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball has it leaning Democrat (Manchin does have a primary opponent in Paula Jean Swearengin).  Manchin\u2019s people acknowledge the impact of the attack ads of recent months, but they question whether his disapproval numbers could shoot up 17 points. One observer pointed out that Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) saw his approval rating increase by 17 points.  There is always debate about the legitimacy of poll numbers, but collectively the surveys and the anecdotal evidence reinforce the fact that Manchin is in the race of his political life.","articles_date":"16 4 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/wvmetronews.com\/2018\/04\/16\/survey-shows-increasing-challenge-to-manchins-re-election\/","articles_title":"Survey shows increasing challenge to Manchin\u2019s re-election","candidate_fk":7,"first_name":"Paula Jean","id":404,"issue":8,"last_name":"Swearengin","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"HUNTINGTON -  Democrat incumbent U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin is seeking a second full six-year term in the U.S. Senate against Paula Jean Swearengin in the May 8 Democratic primary in West Virginia.  Manchin, a former governor, first took office after a 2010 special election following the death of U.S. Sen. Robert C. Byrd.  Swearengin says she is a coal miner's daughter and claims she is the only candidate for U.S. Senate in West Virginia who is not a member of the political elite.  They are the only two candidates for the post in the May 8 Democratic primary election, with the winner facing off against the Republican nominee in the November general election.  Here is a look at the two candidates and their views:  Joe Manchin  Manchin, 70, says he is running to create good-paying jobs that allow West Virginians the opportunity to support their families and save for a secure retirement.  \"I want to continue to bring Republicans and Democrats together to find common-sense solutions in the U.S. Senate,\" he said. \"I fought to secure health care benefits for coal miners, and I want to continue fighting to keep the promise of the pensions our miners have earned. I'm running again to protect seniors from Republican cuts to Medicare and Social Security, promote jobs and skills training centers, invest in infrastructure, keep the commitments we've made to our veterans, seniors and children, grow new industries and fight the epidemic of drug addiction.\"  Manchin said he is the only one who can bring both sides together to get something done.  \"You can't build America up if you are too busy tearing each other down,\" he said. \"I listen to West Virginians, and I always do what's best for our state. I've said that Washington sucks, but I'll never give up fighting for West Virginia. For me, it's not about fighting against the other party; it's about fighting for the people I represent.\"  Manchin says the Affordable Care Act needs to be fixed and not totally destroyed.  \"The Republicans have caused premiums to skyrocket and would throw working families to the wolves. I want to put a stop to that,\" he said. \"I stood by our educators, school service personnel and all of the children that deserve a great education in the state.\"  Manchin said he wants to continue to create good-paying jobs.  \"We need new career opportunities that give our people the chance to pay their bills, have decent, affordable health care and a secure retirement,\" he said. \"I'll make sure our seniors don't have to worry about cuts to Medicare or Social Security, and I won't let big corporations walk away from their pension commitments to workers. I'm working to create jobs and skills training centers, make investments in infrastructure and incentives for businesses to hire veterans.\"  Manchin said rural broadband connectivity is possible.  \"I will continue to pass laws to get that accomplished to support jobs,\" he said. \"Broadband is necessary, and the federal government needs to help build this critical infrastructure. It's essential that businesses, entrepreneurs and students are connected to the world and have the tools they need to compete around the globe.\"  Manchin said West Virginia must end the epidemic of drug addiction and keep the workforce drug-free.  \"I will also continue to fight the federal government's overreaching and redundant rules that hamper businesses' ability to succeed,\" he said. \"I want all of our children to get access to a high-quality education. I want our students to have job opportunities when they graduate and the skills to be competitive in the job market.\"  Paula Jean Swearengin  Swearengin, 43, says she is running on a platform of single-payer health care, a $15 minimum wage, free public college tuition and an end to fracking and mountaintop removal mining.  \"I have experienced the best and the worst from being raised as a child of the coalfields,\" she said. \"I understand that coal has been central to my family's income and to the West Virginia economy for most of the last 155 years. The importance of those coal jobs cannot be understated.\"  Swearengin said she has witnessed firsthand the booms and busts of the coal economy.  \"My family was forced to move to North Carolina during one of those busts,\" she said. \"That was the first time in my life that I experienced hunger and homelessness. I have also watched my family, friends and community suffer from the environmental devastation left behind by greedy or unscrupulous coal bosses who use our people, take their profits and leave their coal waste behind.\"  Swearengin said she decided to stand up for the people and became an environmental advocate.  \"I soon learned that the issues run deeper than just the environment and are really about the larger issue of basic humanity,\" she said. \"West Virginians are proud, hardworking people that have given our blood, sweat and tears to power a nation. Yet, despite the riches underneath our feet, we continue to be among the poorest, sickest, least technologically connected and least respected people in the country.\"  Swearengin said she is running for U.S. Senate because a change in the power dynamic is needed.  \"The elites have run this country for too long, whether their names are Manchin, Clinton, Trump, Rockefeller, Bush, Blankenship, Jenkins, Murray or Justice,\" she said. \"It is time to take on this power elite head-on, and I intend to do it.\"  Swearengin said she will take a different approach to the opioid epidemic.  \"You have heard every candidate say they are going to fix this problem, and yet no one has issued a plan other than 'lock them up,'\" she said. \"That changes starting with my first term in office. I have visited with chronic substance users, law enforcement, judges, treatment centers and recovery groups. They all tell me the same thing: 'We can't lock our way up out of this situation.' We have a self-defeating system where legislators get elected from writing get-tough legislation, police officers are under pressure to make more arrests and prosecutors make a name for themselves by demanding maximum sentences - all of this for a problem that we all agree is more of a public health problem than anything else.  \"With the experts, I am in the process of developing a multipronged approach to work with the users in a true public health model that includes treatment, replacement therapy, Narcan on demand, safe injection sites, decriminalization and regulation of narcotics to eliminate deadly substances like fentanyl and long-term recovery options.\"  Swearengin also favors cannabis legalization.  \"I believe cannabis should be legalized for both medical and recreational use as soon as possible,\" she said. \"West Virginia is losing millions of dollars in tax revenue to states that have legalized or are in the process of legalizing marijuana. Again, if it's regulated, we can monitor the distributors and the purity, thereby moving marijuana from the streets to the pharmacies and dispensaries. Marijuana is not going away.

In the speech, he fought back against the politically correct overreach that\u2019s become all too common \u2013 specifically, Democrats in the Virginia Legislature who demonized law-abiding citizens who support \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms\u201d guaranteed by the  Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  A video of Freitas\u2019 floor speech has received 15 million views on his Facebook page, where he said: \u201cFor several days now, some Democrats in the Virginia House of Delegates have made public speeches comparing those of us who take our oath to the Constitution seriously, to include the Second Amendment, to Nazis and segregationists.\u201d  The speech given by Freitas, a former Army Green Beret who served two tours in Iraq, put him on the map virtually overnight in the Virginia U.S. Senate race, where he hopes to win the Republicans nomination to run against Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November.  Freitas\u2019 action is a prime example of the inevitable, growing backlash against the political correctness that increasingly permeates every facet of our lives.  After the tragic shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14 that claimed 17 lives, businesses were attacked and pressured to take a side against the National Rifle Association and its 5 million law-abiding members.  FedEx was the exception \u2013 pledging to keep discounts it offers to NRA members \u2013 but other companies caved to extreme, politically correct demands to take an anti-NRA stance.  Delta Airlines, headquartered in Atlanta, capitulated to the PC pressure, announcing it would no longer offer discounts to NRA members. The backlash was fierce as the Georgia Legislature removed a $40 million tax break for Delta as part of a tax cut package that eventually passed.  So to deny just 13 discounts, Delta flushed a $40 million tax break. Maybe Delta\u2019s shareholders are as PC as its leadership; if not, expect the next shareholder meeting to be very interesting.  Are we really now living in a world where all private businesses are going to be forced to take sides on political hot-button issues?  The obsession with political correctness has invaded the entertainment world as well. As we\u2019ve recently witnessed, the Academy Awards show was completely overrun by PC politics.  Every year it seems we see less entertainment and more political posturing by people paid to entertain us \u2013 not to deliver political lectures. This year, the ratings for the Oscars continued to plunge, down 20 percent from last year.  You would think liberal politicians, PC executives and Hollywood would\u2019ve all gotten the memo by now: America\u2019s backlash against political correctness is one reason why President Trump got elected. But these people don\u2019t deal in facts. They\u2019d rather double down and continue their bully tactics.  Freitas called for an honest dialogue of mutual respect in his speech, yet Democrats walked out. Democratic Delegate Joseph Lindsey said Freitas\u2019 speech offended him more than he\u2019s ever been offended since being elected to the House of Delegates, and Democratic Delegate Lamont Bagby said Freitas\u2019 comments were \u201chateful and divisive.\u201d  Specifically the Democrats were offended when Freitas argued the facts when pushing back against the character assassination of on the left. Freitas said: \"It was not our party that supported slavery, that fought women's suffrage, that rounded up tens of thousands of Asian Americans and put them in concentrations camps, that supported Jim Crow, that supported segregation, or supported mass resistance \u2013 that wasn't our party, that was the Democrat Party.\u201d  The truth hurts.  This is the road of \u201ctolerance,\u201d laced with political correctness and rank hypocrisy, that says we can call you a Nazi and a segregationist but when you throw facts back at us and try to have a respectful dialogue, that road becomes a one-way street.  Freitas spoke passionately about looking beyond gun control as a solution to school shootings. He noted that gun-free zones have not deterred gun violence in schools. In addition, he encouraged long overdue scrutiny into policies enacted by liberals that have led to broken homes.  In this age of politically correct overreach attempting to infiltrate every part of society, it is a breath of fresh air to see an elected leader with the courage to start an honest, respectful dialogue built upon undeniable truths.  Delegate Freitas displayed courage we can only hope to have when he served in Iraq as a soldier defending our country. It\u2019s refreshing to see a leader who won\u2019t be bullied by politicians in a state legislature \u2013 or the U.S. Senate, where we just might see him next year.","articles_date":"16 3 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/2018\/03\/16\/gop-legislator-calls-out-democratic-hate-speech-on-second-amendment.html","articles_title":"A GOP legislator calls out Democratic hate speech on the Second Amendment","candidate_fk":9,"first_name":"Nicholas","id":406,"issue":6,"last_name":"Freitas","newspaper_name":"foxnews","source_fk":2,"state_fk":2},{"article_text":"One of the Republican candidates facing Sen.

That might be expected on a college campus but it should still be encouraging for candidates and Republican Party officials to see so much interest from young voters.  UVA College Republicans Freitas Stewart JacksonAt the same time, however, it should be worrisome for those same candidates and party officials that the audience was overwhelmingly male, demonstrating (anecdotally, at least) that the GOP faces a gender gap as it challenges incumbent Senator Tim Kaine (D-Richmond) in November and as it defends seven of eleven congressional seats against Democratic opponents.  The debate, moderated by Batten School Dean Allan C. Stam, was delightfully civil. Not only were there no catcalls or demonstrations from the audience, the three candidates \u2014 Delegate Nick Freitas, Bishop E.W. Jackson, and Prince William County Board Chairman Corey Stewart \u2014 treated each other and their listeners with respect. There were few instances of snarky comments from any of the participants and, what\u2019s more, the discussion was entirely policy-focused. There were no questions about character, temperament, reputation, or moral shortcomings aimed at one candidate or another.  The three candidates agreed that there should be reform of marijuana laws, with Stewart suggesting that legal medical marijuana is a partial solution to the opioid crisis \u2014 although his primary solution is to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d at the Mexican border to keep out both illegal drugs and illegal immigrants.  All three expressed dismay at the passage of the omnibus spending bill, which was pushed through Congress by Republican leadership and signed into law by a Republican president. Each warned, at one point or another, that the Social Security system is headed toward collapse and that continued deficit spending and accumulation of debt is a national security issue. (They may be unconsciously echoing Libertarian Senate candidate Matt Waters, who has declared this issue as the centerpiece of his campaign.)  Delegate Freitas repeatedly mentioned his military service \u2014 two tours in Iraq, training South Korean special forces \u2014 as well as his experience in the General Assembly as preparation for the U.S. Senate, noting in particular his bill to reform civil asset forfeiture laws, which, he said, had the support of both the Family Foundation and the ACLU.  Bishop Jackson said his experience as a statewide candidate in 2013, when he was the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, prepared him to challenge Tim Kaine. He praised the United States for making it possible for him, the great-grandson of slaves, to run for the United States Senate, and said that participation in the democratic process should not be limited, whether a citizen is black or white, transgender or gay, rich or poor.  For his part, Chairman Stewart stated he was not campaigning to \u201cmake friends,\u201d asserted that anthropogenic climate change is \u201ca hoax,\u201d and called high-school gun control advocate David Hogg a \u201cpunk.\u201d He said that mayors and other public officials who choose not to cooperate in federal immigration-law enforcement efforts should be prosecuted and jailed.

Tim Kaine in November outraised his two GOP primary rivals in the first three months of this year.  Del. Nicholas J. \u201cNick\u201d Freitas (Culpeper), in his third year in Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates, took in $343,712 in the first quarter, according to the most recent reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.  That is more than what Republican contenders Corey A. Stewart and E.W. Jackson, both veterans of past statewide races, took in over the same period.  Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors who narrowly lost last year\u2019s GOP gubernatorial primary to Ed Gillespie, raised $219,952 between January and March. Jackson, a Chesapeake minister who was his party\u2019s nominee for lieutenant governor in 2013, raised $137,078.  Freitas, a former Green Beret who announced his bid in January, also had more cash on hand than his rivals, with $251,694 going into April.  Stewart was the first of the three to jump into the race, and that head start has allowed him to raise more overall. He has brought in $608,662 since he announced his bid in July. Stewart spent $254,721 in the first three months of this year, leaving him $140,502 in the bank.  Jackson had $35,495 in cash on hand.  Stewart\u2019s heavy spending represents a shift in strategy since the gubernatorial primary, when he was considered the underdog. With provocative calls to preserve Confederate monuments and crack down on illegal immigration, Stewart could largely rely on news coverage and not advertising to get his message out in that race.  [Republicans seeking to unseat Kaine embrace Trump at Liberty University debate]  Now, Stewart is widely seen as the front-runner, given how close he came to toppling the better-funded Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who eventually lost the governor\u2019s race to Ralph Northam (D).  Whoever wins the June 12 primary is likely to be massively outspent by Kaine (D), a former governor and his party\u2019s candidate for vice president in 2016.  Kaine has raised $16 million for the race, $2 million of it in the first quarter of 2018. He had more than $10.3 million on hand heading into April, even after spending $959,798 in the first quarter.  Freitas\u2019s donors included N.W. \u201cHap\u201d Chalmers, a retired Dominion Energy employee, and his wife, Rebecca, a Tidewater Community College professor. They each gave $2,700. Travis Brown, a Midlothian, Tex., doctor, gave $2,000.  Stewart\u2019s contributors included L.R. Carr, a stay-at-home mom from Shenandoah County who listed her employer as \u201cMy kids.\u201d She gave $50. On the higher end was Tony Lundy, owner of a Danville company that refurbishes commercial trash bins, and Jongil Kim, a Manassas developer. They gave $1,000 and $2,500, respectively.  Jackson drew considerable support from out-of-state donors, including Lee Roy Mitchell of Dallas, founder of Cinemark theaters, who gave $2,500. Paavo Ensio, a retired Arizona mining executive, gave $2,700. He also received $2,700 from William B. Holtzman, an oil company executive and father of state Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Fauquier), who ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor last year.  Kaine\u2019s donors included Marilyn W. Bos, a Leesburg teacher who gave $250, and John V.

Suddenly, the boy fell to the ground.  Bryan Mackey thought his son had tripped or passed out, and reached to pick him up. \u201cWhen I had him in my hands, I looked at his face and I knew he wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Bryan Mackey told reporters at the time. \u201cI could see it in his eyes, that blank look in his face.\u201d  Brendon had been struck in the head and killed by a random bullet that authorities believe had been fired into the air in celebration. Police have yet to find the person who fired the fatal shot.  Brendon, who was about to start third grade at C. E. Curtis Elementary School in Chester, was one of more than 620 children in Virginia and 26,000 nationwide fatally shot since 1999, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Virginia victims included 80 children age 10 and younger. Three died in gun incidents before reaching their first birthday, a Capital News Service analysis of the data found. Nationally, about 3,000 children 10 and under \u2013 including more than 180 who hadn\u2019t turned 1 \u2013 have been fatally shot since 1999.  The mass shooting that killed 14 students and three teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Valentine\u2019s Day has propelled the debate over gun violence into the national conversation. Students who survived the massacre and their counterparts across the country have declared \u201cNever again\u201d and advocated for gun law reforms.  While mass shootings are relatively rare, gun-related deaths of minors \u2013 age 17 and younger \u2013 are distressingly common. In 2016, the most recent year for which data are available, 39 minors in Virginia and about 1,640 nationwide died as a result of guns.  Accidents like the tragedy involving Brendon Mackey represented 7 percent of all gun-related deaths of minors in Virginia since 1999. Thirty-seven percent of the deaths were suicides, and 53 percent were assaults. The remaining deaths were undetermined.  \u201cOur kids have become collateral damage for the unacceptable policies of the gun lobbies,\u201d said Lori Haas, Virginia director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.  Haas became involved with the issue after her daughter Emily, 19, was shot and injured in the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, when a gunman killed 32 people. When it comes to gun deaths of minors, Haas said, \u201cEven one is too many.\u201d  The statistics on gun-related deaths  Nationally, of every 100,000 Americans age 17 and under, two are killed by gunfire each year, according to the CDC data. In Virginia, the rate is 1.9 gun-related deaths per 100,000 minors. The highest rates in the nation are 9 deaths per 100,000 minors in the District of Columbia, 5.5 in Alaska and 4.1 in Louisiana.  The data showed a distinction between younger children and older ones. Since 1999 in Virginia:  139 children age 13 and under were fatally shot. About 66 percent of those deaths were classified as assaults, 20 percent as accidents and 11 percent as suicides. 482 Virginians between 14 and 17 died from gunfire. Almost half of the deaths \u2013 49 percent \u2013 were assaults, 44 percent were suicides and nearly 3 percent were accidents. Those numbers show that suicide is more prevalent among older children than younger ones \u2013 a fact underscored by the Virginia Violent Death Reporting System. That system found that Virginians age 15 to 19 were seven times more likely to commit suicide than those age 10-14.  The CDC data show that 44 percent of minors killed by guns in Virginia were African-American. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 20 percent of Virginians are African-American. This indicates that black children are fatally shot at a disproportionately high rate in the state.  The debate over gun control  In March, thousands of Virginians participated in the international March for Our Lives, protesting government inaction on gun control legislation. About 5,000 people, including students and politicians, marched on the state Capitol. The protests came after a legislative session in which members of the General Assembly clashed over dozens of bills involving gun regulation.  Lawmakers proposed more than 70 gun-related bills. Some sought to restrict access to guns, including by children. Others sought to expand gun rights, including letting people bring guns to church. In the end, only two of the bills passed. Both have been signed into law by Gov. Ralph Northam:  House Bill 287, introduced by Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, will create a specialty license plate with the message \u201cStop Gun Violence.\u201d Senate Bill 669, sponsored by Sen. R. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, seeks to keep guns out of the hands of Virginians age 14 or older who have been ordered to get mental health treatment. Under this law, which took effect immediately on April 18, such individuals face restrictions on purchasing, owning and transporting firearms. SB 669 was meant to address what Haas and other gun control proponents call \u201cvictims of access.\u201d This is the idea that even when children are involved in gun-related accidents or deaths, they are victims of negligence by people who allowed them access to the weapons.  Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, tried to address that issue by introducing a measure making it a Class 1 misdemeanor to knowingly give a child of 4 or younger access to firearms.  Lopez said he was motivated to sponsor House Bill 950 by the manyincidents in which children in the state accidentally end up shooting themselves orothers.  \u201cRegardless of what you think about the Second Amendment, I think we can all agree that the Founding Fathers were not talking about 2- and 3-year-olds,\u201d Lopez said.  HB 950 died in the House Militia, Police and Public Safety Committee.  Republican opposition to such legislation has largely centered on concerns over Second Amendment rights. Del. Nicholas Freitas, R-Culpeper, was one of the most vocal opponents of gun control legislation in the 2018 session.  When the debate was coming to a head in the General Assembly in March, after the Florida shooting, Freitas gave a speech defending his party\u2019s position in the gun debate. Freitas said the ultimate goal of gun control legislation from Democrats was to \u201cgut the Second Amendment.\u201d  \u201cWhen the policies fail to produce the results you are promising your constituents, you\u2019ll be back with more reasons to infringe on Second Amendment rights,\u201d Freitas told Democrats in the House.  But during the legislative session after Brendon Mackey\u2019s death, the General Assembly was moved to action. In 2014, lawmakers passed a pair of bills making it a felony to injure someone through the reckless use of firearms.  \u201cAny person who handles any firearm in a manner so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life and causes the serious bodily injury of another person resulting in permanent and significant physical impairment is guilty of a Class 6 felony,\u201d the legislation stated.  The bills were aimed at preventing accidents as a result of celebratory gunfire. Supporters dubbed the legislation \u201cBrendon\u2019s Law.\u201d","articles_date":"6 5 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.insidenova.com\/news\/politics\/dozens-of-children-fatally-shot-in-virginia-each-year\/article_7fdfee30-511e-11e8-9050-4b5d36ef1019.html","articles_title":"Dozens of children fatally shot in Virginia each year","candidate_fk":9,"first_name":"Nicholas","id":411,"issue":3,"last_name":"Freitas","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2},{"article_text":"Del.

Lou Dobbs called it \u201cbrilliant,\u201d tweeting, \u201cWatch this!\u201d  The speech helped Freitas, a little-known lawmaker, to present himself as a credible alternative to Corey R. Stewart in the primary contest to field a GOP challenger to Sen. Tim Kaine (D) in November.   Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William, becomes emotional as he begins a floor speech criticizing a speech by Del. Nicholas J. Freitas, R-Culpeper during the session of the Virginia House of Delegates. Torian was joined by other members of the black caucus in objecting to the Republican's floor speech on gun control, abortion and slavery. (Bob Brown\/AP) Stewart\u2019s 12 years as chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors and two statewide campaigns, including his near-win in the gubernatorial primary last year, make him the most widely known of six Republicans seeking the Senate nod.  But he\u2019s also a bomb thrower who waves the Confederate flag, demonizes undocumented immigrants and recently said he felt bad for the wives of \u201cflaccid\u201d fellow Republicans in the General Assembly.  Stewart\u2019s approach unnerves Republicans who haven\u2019t won a statewide race since 2009 and watched their party take a shellacking at the polls in 2017, in a massive backlash to President Trump.  While very conservative in his own right, Freitas, 38, could be the fresh-faced antidote to all that, they say.  \u201cIt\u2019s rare that you have somebody with the characteristics that Nick has,\u201d said Morton Blackwell, Virginia\u2019s representative on the Republican National Committee. \u201cHe\u2019s an extraordinarily dynamic person. The news that there have been millions and millions of people viewing that speech of his is very good news. I had seen it and liked it but, wow, that\u2019s great.\u201d  Blackwell, who backed Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie last year and Stewart in his unsuccessful 2013 bid for lieutenant governor, said he wished Stewart had been more supportive of Gillespie after he beat Stewart for the GOP nomination for governor.  \u201cA lot of people have high name identification,\u201d he said, without naming Stewart. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people are going to vote for them. I would say there\u2019s a pretty good correlation between the people who know Nick Freitas and the people who are going to vote for him. That can\u2019t be said in every election.\u201d  Besides Blackwell, Freitas has the endorsements of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and former governor Robert F. McDonnell.  Stewart, who has been praised by populist heroes Stephen K. Bannon and Laura Ingraham, isn\u2019t interested in endorsements from establishment politicians.  \u201c[Freitas] is not going to be able to rally Trump voters,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThere are a lot of conservatives out there who want a fighter, who want somebody who\u2019s going to support the president.\u201d  Freitas now backs Trump, but in deleted social media posts from 2015 and 2016, Freitas referred to him as a \u201c5 time draft deferring \u2018tough guy\u2019\u2009\u201d who would \u201ctake some candy from a small child .\u2009.\u2009. or maybe kick a kitten\u201d and said Trump is not the candidate for \u201cliberty minded conservatives.\u201d  John Fredericks, host of a popular conservative radio show who was co-chair of Trump\u2019s Virginia campaign after Stewart was fired from the post, said Freitas has a shot, but Stewart is the favorite. Anyone who runs against him has to be as aggressive as he is, Fredericks said.  \u201cThe thing is, if you don\u2019t respond to Corey he\u2019s going to blow your head off,\u201d he said. \u201cCorey plays to win. He goes to a slingshot fight and he brings a bazooka.\u201d  When he announced his campaign, Freitas pledged not to attack his GOP competitors, but three months later, he says he won\u2019t let personal attacks go unanswered.  He raised concerns that Stewart staff members and volunteers in comments online poked fun at his last name, which is Portuguese, and misrepresented his positions.  \u201cIf Corey decides he wants to make the main thrust of his campaign to attack me,\u201d he said, without suggesting that will happen, \u201cI\u2019m going to defend myself. I think it would be very unwise for Corey to try to come after me.\u201d  Freitas, who is in his second term in the House of Delegates representing a rural Piedmont district, enlisted in the Army after high school, rose to the Special Forces and served two combat tours in Iraq.  \u201cHe went full mission and said if I\u2019m going to execute the mission you need to know where I stand and I\u2019m not going to be pushed around,\u201d said Denver Riggleman, a Republican distillery owner who briefly ran for governor last year and has endorsed Freitas.  In his seven-minute screed, Freitas said he tried to convey how Democrats who compare gun-rights advocates to Nazis or segregationists shut down any chance for a real debate.  \u201cIt was not our party that supported slavery, that fought women\u2019s suffrage, that rounded up tens of thousands of Asian Americans and put them in concentration camps, that supported Jim Crow, that supported segregation or supported mass resistance. That wasn\u2019t our party,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the Democrat Party.\u201d  He also suggested that deterioration of the nuclear family created conditions for violence to flourish. It didn\u2019t quite come out that way.  Citing a Brookings Institution study, he said, \u201cvarious cultural changes that happened in the \u201960s to include the abortion industry,\u201d contributed to more out-of-wedlock-births and broken families.  \u201cI\u2019m not blaming single mothers,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI grew up with a single mother. But I do think it\u2019s important for us to take a look at all of the different factors that have gone into an increase of violence.\u201d  Freitas\u2019s remarks visibly upset several Democrats, many of them African American, and they walked off the House floor in protest.  While Republicans applauded the speech, some said Freitas could have better framed his argument.  \u201cNick was trying to make a very passionate speech about a right that many people hold dear and other people took away from it what they did based on their own experiences,\u201d said House Majority Leader C. Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah), who endorsed him. \u201cIf we can learn anything from this, I think it\u2019s that everybody views the world differently.\u201d  The point was made Thursday in Richmond when the tongue-in-cheek \u201cSensitivity Caucus\u201d distributed dubious honors to lawmakers.  For Freitas\u2019s abrasive speech, only one type of award would do: \u201ccoarse sandpaper.\u201d","articles_date":"9 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/virginia-politics\/a-state-lawmaker-gives-corey-stewart-competition-for-gop-senate-nomination\/2018\/03\/09\/4be56714-222e-11e8-86f6-54bfff693d2b_story.html?utm_term=.048274918dc4","articles_title":"A state lawmaker gives Corey Stewart competition for GOP Senate nomination","candidate_fk":9,"first_name":"Nicholas","id":412,"issue":8,"last_name":"Freitas","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2},{"article_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Virginia Republican Del. Nick Freitas, one of the contenders to unseat U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, has gotten more than 10 million views for his speech on the floor earlier this month. One expert says that helped his chances of getting the Republican nomination, but when it comes to the general election, he\u2019s not so sure.  On March 2, Freitas, R-Culpeper, rose to address recent criticisms of the Republican Party for its long-standing resistance to gun control, particularly after the Florida school shooting. He said that \u201cthe welfare state contributed significantly to dismantling the family,\u201d leading to the broken homes that he claimed many mass shooters come from, and cited \u201cthe abortion industry\u201d as one of \u201cvarious cultural changes [from] the Sixties\u201d that contributed to the problem.  He also claimed that a recently defeated ban on bump stocks failed because no Republicans believe that gun-control efforts would stop there, and said of the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II, resistance to women\u2019s suffrage, segregation and Jim Crow, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t our party. That was the Democrat[ic] party.\u201d  The speech got Freitas national-TV recognition and support from conservative personalities such as Lou Dobbs. And Mark Rozell, a professor of public policy at George Mason University, said that it improved his political prospects.  Calling Freitas an \u201cobscure legislator\u201d who won election narrowly, Rozell said, \u201cIn one speech he propelled himself into substantially higher name recognition.\u201d  Until that speech, Rozell said, Freitas was the choice of moderate Republicans in the field to unseat Kaine \u2014 \u201can alternative to Corey Stewart and E.W. Jackson, two fiery populists who appeal to the far-right wing of the Republican Party.\u201d  Now Freitas is in the same category, Rozell said.  \u201cReady to dust it up in the rhetoric \u2026 in order to get attention for himself, which he\u2019s done fantastically.\u201d  That helps his chance of getting the nomination, Rozell said, adding Stewart \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a real chance\u201d after his previous defeats, and Jackson was \u201cdefeated handily\u201d in his last couple of runs.  \u2018Where the votes are\u2019 Rozell added that he didn\u2019t think there was a great deal of difference between Freitas and Stewart on policy, though he considered Freitas a bit more libertarian.  But the abortion comments, particularly, were directed toward religious and social conservatives, \u201cwho have a substantial impact on who get the nomination\u201d in the Republican Party, Rozell said. In a low-turnout primary, \u201cIt\u2019s the hard-core conservatives who are going to show up, and show up in big numbers. That\u2019s where the votes are.\u201d  Even so, Rozell said, any run against Kaine is \u201ca real long shot,\u201d Rozell said. The incumbent is \u201cfairly popular,\u201d with all the advantages of the office \u2014 name recognition, fundraising and a \u201cfairly credible\u201d record. Not to mention what Rozell called \u201cthe blue trending of Virginia.\u201d No Republican has won a statewide race since 2009.  \u201cI think many Republicans actually wish that some other big-name Republican \u2026 would step forward,\u201d Rozell said, adding gossip has centered around former presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and others, \u201cbut that just has not materialized.\u201d","articles_date":"12 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/wtop.com\/virginia\/2018\/03\/va-del-freitas-speech-drew-attention-votes\/","articles_title":"Va.

Del. Nick Freitas (R-Culpeper) set off the reaction with remarks that began by defending Republican resistance to gun-control measures in the wake of the Florida school shooting, but wound up blaming \u201cthe abortion industry\u201d for fostering a broken society and castigating the Democratic Party for segregation and the Japanese internment camps of World War II.  He was responding to recent criticism that Republicans have blood on their hands for failing to act on gun violence. \u201cI would really appreciate it if every time you want to make a powerful point, you don\u2019t project the sins, the atrocities and the injustices that the Democratic Party perpetrated onto others onto us,\u201d said Freitas, who is running for the Republican nomination to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine this year. Four others are seeking the GOP nomination, including Corey Stewart, the chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, who equates gun control with castration and is holding campaign events at gun ranges.  [On the same day, Tim Kaine meets with mothers about gun control while Corey Stewart visits shooting range]  After Democrats settled down, Del. Joseph Lindsey (D-Norfolk) told the House that \u201ctoday, I have been offended as I can never recall since being a part of this body. And I have seen many of my colleagues emotionally shaken and bothered by either a lack of concern for facts or just simply playing to the cameras, I don\u2019t know which.\u201d  The gun issue has bubbled beneath the surface of a legislative session otherwise marked by self-conscious bipartisan cooperation. The Republican leadership of the House killed dozens of gun-control bills introduced by Democrats, including measures to expand background checks, ban the \u201cbump stocks\u201d that increase firing rates and enabling families to have weapons confiscated from dangerous loved ones.  [Bipartisanship in Virginia does not extend to gun legislation]  The issue had faded to the background behind high-profile, bipartisan efforts to expand Medicaid, pass utility regulation and approve bills to restructure criminal justice. But since the Valentine\u2019s Day shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 people dead, Democrats have tried to draw more attention to guns.  Several have made floor speeches, and on Thursday House Democrats called on Republicans to revive some of the bills that never made it out of committees.  But it took a sleepy Friday session, with high winds whipping outside the Capitol and delegates eager to wrap up early and head to their home districts, for the tension to finally erupt.  Freitas took the floor of the House during a time set aside for members to make remarks on any topic. He started calmly, arguing that facts and data should be part of the debate about how to prevent gun violence.  Many of the perpetrators of recent mass shootings have come from broken homes, he said. Studies show that the breakdown in families \u201ccan be attributed to various cultural changes [from] the Sixties to include the abortion industry,\u201d Freitas said, to groans from Democrats. \u201cThe welfare state contributed significantly to dismantling the family,\u201d he continued.  Freitas defended the Second Amendment and decried government efforts to stop people from defending themselves. Democrats really only see one solution to societal violence, he said: \u201ctearing apart or gutting the Second Amendment\u201d and banning all guns.  Why do Republicans resist debating a ban on bump stocks? \u201cBecause quite frankly, I don\u2019t think any of us on this side of the aisle believe you when you say that\u2019s all you want to do,\u201d Freitas said.  Instead, Democrats just want to demonize their opponents, \u201ccomparing members on this side of the aisle to Nazis,\u201d he said, referring to an email Del. Mark Levine (D-Alexandria) sent out to supporters last month that slammed Republicans for supporting assault weapons similar to those \u201ccreated by Nazi Germany.\u201d  Freitas criticized a letter from a 24-year-old teacher, which Del. Dawn Adams (D-Richmond) read a few days ago, in which the teacher said she worried that politicians were debating between the Second Amendment and her life. And Freitas was especially upset, he said, by a recent comment from Del. Ken Plum (D-Fairfax) comparing the gun rights issue to segregation.  \u201cI just want to remind everyone of something very quickly. It was not our party that supported slavery, that fought women\u2019s suffrage, that rounded up tens of thousands of Asian Americans and put them in concentration camps, that supported Jim Crow, that supported segregation or supported mass resistance. That wasn\u2019t our party. That was the Democrat party,\u201d he said.  At this point large numbers of Democrats, including most of the Black Caucus, got up and left the chamber. Even a few Republicans slipped out.  Freitas said that if Democrats want to have an honest debate on gun issues, it should \u201cstart with a certain degree of mutual respect.\u201d They shouldn\u2019t assume he has been bought off by the NRA, he said, and he wouldn\u2019t assume Democrats were paid off by Planned Parenthood.  After seven minutes, he finished to applause from many Republicans, and most of the Democrats came back into the chamber.  But after another Republican, Del. Thomas Wright Jr. (R-Lunenberg), who chairs the subcommittee that shelved most gun-control bills, stood and blamed gun violence on school systems that stopped teaching about God, Democrats began leaving the chamber again.  Del. David Toscano (D-Charlottesville), the House minority leader, asked for a recess.  A few Republicans, including Del. Greg Habeeb (R-Salem), huddled with several Democrats to try to smooth things over. But Del. Lamont Bagby (D-Henrico), who heads the Legislative Black Caucus, was steamed.  It\u2019s one thing to make a political point about the NRA and Planned Parenthood, he told Habeeb, but suggesting that it was Republicans who were \u201cfreeing my people? I mean, come on.\u201d  When they returned from a 15-minute recess, the Democrats had Lindsey \u2014 who is African American and seldom speaks on the House floor \u2014 make a few remarks to express their unhappiness and call for civility.  The calm only lasted a moment, though.  Del. Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah), the House majority leader, stood for remarks of his own. He first thanked Lindsey, but quickly worked himself into a lather over guns. \u201cWe have sat here for a week and listened to the other side of the aisle accuse us in every different way that they can .\u2009.\u2009. of being complicit with Nazis and terrorists and al-Qaeda,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes we can only take about so much of that.\u201d  As Gilbert grew more agitated, at one point saying the idea of holding criminals accountable is not \u201cin high favor\u201d among Democrats anymore, Toscano began interrupting with protests to Speaker M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights).  Cox warned Gilbert that he had only two minutes more to speak. \u201cEveryone take a deep breath,\u201d Cox said.  During the hubbub, Adams, the Democrat who had spoken a few days ago about the 24-year-old teacher who was distraught over guns, made her way over to Freitas\u2019s desk and spoke with him.  \u201cI just wanted to figure out what was going on with him. That\u2019s all,\u201d she said later. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to finish our conversation.\u201d","articles_date":"2 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/virginia-politics\/gun-control-issue-boils-over-in-virginia-house-after-fiery-speech-from-delegate\/2018\/03\/02\/991938d4-1e42-11e8-ae5a-16e60e4605f3_story.html?utm_term=.2e858199d921","articles_title":"Gun-control issue boils over in Virginia House after fiery speech from delegate","candidate_fk":9,"first_name":"Nicholas","id":414,"issue":3,"last_name":"Freitas","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2},{"article_text":"HOT SPRINGS, Va. \u2014 Under a banner declaring \u201cLiberty Rising\u201d at a gathering of Virginia Republicans, Del. Nick Freitas (R-Culpeper) announced late Friday that he will seek his party\u2019s nomination to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine (D) next year.  Freitas will compete for the nomination against Corey Stewart, the bombastic chair of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors who has fashioned himself after President Trump.  [After near miss in primary for governor, Stewart promises a \u201cvicious\u201d campaign against Ka ine]  The move is likely to reassure some state and national Republican leaders who have been nervous about Stewart becoming the face of the party in a purple state where Trump is deeply unpopular.  [Anybody but Corey Stewart? GOP leaders search for an alternative]  Stewart narrowly lost the primary for governor in June after pledging to crack down on illegal immigration and preserve Confederate heritage.  But Freitas, who was just elected to a second term last month, is not exactly a mainstream figure. At his announcement in a cramped hotel suite at the Homestead resort, the 38-year-old federal contractor delivered a treatise on small government, promising to combat a worldview that \u201ctreats free people as if we were subjects instead of citizens.\u201d  \u201cQuite frankly, establishment elements from both sides of the aisle have been responsible in thinking themselves made from finer clay than the rest of humanity,\u201d Freitas said.  In response to his announcement, Virginia Democratic Party Chairwoman Susan Swecker lumped Freitas and Stewart together and called the state GOP out of touch.  \u201cThis extremist duo of candidates in the race supports Donald Trump\u2019s dangerous plans, and neither of them would put Virginia families before their nutty agenda,\u201d she said in a statement.  With a conservative voting record and libertarian streak, Freitas expected to line up support from Republicans hoping to rebrand the party with a fresh face. He has sought advice from Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Mike Lee (Utah) and members of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus.  Others are waiting to see how the field shapes up. Evangelical pastor E.W. Jackson is preparing to announce, former governor James S. Gilmore III is considering it, Army veteran Ivan Raiklin filed the paperwork, and policy expert John Norton Moore may run.  Kaine \u2014 a popular and well-funded former mayor, lieutenant governor and governor \u2014 is seeking a second term after delivering Virginia for Democrats as Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice-presidential running mate in 2016.  Freitas said he wouldn\u2019t \u201csugarcoat\u201d the challenge ahead but dismissed critics who warned him the race would damage his political career, saying that wasn\u2019t his priority.  He also pledged not to attack his GOP competitors, a refreshing concept to some Republicans weary after the nasty gubernatorial primary between Stewart and Ed Gillespie.  \u201cI\u2019m not here to bash my fellow Republicans,\u201d Freitas said. \u201cPeriod. The end.\u201d  Raised in California by a single mother who ran a GOP women\u2019s group, Freitas, 38, joined the Army after high school, became a Green Beret and served 11 years active duty.  In the House of Delegates, he is known for giving passionate floor speeches, such as his 2016 defense of Sgt. 1st Class Charles Martland, who was facing discharge for beating up an Afghan commander who allegedly raped a small boy.  He is a member of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association.","articles_date":"9 12 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/virginia-politics\/del-nick-freitas-jumps-into-gop-field-to-challenge-sen-tim-kaine-in-2018\/2017\/12\/09\/af6f240a-dc6a-11e7-b859-fb0995360725_story.html?utm_term=.f12d4069b711","articles_title":"Del.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., next year, according to GOP insiders.  The new contender would be Del. Nicholas J. Freitas, R-Culpeper, an Iraq combat veteran first elected to the General Assembly in 2015 and easily re-elected this year. Freitas would join Corey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, in seeking the GOP nomination.  Freitas supporters in a Facebook group called Draft Nick Freitas for U.S. Senate have been calling on him to run.  Freitas did not return a phone call, but said two weeks ago in an interview on the John Fredericks radio talk show that he would soon announce a decision on whether to run.  Republicans will gather at The Omni Homestead Resort in Hot Springs the weekend of Dec. 8 for their annual Advance, a weekend of speeches, hobnobbing and politicking. Candidates for office often host hospitality suites.  \u201cI hope to see you all at the Advance,\u201d Freitas wrote Nov. 16 in the Draft Freitas Facebook group, ending his post with a winky face emoticon.  Should Freitas announce, he will face a bombastic primary opponent in Stewart, who was a chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in Virginia and has pledged to run a \u201cvicious and ruthless\u201d campaign against Kaine. In a June primary, Stewart narrowly lost the GOP nomination for governor to Ed Gillespie, who then lost the general election to Democrat Ralph Northam.  Stewart centered his gubernatorial campaign on protecting Confederate monuments while attacking Gillespie as an establishment figure, and appeared at an event in February in Charlottesville with Jason Kessler, the man who coordinated the August \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally there that turned deadly.  In October, Stewart mocked transgender House of Delegates candidate Danica Roem over her gender identity. Roem, who is from Stewart\u2019s county, won her race and will join the legislature in January.  Martha Boneta, a GOP activist from Fauquier County, said Freitas is respected by Republicans across the state.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult to attack Nick Freitas. He\u2019s a combat veteran. He would have given his life for this country in combat and he has a great love for his country. He\u2019s the new face of the Republican Party,\u201d said Boneta, who said she is not yet making an endorsement.  \u201cNobody can deny that Corey Stewart is masterful at his ability to use social media \u2014 I should say use media, in general \u2014 by throwing flames. He does have a strong base. At the end of the day, people need to ask themselves who is best to lead Virginia in these unique times that we\u2019re in. And it has to be somebody who\u2019s a fighter and who\u2019s always going to put the constituency, the public, before their own interests.\u201d  Fredericks asked Freitas on the radio show how he\u2019d handle attacks from Stewart.  \u201cHe\u2019s going to paint you as establishment,\u201d said Fredericks, who worked with Stewart on the Trump Virginia campaign before Stewart was fired from the position and remained on as a volunteer. \u201cHe\u2019s going to paint you as basically a Republican Party of Virginia tool of the elected officials and you\u2019re going to have to run into the Corey Stewart chainsaw. Why would you put yourself through that?\u201d  Freitas said he would be running against Kaine, not Stewart.  \u201cI\u2019m not getting into this with the concern of what Corey\u2019s going to say or what Corey\u2019s going to do,\u201d Freitas said. \u201cI\u2019m going to let Corey run his race and I\u2019m going to run mine, if I decide to run.\u201d  Freitas added: \u201cTrying to paint me as establishment is about as ridiculous as you possibly could go. I\u2019ve been in the General Assembly two years. Take a look at my voting record. Take a look at my stances.\u201d  E.W. Jackson of Chesapeake, a minister who was the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor in 2013, also plans to run as a Republican candidate in next year\u2019s Senate primary, according to a spokesman. Jackson is a social conservative who lost the 2013 race to Democrat Ralph Northam.  The Republican Party of Virginia\u2019s central committee has opted for a primary next year to nominate a candidate to challenge Kaine, who is seeking a second term.  \u201cTim Kaine\u2019s definitely going to have a robust challenger next year,\u201d said John Findlay, the party\u2019s executive director.

Noting that Democrats recently compared Republicans to Nazis, terrorists and \u201csegregationists\u201d while attacking the GOP for being pro-gun, Freitas said Democrats shouldn\u2019t project their own \u201csins\u201d onto their opponents.  \u201cIt was not our party that supported slavery, that fought women\u2019s suffrage, that rounded up tens of thousands of Asian-Americans and put \u2019em in concentration camps, that supported Jim Crow, that supported segregation, or supported Massive Resistance,\u201d Freitas said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t our party. That was the Democrat party.\u201d  Coming on a Friday expected to be uneventful and short, the ruckus cast a sour mood over the House as lawmakers headed home before the final week of the session.  Saying many mass shooters come from \u201cbroken homes,\u201d Freitas ticked off a series of reports and statistics and suggested abortion, \u201cthe welfare state\u201d and other cultural shifts that began in the 1960s have weakened families.  If Republicans can be accused of being in the pocket of the National Rifle Association, Freitas said, the same can be said of Democrats and the groups that support them.  \u201cWhen I get up here and I talk about abortion, I don\u2019t assume that you\u2019re all bought and paid for by Planned Parenthood. I don\u2019t assume you\u2019re horrible people because I disagree with you on a policy position,\u201d Freitas said.  Though Freitas framed his speech as a call for \u201cmutual respect,\u201d the comments shattered the House\u2019s usually collegial atmosphere, prompting several visibly upset Democrats, many of them African-American, to walk off the floor.  \u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, told a colleague as she left the chamber.  House Minority Leader David Toscano, D-Charlottesville, asked for a short recess, apparently to allow Democrats to gather their thoughts. Del. Dawn Adams, D-Richmond, approached Freitas at his desk for what appeared to be a tense conversation.  When lawmakers returned, Del. Joseph Lindsey, D-Norfolk, said the comments left him more offended than he\u2019s ever been since he was elected to the body in 2014.  \u201cI have seen many of my colleagues emotionally shaken and bothered by either a lack of concern for facts or just simply playing to the cameras,\u201d Lindsey said.  House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, then rose to say the party that routinely suggests Republicans have blood on their hands for defending gun rights was getting a taste of its own medicine.  \u201cIt\u2019s too much for many of us to stomach,\u201d Gilbert said.  Tensions flared again as Gilbert went on to suggest Democrats no longer care about holding criminals accountable for their crimes or making sure students who act out in schools are disciplined.  Toscano interrupted Gilbert to suggest he was violating House rules by telling willful untruths about his opponents.  \u201cWe\u2019d ask the speaker to sanction him for his inappropriate comments,\u201d Toscano said.  House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, trying to keep a lid on what was by far the most heated floor battle of his short tenure running the House, said: \u201cEveryone needs to take a deep breath. The delegate will wrap up his comments.\u201d  Speaking to reporters afterward, Freitas said he was frustrated that Democrats would take offense at a speech meant to convey that Republicans aren\u2019t guilty of the \u201cpretty horrible things\u201d Democrats often accuse them of. Freitas said he wasn\u2019t implying that legalized abortion leads to mass shootings, but that children being born out of wedlock leads to \u201cfar-reaching social ills.\u201d  He said his political campaign wasn\u2019t a factor in his decision to speak.  \u201cI don\u2019t base what I do off of Corey Stewart,\u201d Freitas said. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve given a floor speech on something I\u2019m passionate about.\u201d  A former Green Beret who has served in the House since 2016, Freitas is competing against Prince William Board of County Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart and a handful of others for the GOP nomination to take on Kaine this fall. Stewart, an anti-establishment candidate with a long history of provocative comments, recently questioned the manhood of House Republicans who support Medicaid expansion.  Freitas clashed with Del. Mark Levine, D-Alexandria, earlier this year during a subcommittee debate over guns. After Levine, a lawyer and broadcast political commentator, said that voting against universal background checks is a vote to give guns to gang members and terrorists, Freitas said he didn\u2019t appreciate the comment and said he knew more about fighting terrorists than a \u201cradio personality.\u201d  Republicans were infuriated last month after Levine sent out an email headlined \u201cHow the GOP Makes it Easy to Commit Mass Murder.\u201d  Freitas\u2019 comment about Democrats invoking segregation appeared to a be a reference to a floor speech by Del. Ken Plum, D-Fairfax. On Thursday, Plum compared the students leading the push for gun control to Barbara Johns, a young civil rights pioneer who led a student strike in Prince Edward County to protest substandard facilities at her segregated school.  \u201cI realized, by golly, we\u2019re in another Barbara Johns moment,\u201d Plum said.  As the session winds to a close, House Democrats have been calling on Republicans to reconsider gun-control bills that have already failed, arguing the Florida shooting that left 17 dead demands a legislative response.  Republican leaders have said that\u2019s not possible because of procedural rules that prevent the House from taking up its own bills late in the session as it\u2019s acting on bills that have passed the Senate.  Del. Tommy Wright, R-Lunenburg, the chairman of the House subcommittee that killed most of the Democrats\u2019 gun bills, gave his own floor speech Friday disputing the popular Democratic refrain that \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d are no longer enough after mass shootings. Saying America has taken God out of its schools, Wright said the country should turn to religion for help.  \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, prayers are enough,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThat is a problem. Our country has drifted. We\u2019re getting exactly what we have sown.\u201d  Speaking to reporters later in the day, Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, said he\u2019s still trying to work with Republicans on a comprehensive approach to reforming gun laws. His advice to lawmakers? Calm it down.  \u201cPeople get tired and they get testy, and I think everybody just has to try and relax and get their work done,\u201d said Northam, who said he didn\u2019t know specifics of what happened in the House and was speaking about frayed nerves in general. \u201cIn another week they\u2019ll be back at home.\u201d","articles_date":"2 3 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.richmond.com\/news\/virginia\/government-politics\/general-assembly\/sparking-chaos-on-house-floor-virginia-republican-suggests-abortion-industry\/article_a974c162-ce20-5cc4-9d36-82e5140a1f3b.html","articles_title":"Sparking chaos on House floor, Virginia Republican suggests 'abortion industry' and 'broken homes' contribute to mass shootings","candidate_fk":9,"first_name":"Nicholas","id":417,"issue":3,"last_name":"Freitas","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2},{"article_text":"(CNN)How did the Republican Party -- once known as the party of \"law and order\" -- become a party that could provide space for lawbreakers and extremists, thugs and criminals, hoodlums and hate groups? This astonishing transformation can only be attributed to the presidency of Donald Trump, whose words during the 2016 campaign and during his term in the White House helped make America safe for extremists.  White supremacists, Infowars conspiracy theorists and convicted criminals are running, some as viable candidates, on the GOP ticket on the state and federal level, something which would have been unheard of only a few years ago. Such individuals are not barred from putting their hat in the ring and aspiring for elected office, but it is remarkable that party leaders have by and large not shown the backbone to condemn them. But in a way that's not surprising in a party where extremism and intolerance are mainstream GOP fare, and its standard bearer runs an ethically challenged administration mired in criminal investigations. Trump said he would drain the swamp, but he is the swamp, and he is sending swamp-dwelling creatures to the Senate, Congress and the state house. Nancy Pelosi&#39;s mistake on identity politics Nancy Pelosi's mistake on identity politics A criminal record is no longer a barrier to entry for GOP candidates. There is nothing wrong with people being formerly incarcerated. After all, in a country that preaches rehabilitation yet practices gratuitous imprisonment and punishment for its own sake, society should encourage those who turn over a new leaf and want to contribute to their country through public service. However, keep in mind that we are not talking about the rehabilitated here. The candidates in question are doubling down on corruption and hate in Trump's party. Even former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn -- who is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI in connection with the Russia investigation -- is hitting the campaign trail and stumping for them. Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is running for Senate, after receiving a pardon from Trump for a contempt of court charge for failing to curb his anti-immigrant and anti-Latino racial profiling policies in violation of civil rights. Accused of racism and mistreatment of Latino prisoners, Arpaio failed to investigate over 400 sex crimes -- including the molestation of undocumented children -- made inmates wear pink underwear, called his tent city for inmates a concentration camp, and established the first chain gangs for juveniles and women. Paul Ryan&#39;s firing of Father Conroy should worry us all Paul Ryan's firing of Father Conroy should worry us all Arpaio, a prominent Birther who questioned President Obama's citizenship, received the blessing of Vice President Mike Pence, who, apparently rehearsing for a sooner-than-expected spot in the Oval Office, called Arpaio, \"A great friend of this president, a tireless champion of strong borders and the rule of law.\" In West Virginia, Don Blankenship, the former coal mining company head who went to prison for a year on mine safety charges that were brought after a disaster that killed 29 miners, is challenging Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Blankenship claims it was not racist to call Sen. Mitch McConnell's father-in-law a \"wealthy Chinaperson.\" (Donald Trump Jr. has urged voters in West Virginia to reject Blankenship and a GOP-establishment linked PAC is running ads against him, according to Politico.) In Staten Island, New York, former FBI agent and Rep. Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion, is making a comeback as a Trump loyalist after serving seven months behind bars. During his first stint in Congress, Grimm also threatened to break a reporter \"in half\" in 2014 following President Obama's State of the Union address. Kanye only cares about himself ... just like Trump Kanye only cares about himself ... just like Trump Running against Rep. Maxine Waters in California is Omar Navarro, who pleaded guilty to placing a tracking device on his wife's car. The extreme right wing, pro-Trump candidate has support from Michael Flynn and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and Navarro says Roger Stone serves as his adviser. And Rep. Greg Gianforte, who pleaded guilty to assault after body slamming a reporter, is running for re-election in Montana. Meanwhile, a report from Right Wing Watch, a project of People for the American Way, shines the light on a dozen far-right candidates who, typically inspired by Trump, are driving the Republican Party and American politics to the fringes. One of these people is Arthur Jones, who denies the Holocaust and was denounced as a Nazi by Illinois Republicans, yet became the GOP nominee in Illinois' 3rd district. Another is Paul Nehlen, a white supremacist who is a self-described \"pro-White Christian American candidate\" vying for House Speaker Paul Ryan's seat in Wisconsin. Black Trump supporters Diamond and Silk received $7,000 to star in a campaign ad supporting Nehlen. Twitter permanently banned Nehlen after he posted a photo depicting Prince Harry's biracial fianc\u00e9e Meghan Markle as \"Cheddar Man,\" a 9,000-year old dark-skinned prehistoric Briton.

E.W. Jackson, who tweeted video of Trump's remarks, said the comment came while Trump was trying to say that conservatives tend to get questioned more about their faith than liberals. \"I think everybody in there knows Hillary Clinton is a Methodist and by definition a Christian,\" Jackson told CNN. \"He was saying for those of us who are students of the Christian faith -- for evangelicals that can mean everything is thoroughly examined, like what do you believe about marriage? What do you believe about abortion?\" Jackson, who ran as the 2013 Republican nominee for lieutenant governor in Virginia, said he was \"accused of believing all kinds of crazy things\" when he was a politician. \"All (Trump) was saying was she hasn't had that same examination, so we don't really know what she believes,\" he added. Ken Blackwell, a Family Research Council fellow and Ohio politician, praised Trump's comments about \"protecting religious liberty and speech, because I know this administration -- and given that the Hillary administration will be a third term of Barack Obama, she would be a third term in her attack on religious liberty in general.\" \"I have no reason to attack her faith, I just question her ability to defend my right, my family's right, my church's right to practice our faith in the public square,\" Blackwell said. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B.

As the GOP establishment slowly coalesces around the presumptive nominee, the foot soldiers of the movement face an agonizing dilemma: whether to line up behind a candidate many members view as a ideological heretic or to stay true to their principles and reject him -- even though doing so could help Hillary Clinton claim the White House. The self-reflection is particularly acute for members of the influential Council for National Policy, an umbrella network of conservative activists -- the membership of which has been largely secret but can now be exclusively revealed to a greater extent than ever before by CNN. The Council was founded in 1981 by Tim LaHaye, the evangelical minister best known for the \"Left Behind\" series of prophesy-infused fiction books. CNN Politics app Uniting social, fiscal and religious conservatives, the CNP, nicknamed \"The Group,\" has prided itself for years on promoting conservative values and helping grassroots conservatives outside the GOP structure to coordinate and share ideas and information. Its membership is a powerful organizing force behind conservative candidates and has helped to cement the movement's aspirations deep in Republican Party ideology. A copy of the organization's membership list and directory obtained by CNN shows it mixes prominent conservative leaders like Brent Bozell III and Phyllis Schlafly with a smattering of former presidential candidates, business leaders and social activists. The group rarely courts publicity, but its members will be crucial in determining the amount of buy-in from social and evangelical conservatives for Trump's national campaign. Donald Trump's rough few days Trump starts from a position of weakness among CNP members, and the choice is particularly galling for some social conservatives because the 2016 election had seemed to offer the chance of nominating a candidate -- like Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio -- who was squarely in line with their core philosophy. Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council currently heads the executive committee of the CNP, and told CNN in an interview that Trump's takeover of the Republican Party is posing searching questions for the conservative grass-roots. He said it is incumbent upon Trump to reach out with tangible steps to quell anxiety in the movement if he is to ensure a strong GOP turnout in November. Nightcap: The latest news and political buss from CNN Politics | Sign up \"Many conservatives want to be able to be for Donald Trump because they fear the alternative, but they have not yet seen in him what they need to see to make the transition,\" Perkins said. \"There is not a lot that has transpired since Ted Cruz left the race and Donald Trump has been on the path to being the nominee -- he has not done anything that would make people change their minds.\" Another prominent member of the CNP is former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, who said he is \"slow walking\" his embrace of the Trump candidacy. In some ways, Blackwell said, promoting Trump would for conservatives be akin to snatching defeat from the jaws of victory if he does not accept their principles, after generations of trying to put conservative thought at the heart of U.S. government. \"I would say everybody wants to unify and everybody is mindful of the fact and respectful of the fact that Trump has weathered the storm of a primary,\" Blackwell said. \"But the vast majority of us are not ready to jettison our platform or the philosophy that has gotten us to this majority party status, the only other rung is the presidency.\" Better than Clinton Pragmatists among CNP members argue that while Trump may part with conservatives on many core issues -- including reining in the size of government, on opposing entitlement reform and in the often vulgar tone of his campaign, it is already clear he would be better for conservatives than the alternative -- Hillary Clinton. Schlafly, a pioneering conservative activist and founding member of the CNP, said that Trump is not the first Republican candidate to face questions about his personal authenticity as a conservative. Pro-Clinton super PAC to start airing general election ads targeting Trump \"I can remember 1980 when a lot of us didn't think Reagan was an authentic conservative. Reagan turned out to be best president of the century,\" she said. She backed Trump partly because he was the only candidate talking about illegal immigration, which she said was \"the most important issue in the country.\" Father Frank Pavone, a Roman Catholic priest who directs the Priests for Life organization, is backing Trump because he believes in the sincerity of his anti-abortion rights credentials -- despite doubts among other conservatives on his conversion from a previously pro-abortion rights position. \"No matter what uncertainties there might be about him, there are no uncertainties about where Clinton will go or anyone on the Democratic side on this issue in particular,\" Pavone said. \"A lot of people will come out with the statement that she is as bad as he is, but he is not on this issue particularly,\" said Pavone, who believes that Trump's change of attitude on abortion is \"real and sincere.\" Poll: Trump ahead in deep-red Georgia but Clinton in striking distance Pavone believes that now that Trump is the presumptive nominee and has a realistic chance of becoming President, he will moderate the antics and demeanor that have troubled many conservatives. \"From my own communication with people who have known, and worked with and advised Mr. Trump, I have got nothing but reassurance,\" Pavone said. \"I really think that that principle that the office shapes the man is going to kick in very strongly.\" Perkins suggests that the presumptive nominee could make some tangible moves to bring values voters along with him. One visible step would be to pick a vice presidential nominee who is trusted by evangelical and social conservatives. \"Is there someone that we will have a confidence in that has a track record because past performance in the best indicator of future performance,\" said Perkins. Alternatively, Trump could reassure conservatives by enlisting a trusted member of the community, like Cruz to help vet his judicial nominees \u2014 an intensely acute matter for conservatives, given the open seat that belonged to late Justice Antonin Scalia. In fact, the open Supreme Court seat could emerge as substantial leverage for Trump to corral conservatives behind his campaign given fears in the movement that Clinton could select her own liberal nominee who could sit on the court for decades. Trump may already be heading in that direction. CNN's Dana Bash reported Friday that the billionaire told House leadership officials in a meeting on Thursday that he would produce a list of potential nominees in coordination with the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. But other CNP members are just not ready to make that leap of faith. Kim Bengard, a businesswoman and social conservative activist from California, does not believe that Trump's conversion on abortion is genuine. After swallowing her reservations to side with previous moderate Republican nominees like Bob Dole, John McCain and Mitt Romney, Bengard has hit the end of the line with Trump. \"I can't do it,\" Bengard said, adding that she believes the billionaire's anti-abortion rights position is simply one of convenience. \"I don't believe he is a Republican. He is certainly not a conservative,\" said Bengard. \"I am going to in the end walk away with my convictions intact. I won't vote the top of the ticket, I am sad and horrified about what is ahead of us,\" Bengard said, adding she would restrict herself to down-ticket races in the current election season. Inside \"The Group\" CNP may be the most powerful group whose members you didn't know. As the group explains on its website, which provides no membership information, the CNP \"brings together the country's most influential conservative leaders in business, government, politics, religion, and academia to hear and learn from policy experts on a wide range of issues.\" The membership list is ''strictly confidential,\" a CNP memo obtained by The New York Times in 2004 noted. ''The media should not know when or where we meet or who takes part in our programs, before or after a meeting.\" In 2014 and 2015, several GOP presidential candidates -- Cruz, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, Dr. Ben Carson, Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sen. Rand Paul, and former Sen. Rick Santorum, among others -- spoke with CNP members in the hopes of securing their support. At the end of 2015, conservative activist leaders linked to \"The Group\" voted to support Cruz in the primaries but in February, as reported by the National Review,members of the Group began expressing concerns about Cruz's viability. But the CNP itself says that it does not endorse candidates and does not hold straw polls showing presidential preference. The ranks of members are made up of grassroots conservatives who, according to their Values Statement, \"value the power of collaborative networking among conservative leaders to strengthen the movement and its impact.\" CNN obtained a CNP membership directory from 2014, when Perkins was vice president of the executive committee and the president was Stuart Epperson, co-founder and chairman of Salem Communications. Secretary. Treasurer of the Group was John Scribante, Chief Executive Officer at Orion Energy Systems, Inc. Several former GOP presidential candidates are listed, including Santorum, Gary Bauer, Herman Cain, Steve Forbes and Jim Gilmore. The leaders of key conservative and like-minded groups are also on the roster, such as Citizens United President David Bossie, former Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, Tea Party Express Chairman Amy Kremer, National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre, Club for Growth leader David McIntosh, Judicial Watch President Thomas Fitton, Operation Rescue President Troy Newman, Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, and Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. Other boldfaced names, organizers and donors familiar in the conservative world include: Foster Freiss; Ralph Reed, Bishop E.W. Jackson, Ed Meese, former Reagan-era Energy and Interior secretary Don Hodel, Linda Bean, James Dobson, and Bain Capital Managing Director Louis Bremer.

Listed on the 2014 roster are: Joseph Farah, founder and CEO of WND; Christopher Ruddy, Newsmax founder, CEO and president; and Neil Patel, co-founder of The Daily Caller. The pursuit of the Group's goals is augmented by CNP Action, Inc., a sister organization that \"promotes issues or specific pieces of legislation through regular publications and standing committee workshops,\" according to its website, and is headed by Gary Aldrich, the former FBI Agent whose 1996 book detailed accusations of security breaches at then-President Bill Clinton's White House. The CNP's influence is beyond dispute. Reporter Marc Ambinder noted that shortly after \"candidate George W. Bush spoke before a closed-press CNP session in San Antonio...magisterial conservatives pronounced the allegedly moderate younger Bush fit for the mantle of Republican leadership.\" (Ambinder allowed that the two moments might not have been directly connected.) But while the impact of the CNP is clear, it is less certain that conservatives who have spent decades fighting to insert their ideology at the heart of government will present a united front in the coming fall election. But for those conservatives who are still wavering about endorsing Trump or who might be tempted by a possible third party candidate, Schlafly, who has impeccable conservative credentials after a lifetime on the front-lines of the ideological struggle, has a simple message. \"I remind people we are a two party system. If you like a third party or some other way, you can move to Europe \u2014 You have got to pick one.

That might be expected on a college campus but it should still be encouraging for candidates and Republican Party officials to see so much interest from young voters.  UVA College Republicans Freitas Stewart JacksonAt the same time, however, it should be worrisome for those same candidates and party officials that the audience was overwhelmingly male, demonstrating (anecdotally, at least) that the GOP faces a gender gap as it challenges incumbent Senator Tim Kaine (D-Richmond) in November and as it defends seven of eleven congressional seats against Democratic opponents.  The debate, moderated by Batten School Dean Allan C. Stam, was delightfully civil. Not only were there no catcalls or demonstrations from the audience, the three candidates \u2014 Delegate Nick Freitas, Bishop E.W. Jackson, and Prince William County Board Chairman Corey Stewart \u2014 treated each other and their listeners with respect. There were few instances of snarky comments from any of the participants and, what\u2019s more, the discussion was entirely policy-focused. There were no questions about character, temperament, reputation, or moral shortcomings aimed at one candidate or another.  The three candidates agreed that there should be reform of marijuana laws, with Stewart suggesting that legal medical marijuana is a partial solution to the opioid crisis \u2014 although his primary solution is to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d at the Mexican border to keep out both illegal drugs and illegal immigrants.  All three expressed dismay at the passage of the omnibus spending bill, which was pushed through Congress by Republican leadership and signed into law by a Republican president. Each warned, at one point or another, that the Social Security system is headed toward collapse and that continued deficit spending and accumulation of debt is a national security issue. (They may be unconsciously echoing Libertarian Senate candidate Matt Waters, who has declared this issue as the centerpiece of his campaign.)  Delegate Freitas repeatedly mentioned his military service \u2014 two tours in Iraq, training South Korean special forces \u2014 as well as his experience in the General Assembly as preparation for the U.S. Senate, noting in particular his bill to reform civil asset forfeiture laws, which, he said, had the support of both the Family Foundation and the ACLU.  Bishop Jackson said his experience as a statewide candidate in 2013, when he was the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, prepared him to challenge Tim Kaine. He praised the United States for making it possible for him, the great-grandson of slaves, to run for the United States Senate, and said that participation in the democratic process should not be limited, whether a citizen is black or white, transgender or gay, rich or poor.  For his part, Chairman Stewart stated he was not campaigning to \u201cmake friends,\u201d asserted that anthropogenic climate change is \u201ca hoax,\u201d and called high-school gun control advocate David Hogg a \u201cpunk.\u201d He said that mayors and other public officials who choose not to cooperate in federal immigration-law enforcement efforts should be prosecuted and jailed.  For those who were unable to attend \u2014 by order of the fire marshal, the largest classroom in Garrett Hall at UVA can only accommodate 180 people \u2014 here is video of the entire debate, divided into four unequal parts:  After the debate ended, I interviewed College Republicans chairman Adam Kimelman, who organized the debate; Nick Freitas; and Corey Stewart. E.W. Jackson, unfortunately, slipped out of the building before I could talk to him. All three of these interviews will be on The Score this week.

With fewer than six weeks to go before the June 12 Republican primary that will decide the party\u2019s nominee for the U.S. Senate and the principal challenger to incumbent Senator Tim Kaine, the three candidates for the Virginia GOP\u2019s nomination are criss-crossing the Commonwealth in search of voters, volunteers, and money.  Senate Candidates Nick Freitas Charlottesville headquartersLast weekend in Charlottesville, two of those candidates held public appearances. Delegate Nick Freitas opened up his local campaign headquarters with pizza and soft drinks, attracting a crowd that was about half students from the University of Virginia and half long-time activists and volunteers from Albemarle County and the City of Charlottesville.  I caught up with Delegate Freitas just before he went inside his new headquarters building. I asked him not only about his Senate campaign, but also about the recent General Assembly session, which will reconvene on May 14th to deal with a still-unfinished state budget.  A couple of days after I spoke with Nick Freitas, another candidate for the U.S. Senate nomination came to Charlottesville to deliver a speech on race relations. E.W. Jackson, who was also the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor in 2013, addressed a crowd of between 130 and 150 people that was, ironically \u2013 given the nature of his topic \u2013 about 95 percent white, or Americans of European ancestry. A majority of the audience looked to be older than sixty years of age, as well.  E.W. Jackson Charlottesville DoubletreeBefore his speech, I had some one-on-one time with E.W. Jackson to ask about his campaign, evangelical support for Donald Trump, and how Tim Kaine is vulnerable in November. My first question was about his campaign\u2019s fundraising, which, according to finance reports, is lagging behind his opponents.  Later in the show, E.W. Jackson is featured in our \u201cFrom the Archives\u201d segment. That interview took place almost precisely six years (April 28, 2012) before our most recent chat (April 29, 2018), when Jackson first ran for the U.S. Senate in Virginia.  There\u2019s politics outside Virginia. Not long ago, I had an opportunity to interview the Mayor of Johannesburg, South Africa. While that was a lengthy interview, this brief excerpt has a lot of heft to it. I asked the Mayor how Johannesburg is able to create sufficient employment for the many people who migrate there from the countryside and from nearby countries like Zimbabwe.  General Assembly Delegate Rob Bell represents all of Greene County and parts of Albemarle, Fluvanna, and Rockingham counties. He is one of three Members of the House of Delegates who share the surname \u201cBell.\u201d (The others are Dickie Bell of Staunton and John Bell of Chantilly.) Two Republicans, one Democrat named Bell make up 3 per cent of the House of Delegates. Go figure.  When I ran into him at the opening of the Freitas for Senate campaign headquarters, I asked Delegate Rob Bell about the recent General Assembly session \u2013 or current session, since it reconvenes on May 14 to deal with the budget. Again.  Local History Virginia has a lot of history in it, as you would expect from the state that had the first permanent English colony in North America, dating to the establishment of Jamestown in 1607. Giants of American history have roamed Virginia\u2019s mountains and valleys, including George Washington, Patrick Henry, and the three presidents who came from the Charlottesville area \u2013 Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe.  In the shadow of these national figures is local history \u2013 belonging to the individuals, families, businesses, and civic groups that contribute to the prosperity, politics, and sometimes scandals of our towns, cities, and counties.  I spoke to Will Lyster, who recently became president of the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society and promptly had the bylaws changed so his title is now chairman rather than president. I asked him about the importance of local historical societies like the one he heads up and what we can learn from local history.  At the Movies Film critic Tim Hulsey is back and his review of Avengers: Infinity War is sure to stir up some debate. The movie stars Chris Hemsworth, Tom Holland, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, and scores of other super heroes and super villains. I expect we\u2019ll be getting comments below from lots of listeners after they hear what Tim has to say about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. (MCU fans are jealously protective of their film domain.)  Little Pink HouseSpeaking of movies, Little Pink House (which Tim reviewed last week) is slowly making its way around the country in an unusual arrangement at odds with normal film distribution patterns. There may be a screening in Charlottesville on June 28, if enough people buy tickets in advance. The Score will talk to Nelson County property rights activist Doug Hornig in the episode scheduled to air on May 19.  Next week\u2019s episode of The Score will tentatively feature interviews with Randolph Byrd, former chair of the Fifth Congressional District GOP Committee, and Eric Xu, editor-in-chief of the Virginia Review of Politics, an undergraduate publication at UVA.","articles_date":"3 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.richmond.com\/news\/virginia\/government-politics\/corey-stewart-says-gop-establishment-wants-to-stop-him-from\/article_2a732d2e-dfa4-5ed8-9f50-0c98609fc074.html","articles_title":"Corey Stewart says GOP establishment wants to stop him from winning Senate nomination","candidate_fk":10,"first_name":"E.W.","id":422,"issue":8,"last_name":"Jackson","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2},{"article_text":"If you pay attention to how much money candidates are raising \u2013 and more importantly in many ways, from which individuals, corporate interests, etc. \u2013 you look forward to the quarterly campaign finance filing deadlines with the Federal Elections Commission. One of those deadlines just passed, on April 15, and overwhelmingly, Virginia\u2019s federal (U.S. House and U.S. Senate) candidates managed to get their reports in on time, or at least very close to on time (I\u2019ve been posting the numbers here as I see them).  That is, all the federal candidates managed to do that\u2026with four glaring exceptions: 1) Democrat Charlotte Moore in VA-06, who shows absolutely no 1Q18 (or any other) campaign finance information on the FEC website; 2) Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Nick Freitas; 3) Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Corey Stewart and 4) Republican candidate for U.S. Senate E.W. Jackson, Sr.  What on earth is going on here?  According to the FEC website:  Under the Commission\u2019s mandatory electronic filing regulations, individuals and organizations required to file with the FEC that receive contributions or make expenditures, including independent expenditures, aggregating in excess of $50,000 in a calendar year \u2014 or have reason to expect to do so \u2014 must file all reports and statements electronically.  Reports filed electronically must be received and validated by the Commission by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the filing date. Electronic filers who file on paper or submit an electronic report that does not pass the Commission\u2019s validation program by that time on the filing deadline will be considered nonfilers and may be subject to enforcement actions, including administrative fines.  So that seems clear, right? You have to file by the deadline \u2013 in this case April 15 \u2013 or you can be subject to \u201cenforcement actions.\u201d Except that it gets a bit complicated when it comes to U.S. Senate candidates:  Senate campaigns and other committees supporting Senate candidates must file their FEC reports with the Secretary of the Senate on paper, but may file an additional unofficial electronic copy of their report with the Commission in order to enhance disclosure.  Wait, really? The FEC actually says that U.S. Senate candidates HAVE TO file on PAPER, with only an OPTION to file electronically as well? What, are we back in the 1950s (where Republicans would like to take the country) or something? But yes, believe it or not, this is actually the case in the year 2018, despite what I\u2019m told have been multiple efforts to change that idiotic rule \u2013 none of which have passed. F\u2019ed up, I know. But still, note that there\u2019s absolutely nothing preventing U.S. Senate candidates from also filing electronically. So why wouldn\u2019t they do that in addition to filing on paper? Hmmmm\u2026  Which brings us to the Republican U.S. Senate campaigns of Nick Freitas, Corey Stewart and EW Jackson, none of whom currently show any information for 1Q18 on the FEC website. But before we get to them, though, note that Sen. Tim Kaine\u2019s information was filed on time, as it should have been, and includes detailed, itemized receipt and disbursement information, again as it should! Why this matters is simple: so that the voters can see who the candidates for federal office are receiving their money from and what they are spending that money on. It\u2019s called \u201ctransparency,\u201d aka \u201cgiving voters the information they need to make informed decisions.\u201d  And clearly. Sen. Tim Kaine takes all that seriously, as of course he should. Meanwhile, in stark-but-oh-so-revealing contrast, Republicans Nick Freitas, Corey Stewart and EW Jackson apparently don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s hindquarters if Virginia GOP primary voters are informed, at least not in a timely fashion, regarding where they\u2019re getting their money and what they\u2019re spending it on. Why is that? Do they have things they\u2019d rather Virginia GOP voters not see, at least not in a timely fashion? Are they simply embarrassed at how badly they\u2019re getting blown out of the water by Sen. Tim Kaine? Both?  By the way, even if Nick, Corey and EW filed by paper only, and even if the FEC still hasn\u2019t posted that information, there is absolutely nothing stopping Nick, Corey and EW from putting our press releases with detailed information on their 1Q18 campaign fundraising and expenditures. Yet so far, all we have is a press release from Nick Freitas\u2019 campaign reporting \u201c$343,712 raised and more than $250,000 cash-on-hand,\u201d with \u201c5,373 individual donors, giving an average of $63.97.\u201d Again, no details regarding who those donors might be, or where his money\u2019s going. Still, it\u2019s better than Corey Stewart and EW Jackson, neither of whom has released any information whatsoever about their 1Q18 campaign finances, now four days after the April 15 filing deadline.  In sum, it appears that none of the three Virginia Republican U.S. Senate candidates \u2013 Nick Freitas, Corey Stewart and EW Jackson \u2013 care very much whether or not GOP primary voters have the information they need to make informed choices regarding who to support. In stark contrast, Sen. Tim Kaine actually respects voters (what a concept!), as well as the law, and has done exactly what he should have done. I guess it\u2019s not surprising that the contrast between Kaine and his far-right\/extreme opponents is so stark \u2013 on this and on everything else. Something to keep in mind as we move into the general election between Kaine and one of these clowns\u2026  P.S. As for Charlotte Moore in VA-06, who the hell knows what\u2019s going on there? Very strange.","articles_date":"4 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.citypages.com\/news\/duluths-confederate-yankee-corey-stewart-rides-again-in-virginia-senate-race\/481653241","articles_title":"Corey Stewart rides again in Virginia Senate race","candidate_fk":10,"first_name":"E.W.","id":423,"issue":8,"last_name":"Jackson","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2},{"article_text":"Virginia Republican Corey Stewart is accusing GOP leaders of favoring a rival for the nomination to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., despite the party's claim of neutrality in the June 12 primary.  Stewart, the bombastic chairman of the Prince William Board of Supervisors, said party leaders secretly back Nick Freitas, a two-term state lawmaker from the Piedmont Valley - a charge the state GOP denied.  \"He's a stooge for the establishment,\" Stewart said during a 10-minute-long news conference outside the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee Thursday afternoon. \"They're trying to use him to keep my name off the [general election] ballot.\"  In addition to Freitas, Stewart is also competing with E.W. Jackson, a Chesapeake minister. All three men are Trump admirers.  But Stewart has portrayed himself as an anti-establishment candidate and the only person who can turn out Trump voters in November.  \"You've got the Republican establishment essentially colluding with the Democratic establishment to keep Trump supporters off the ballot in November,\" Stewart said, noting a Washington Post story from December that described the NRSC's efforts to find an alternative candidate to Stewart, who launched his campaign last July.  The NRSC did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.  Virginia GOP Chairman John Whitbeck said the party treats all primary candidates the same. \"To quote President Trump, 'There is no collusion. Total witch hunt',\" he said.  Stewart's recent line of attack comes two days after Senate GOP hopeful Ivan Raiklin filed a lawsuit disputing the party's finding that he did not collect enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. He also said Whitbeck encouraged Raiklin to support Freitas.  Whitbeck called the claim \"fake news.\"  \"Because of the pending lawsuit we can't go into details at this point,\" Whitbeck said, \"however the quickest way to get attention is to attack your own party. This is a tactic many disgruntled Republicans use to get media attention.\"  Raiklin said Thursday he didn't think the party was stacking the deck in favor of Freitas.  \"In my eight months of doing this as a political newcomer,\" Raiklin said, \"I give everyone the benefit of the doubt and I don't see that.\"  Freitas said he enjoys more support from Virginia Republicans than Stewart because he is opposed to tax hikes. He noted the Prince William Board of Supervisors, which Stewart chairs, approved average tax increase of 4.5 percent in 2014.  \"It's no surprise or conspiracy that Virginia Republican voters want a candidate who has not raised taxes on their constituents,\" Freitas said in a statement. \"Corey is exploiting Ivan Raiklin for his own political expedience, much like he did during the presidential race.\"  Stewart took a similar position in his unsuccessful campaign for the GOP nomination for governor against Ed Gillespie last year and during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he protested oustide the Republican National Committee headquarters and warned the national party against abandoning Trump. Hours later, Stewart was booted as chairman of Trump's Virginia campaign.  Jackson said he does not believe the state GOP is giving preferential treatment to any of the primary candidates.  \"However,\" Jackson said, \"anyone can see a lot of the politicians are lining up behind Nick. I'm not worried about that. I think a lot of people are tired of politicians, of being told how to vote... All of that is precisely what has the average voter incensed.\"  Freitas has been endorsed by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., former Governor Robert McDonnell and Morton Blackwell, one of two of Virginia's representatives on the Republican National Committee, as well as many of his colleagues in the legislature.  He made a controversial speech in defense of the Second Amendment on the floor of the General Assembly weeks after the Parkland school shooting, raising his profile somewhat and helping him surpass Stewart and Jackson in fundraising by the end of March with $251,694 cash on hand.  The war chest is a tiny fraction of the $16 million Kaine has amassed in his campaign for a second term.","articles_date":"1 5 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/pilotonline.com\/news\/government\/politics\/article_9ae48616-4a06-5f81-acf5-e1ee7501bbc5.html","articles_title":"Virginia Republican Senate candidates repeatedly attack Obama, barely mention Kaine","candidate_fk":10,"first_name":"E.W.","id":424,"issue":8,"last_name":"Jackson","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2},{"article_text":"GOP Senate candidate Corey Stewart complained at a news conference in Washington on Thursday that Republican leaders were trying to stop him from winning the nomination in the three-way primary.  He cited as evidence some facts from a federal lawsuit over ballot access that longshot former GOP candidate Ivan Raiklin filed Tuesday against the Republican Party of Virginia and the commonwealth.  \u201cHe says that party leaders approached him and said that they wanted him to drop out and support my opponent Nick Freitas,\u201d Stewart said at a news conference outside the offices of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Freitas, a state lawmaker from Culpeper, and minister E.W. Jackson of Chesapeake are vying with Stewart in the June 12 primary for the chance to face Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.  Raiklin said in an interview Thursday that Stewart\u2019s description of the lawsuit was \u201cfairly accurate\u201d but \u201csomewhat of a stretch.\u201d  \u201cNo, he never said drop out,\u201d Raiklin said of a conversation he had with state GOP Chairman John Whitbeck.  But Raiklin said he did get a sense during a March 29 phone call with Whitbeck that the party chairman favored Freitas. \u201cThat\u2019s how I received it, absolutely,\u201d Raiklin said.  Raiklin\u2019s lawsuit, filed in federal court, alleges that the state GOP illegally made errors in the process for certifying whether he obtained enough voter signatures to get on the primary ballot. He also alleges that the Virginia Department of Elections should have heard his appeal and challenges the constitutionality of a state law related to verifying valid signatures.  A statement of facts in Raiklin\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Whitbeck called Raiklin on March 29 to tell him he didn\u2019t make the ballot, and \u201curged Raiklin that his next call after hanging up with Whitbeck should be to Delegate Nick Freitas.\u201d  Stewart\u2019s camp has seized on that as evidence that Whitbeck tried to pressure Raiklin, a former Green Beret in the Army, into endorsing Freitas.  Raiklin said he told Whitbeck during the call he was disappointed the party didn\u2019t certify him for the ballot. During the discussion, Whitbeck asked him if he supported any of the other candidates, and Raiklin said he would be in favor of a Green Beret, meaning Freitas, who is also a Green Beret. And it was after that, Raiklin said, that Whitbeck said he should call Freitas to offer support.  In hindsight, Raiklin said, he wishes he would have not included information about his call with Whitbeck in the lawsuit because \u201cthat is not my focus.\u201d  The point of his lawsuit, he said, is to educate people about flaws in the process and how the party has final say in who gets on a primary ballot.  The Republican Party of Virginia issued a statement Tuesday saying \u201cno such conversation happened.\u201d The party declined further comment Thursday on the call. Raiklin will livestream a statement addressing his dispute with the party at 10 a.m. Friday from James Madison\u2019s Montpelier in Orange County.  As far as other evidence that the Republican establishment was trying to stop him, Stewart cited an anonymous source in a Dec. 7 Washington Post story who was described as being \u201cfamiliar with the thinking at the NRSC,\u201d the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  The source said national party leaders say, \u201cWe don\u2019t care if we can beat Kaine or not. [Stewart is] an embarrassment,\u201d according to the story.  Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, has been running longer than Freitas and Jackson, having announced his run about a month after narrowly losing to Ed Gillespie in the 2017 GOP primary for governor.","articles_date":"5 12 2017","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/virginia-politics\/ew-jackson-conservative-firebrand-preparing-us-senate-bid-in-virginia\/2017\/12\/05\/ddccfdc6-d9e1-11e7-b859-fb0995360725_story.html?utm_term=.f0baea99c11d","articles_title":"E.W.

He\u2019s also a neo-Confederate -- a kind of ideology that lives in a Stranger Things Upside Down where the Civil War is referred to as \u201cThe War of Northern Aggression,\u201d Confederate General Stonewall Jackson was a \u201cgood and honorable and noble man,\u201d and southerners fought for states\u2019 rights rather than slavery.  It\u2019s the kind of mindset that has one attending \u201cOld South\u201d themed galas, defending Confederate monuments, and using the word \u201cYankee\u201d as a slur. Though, as a Duluth native, he is, technically, a Yankee. But still.  Apparently it\u2019s been working out for him. Last year, Stewart almost bagged the Republican gubernatorial nomination, even as his openness about being a Confederate flaghead earned him condemnations from his own party -- and his fellow Prince William County supervisors. He managed to come within one percentage point of his primary rival, Ed Gillespie.  He still managed to get further than anyone thought he would. The near miss was chalked up to another example of the anti-establishment politics that analysts attribute to the rise of Trump. It was around that time that he started floating the idea of running against Virginia\u2019s Democratic senator, Tim Kaine.  That\u2019s just what he did, and his hyper conservative politics are going gangbusters. He\u2019s considered the GOP frontrunner in the Virginia Senate race. There\u2019s less mention now of the Confederacy, but Stewart is still operating on an \u201cus vs. them\u201d basis with himself positioned \u201cwith President Trump,\u201d opposing \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d \u201cillegal immigration,\u201d and the \u201cWashington elites,\u201d according to his website.  And the language of his campaign remains\u2026 colorful.  His two main populist planks appear to be gun rights...  Although among his more recent targets seem to be the invading scourge that is girls joining the Boy Scouts.  He\u2019s not shying away from the fact that he\u2019s originally from Minnesota. That\u2019s all in his campaign bio, with descriptions of his \u201cworking class family\u201d and growing up a longshoreman\u2019s son.  A survey of Republican voters taken by Christopher Newport University in early March marked him as a nose ahead of fellow Republicans Nick Freitas and E. W. Jackson. That may not be saying much, because 66 percent of the respondents said they hadn\u2019t decided on a candidate yet.  Noel Fritsch, a spokesperson for Stewart's campaign, says that defending Confederate monuments its still very much a part of Stewart's platform.  \"The issue is really rule of law,\" he says. \"That's what it comes down to.\"","articles_date":"19 4 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/virginia-politics\/va-legislator-freitas-raises-nearly-350000-in-bid-to-take-on-tim-kaine\/2018\/04\/19\/dafec5ce-4373-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html?utm_term=.dcf1fecfe6c3","articles_title":"Virginia legislator Freitas raises nearly $350,000 in bid to take on Tim Kaine","candidate_fk":10,"first_name":"E.W.","id":426,"issue":8,"last_name":"Jackson","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2},{"article_text":"Nick Freitas and E.W. Jackson, two of three Republicans seeking the party\u2019s nod to run against U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in November, barely mentioned the Democrat in their debate Monday night, but repeatedly berated former President Barack Obama, who left office 15 months ago.  In responding to a moderator\u2019s questions in front of about 75 Republicans at dinner in The Town Center Club, the candidates expressed similar views on the nation\u2019s overseas wars, tax policy, health care and immigration. Both also praised President Donald Trump, arguing that he has projected a stronger brand of leadership during his first year than Obama did in eight years in the White House.  Freitas, a state delegate from Culpeper County, said he first became interested in a political career while an Army Green Beret serving his second tour in Iraq in 2008, when he learned Obama had been elected president. Freitas said he was \u201creally confused\u201d and felt it was wrong that Americans chose \u201ca philosophy which was trying to convince them that just handing a little bit more power over to the government, a little bit more freedom, a little bit more of their choices \u2013 that the government would take care of them.\u201d  Jackson, a Chesapeake minister who served in the Marines in the 1970s, contended Obama disliked the armed services: \u201cFor eight years, we kind of all knew that the president didn\u2019t really care about the military. They were kind of side note. We\u2019ve got a president now who genuinely loves our military.\u201d  The third candidate in the June 12 GOP statewide primary, Prince William County Board Chairman Corey Stewart, did not attend the event sponsored by the Republican Professionals Network.  Freitas and Jackson also leveled scorn at the Affordable Care Act, which is considered one of Obama\u2019s major accomplishments. Freitas called it a \u201ccancer\u201d that was designed to fail so that its supporters could replace it with a national government health care system. He and Jackson want to abolish what remains of the law, known as Obamacare. They said a competitive, market-based health care system will lead to lower prices and better services.  Both candidates opposed the Obama Administration\u2019s Iran nuclear agreement that delayed the country\u2019s development of nuclear weapons and praised Trump for threatening to quash it. The Republican president is taking a more aggressive stance against Iran and North Korea that will get results, the candidates said.  Jackson said Trump\u2019s tweets insulting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un by calling him \u201crocket man\u201d show Trump is a \u201cmasterful negotiator\u201d because Kim now wants to negotiate.  The candidates supported Trump\u2019s plans for tighter immigration controls, including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. They praised the recent tax overhaul law passed by the Republican-controlled Congress.  Freitas said the tax changes don\u2019t go far enough. He favors abolishing the federal income tax entirely, replacing it with a national sales tax \u2013 known by supporters as a \u201cfair tax.\u201d  Although Kaine was never mentioned, both Republicans agreed with the incumbent\u2019s long-standing view that Congress has wrongly avoided debating and voting on the long-term use of military forces overseas.  Jackson and Freitas, who both want the United States to withdraw almost all its troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, said they supported Trump\u2019s launching of airstrikes against Syria in response to that country\u2019s use of chemical weapons on its civilians. But they argued the president shouldn\u2019t be able to commit troops to long-term conflicts without congressional action.  Freitas said Congress cannot be allowed to \u201ccompletely abrogate its responsibility and simply say when the war\u2019s popular \u2018We got your back,\u2019 and as soon as the war is not popular, \u2018It\u2019s on you Mr. President.\u2019 ...

Along with the still-to-be-chosen Republican nominee, Waters will challenge incumbent Senator Tim Kaine.  A native Virginian whose roots go back to the original settlers at Jamestown on one side of his family, he is also the grandson of recent immigrants from Central Europe. Raised in Hampton Roads, he earned his undergraduate degree at George Mason University. Professionally, he has worked as a fundraising consultant for political causes and non-profit organizations.  In his speech to the LPVA delegates and in an interview with Bearing Drift (listen for it next week on The Score), Waters emphasized that his highest concern is the national debt, which he views as unsustainable. Citing a report from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he said the debt is the biggest national security threat to the United States, greater than ISIS or Russia or China.   Waters describes himself as a pro-life Libertarian (\u201ccard-carrying\u201d since 2008, he says) and a firm supporter of the Second Amendment \u2014 he takes a concealed weapon with him wherever he goes. He is also a home-schooling father of five children.  Like other statewide candidates, Waters must collect a minimum of 10,000 valid signatures of registered voters from across the Commonwealth, including 400 signatures from each of Virginia\u2019s eleven congressional delegates, to qualify to have his name on the November general election ballot. The deadline for submitting those petitions to the State Board of Elections is 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, June 12, the same day that the GOP will choose its standard-bearer for the U.S. Senate race.  Like Cliff Hyra, who ran for governor in 2017, and Robert Sarvis, who ran for governor in 2013 and the U.S. Senate in 2014, one of Waters\u2019 goals is to reach the high threshold of 10 percent of the popular vote necessary to qualify the Libertarian Party of Virginia as a major party alongside the Democrats and Republicans. This would alleviate the substantial burden of ballot-access efforts that drains the party\u2019s treasury every time it seeks to run statewide candidates. Related to that, Waters also said he wants to improve the party\u2019s fundraising capacity and build lists of donors and volunteers to help future candidates.  In addition to nominating Waters, the LPVA convention elected party officers and delegates to the party\u2019s midterm national convention in New Orleans. LP members also heard from three of its nominees for the U.S. House of Representatives: Pete Wells, who is challenging incumbent Democrat Donald McEachin in the Fourth Congressional District; Joe Walton, who is running in the Seventh Congressional District against incumbent Republican Dave Brat; and Stevan Porter, who will face off against incumbent Democrat Gerry Connolly in the Eleventh District.  Like Senate candidate Matt Waters, the nominees for the U.S. House must submit petitions due on the same day as the June primary. They each must collect a minimum of 1,000 signatures of registered voters from within their districts.","articles_date":"11 3 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/bearingdrift.com\/2018\/03\/11\/virginia-libertarians-nominate-candidate-u-s-senate\/","articles_title":"Virginia Libertarians Nominate Candidate for U.S. Senate","candidate_fk":13,"first_name":"Matt","id":432,"issue":8,"last_name":"Waters","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":2},{"article_text":"And in other news largely ignored by Virginia media over the weekend\u2026 The Libertarian Party of Virginia nominated Matt Waters, an Alexandria fund-raising consultant, as its candidate for U.S. Senate.

In his speech to LPVA delegates, Waters said his biggest concern is the unsustainable national debt. He characterized the $21 trillion debt as the United States\u2019 biggest national security threat, greater than ISIS or China, and he called for an end to the failed war on drugs, the war on terror, and the war on poverty.  Vowing to campaign under the Virginia flag, the motto of which is, \u201cThus always to tyrants,\u201d Waters said:  My campaign will call fellow Virginians to remember who we are, and why we fight.

That might be expected on a college campus but it should still be encouraging for candidates and Republican Party officials to see so much interest from young voters.  UVA College Republicans Freitas Stewart JacksonAt the same time, however, it should be worrisome for those same candidates and party officials that the audience was overwhelmingly male, demonstrating (anecdotally, at least) that the GOP faces a gender gap as it challenges incumbent Senator Tim Kaine (D-Richmond) in November and as it defends seven of eleven congressional seats against Democratic opponents.  The debate, moderated by Batten School Dean Allan C. Stam, was delightfully civil. Not only were there no catcalls or demonstrations from the audience, the three candidates \u2014 Delegate Nick Freitas, Bishop E.W. Jackson, and Prince William County Board Chairman Corey Stewart \u2014 treated each other and their listeners with respect. There were few instances of snarky comments from any of the participants and, what\u2019s more, the discussion was entirely policy-focused. There were no questions about character, temperament, reputation, or moral shortcomings aimed at one candidate or another.  The three candidates agreed that there should be reform of marijuana laws, with Stewart suggesting that legal medical marijuana is a partial solution to the opioid crisis \u2014 although his primary solution is to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d at the Mexican border to keep out both illegal drugs and illegal immigrants.  All three expressed dismay at the passage of the omnibus spending bill, which was pushed through Congress by Republican leadership and signed into law by a Republican president. Each warned, at one point or another, that the Social Security system is headed toward collapse and that continued deficit spending and accumulation of debt is a national security issue. (They may be unconsciously echoing Libertarian Senate candidate Matt Waters, who has declared this issue as the centerpiece of his campaign.)  Delegate Freitas repeatedly mentioned his military service \u2014 two tours in Iraq, training South Korean special forces \u2014 as well as his experience in the General Assembly as preparation for the U.S. Senate, noting in particular his bill to reform civil asset forfeiture laws, which, he said, had the support of both the Family Foundation and the ACLU.  Bishop Jackson said his experience as a statewide candidate in 2013, when he was the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, prepared him to challenge Tim Kaine. He praised the United States for making it possible for him, the great-grandson of slaves, to run for the United States Senate, and said that participation in the democratic process should not be limited, whether a citizen is black or white, transgender or gay, rich or poor.  For his part, Chairman Stewart stated he was not campaigning to \u201cmake friends,\u201d asserted that anthropogenic climate change is \u201ca hoax,\u201d and called high-school gun control advocate David Hogg a \u201cpunk.\u201d He said that mayors and other public officials who choose not to cooperate in federal immigration-law enforcement efforts should be prosecuted and jailed.

The theme of Kaine\u2019s re-election campaign is \u201ca Virginia that works for all.\u201d  Kaine said that means jobs, education, health care, security and equality for all.   \u201cI\u2019m running again because I want to keep building a Virginia that works for all, and I\u2019m really proud of what Virginia is doing, and I\u2019m inspired by the Virginians I meet every day,\u201d Kaine said in an interview following his remarks at the campaign rally that was attended by roughly 100 people.  At CVCC, Kaine touched upon the need to create jobs in infrastructure and renewable energy.  \u201cI think infrastructure is a huge opportunity because the president wants to do infrastructure,\u201d Kaine said.  He added the U.S. needs to invest in infrastructure rather than start trade wars that \u201ccould potentially hurt American workers,\u201d a swipe at President Donald Trump\u2019s call for tariffs on certain Chinese products.  Kaine also said with infrastructure comes a need for workforce development.  \u201cIf we do infrastructure, there will be a real burden on the shoulders of our educational institutions,\u201d Kaine said, noting career and technical programs will be asked to fill that need.  \u201cThe most important thing to economic development is ultimately the talent of the workforce.\u201d  Nat Marshall, a CVCC Local Board member who introduced Kaine and spoke briefly about workforce development, said schools need to encourage career exploration at the sixth-grade level to open students\u2019 eyes to opportunities in vocational fields they otherwise may overlook as options.  Marshall said CVCC has a place in helping train a workforce to meet the goals Kaine outlined.  \u201cCommunity colleges are the most flexible institutions that can do that,\u201d Marshall said.  In his address to constituents, Kaine also said the U.S. needs to raise the minimum wage over time.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the country should work full time, have a dependent and be below the poverty line,\u201d the senator said, drawing applause from a friendly crowd wearing Kaine 2018 stickers.  Though Kaine\u2019s opening address stuck to his campaign planks, questions from the crowd varied.  Kate Staton, 15, a sophomore at E.C. Glass High School, asked Kaine about gun violence and why it has taken national student walkouts to prompt a dialogue about fatal shootings across the country.  \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t, but I\u2019m so proud of you guys, I really am,\u201d Kaine answered.  He said as a former mayor of Richmond, former governor of Virginia and as a senator, he has called for \u201cmore commonsense rules about gun safety,\u201d pushing for background checks, assault weapons bans, limitations on high-capacity magazines and stricter regulations on purchasing firearms at gun shows.  \u201cMy plea to you is keep doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Kaine told Staton.  He added he has grown despondent over the lack of congressional action to prevent gun violence.  \u201cWe the students simply don\u2019t feel safe going to school,\u201d Staton said in an interview.  She added she appreciated the efforts the senator has made but wants immediate action.  Kaine also fielded a question about cyber threats and malicious companies sharing personal data.  In response, Kaine said the U.S. needs more cybersecurity professionals, and there should be consequences for companies that allow private user data to fall in the hand of malicious actors.  One constituent asked if there was a congressional answer the rise of misinformation and political polarization, noting members of her own family were divided over the Trump presidency.  Kaine said the answer isn\u2019t censoring content but pushing critical thinking in schools.  He added he has major concerns about Trump, saying the president divides Americans rather than uniting them and undercuts diplomacy with his tweets and turnover in the administration.  The senator added he plans to campaign on what he hopes to accomplish in another term, rather than focusing on the issues he has with Trump\u2019s leadership and the Republican Party.  \u201cFundamentally, my campaign is going to be about a Virginia that works for all,\u201d Kaine said.

It was a tough one, and the questioner, a woman with long gray hair, seemed to know it, as she sat awaiting her answer.  Willis, a Special Forces officer in the West Virginia National Guard, now running for Senate as a Republican, may be a novice politician, but he\u2019s savvy enough to know better than to pick sides in a war that ended more than a century ago. He also knows his West Virginia history. The state came into being in the first place by seceding from the Commonwealth of Virginia due to residents\u2019 Union sympathies.  For a second, he appeared to be cornered. He\u2019d studied the opioid crisis, energy policy, immigration, and jobs. Somehow the Civil War hadn\u2019t come up.  But after four months on the trail, Willis, who is good looking and athletic, and wears his graying hair cropped short, has developed a seasoned politician\u2019s knack for slipping out of a trap. \u201cI was born on the right side of the Mason Dixon,\u201d he said with a smile \u2014 offering an answer that left plenty of room for interpretation. (He was born in Virginia.) In other words, a politician\u2019s answer. While his audience pondered his response, Willis quickly dove into his stump speech.  Tom Willis west virginia senate It was a cold, gray day in April, and only a handful of Fayette County Republicans had shown up for what was already Willis\u2019 second campaign speech of the day. As he always did, he touched on the state\u2019s loss of jobs and the opioid crisis. On a personal note, he talked about his own quest to serve, how he lost his first wife to cancer and how his son later survived the disease.  \u201cI understand what it is like to suffer,\u201d he said to nods from the group. \u201cWe have problems, but the problems can be solved if we work together.\u201d  After Willis finished, an older man wearing a maroon Virginia Tech shirt and jeans, his arm in a gray sling, stood up and saluted him. A former Army Ranger, the man wouldn\u2019t let the Civil War question go.  \u201cAre you a good Confederate or a damn Yankee?\u201d  \u201cMartinsville, Virginia, is rebel country,\u201d Willis said. \u201cYou heard of it? We\u2019ve got a speedway.\u201d  The answer brought a smile to the man\u2019s face. Then a nod of the head. A connection made even as Willis once again deftly sidestepped the issue.  Maybe he could win this thing after all\u2026  tom willis west virginia senate Year of the veteran? A career in the military has long been seen as a stepping stone to elective office, but the 2018 midterms are shaping up to be a special moment for veterans storming the political battlespace.  Serving in the military is the \u201csingle best-testing trait\u201d for congressional candidates, and voters from both parties\u2019 view those who served in a positive light, according to a recent poll conducted by a veteran\u2019s super PAC.  With Honor, a \u201ccross-partisan\u201d PAC helping veterans get elected to Congress, surveyed 753 likely voters nationwide, and the results suggest that a background in the armed forces makes candidates like Willis uniquely suited for today\u2019s hyperpartisan political environment. Nearly a third of voters across the political spectrum say they are willing to cross party lines to vote for a veteran. Moreover, former service members are viewed as mission-oriented coalition builders who can work across the aisle.  As Willis is discovering, even a veteran can find it hard to break through, though \u2014 especially in a crowded field. On the Republican side, six candidates have been jockeying for the chance to replace Democrat Joe Manchin, who is running for his second full term. To the extent that the media has taken note of the race, most of the attention has been focused on the campaign of Don Blankenship, the former coal company CEO who recently emerged from a prison stint in connection with the 2010 disaster at a mine he operated that left 29 miners dead.  In a normal election year, a backstory like that would be seen as disqualifying. Not this year. In a recent poll, Blankenship drew 12 percent of likely voters to just 3 percent who picked Willis. Frontrunners State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins came in at 24 percent and 20 percent respectively. With the primary just a week away, however, 39 percent of GOP voters were undecided \u2014 a thin sliver of hope for Willis.  tom Willis west virginia senate Meanwhile, Willis says his own internal polling has him tied for third place with Morrisey. And voters who get to hear about his veteran status seem to be responding. Among them, he wins with 36 percent of the vote, according to internal polling data.  \u201cI just look at it as a military operation to win hearts and minds,\u201d Willis says.  In this respect, it turns out, Willis\u2019s special forces training translates well to the campaign trail. Knowing how to quickly build rapport, forge connections, broker deals and appeal to various constituencies may be as important to any counterinsurgency operation \u2014 arguably more so \u2014 than engaging the enemy. And during a few days Task & Purpose spent embedded on the campaign trail with Willis, it was clear that such skills constituted a secret weapon of sorts.  \u201cNobody in the military can build rapport better,\u201d Willis said of the Special Forces. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do for our country under difficult circumstances. Politics is one handshake at a time.\u201d  That\u2019s not the only way that the campaign trail can sometimes resemble a deployment. The mornings are early. The nights are late. The food is unhealthy. And there remains, whatever comes, a singular focus on the mission.  \u201cThere is work to do,\u201d Willis said over and over again. \u201cPeople are suffering. People are unemployed. To be part of the solution, you have a moral responsibility to step up.\u201d  Tom Willis west virginia senate Veteran. Lawyer. Businessman. Willis\u2019s campaign started in January, two months after he left active duty. He was seven years from retirement, but he said he felt called to elective office.  \u201cThe reason I\u2019m running is to serve God by serving my fellow man,\u201d he told me. \u201cI got to a point in my life where I\u2019m not as young as I used to be. But how can I best serve my fellow man? I can serve better by moving from the physical battle to the ideological battle.\u201d  Meanwhile, although West Virginia has one of the biggest veteran populations in the country, there is currently no veteran serving in its Congressional delegation.  \u201cThat\u2019s an anomaly we plan to correct,\u201d Willis said.  A Special Forces Distinguished Honor Graduate, Willis joined the West Virginia National Guard in 2000, starting out in the enlisted ranks and eventually becoming executive officer of a U.S. Army Special Forces Battalion. He deployed to Afghanistan, Macedonia, Peru and Bahrain. He often served as a liaison, working closely with the Peruvian military on counter-narcotics operations and with the Kuwaiti military fighting ISIS.  Before enlisting, Willis \u2014 a graduate of the University of Virginia and Georgetown Law School \u2014 clerked for a federal judge at the U.S. Tax Court and spent some time working as a tax attorney. Now a real estate developer, he is the co-owner of the Glen Ferris Inn on the banks of the Kanawha River in Fayette County.  Willis has consciously built his campaign less on his policy ideas, which tend to follow the typical conservative program, than on his biography. On his campaign website, his varied roles (\u201cVeteran, Businessman, Father\u201d) are featured prominently, and one has to dig a little to learn his stances on the issues. Interestingly, the Republican party does not appear to be mentioned at all, although Willis does compare himself to President Donald Trump (\u201ca fellow outsider\u201d) and promise to be \u201cthe biggest supporter of the President\u2019s agenda to grow our economy, keep taxes low, and restore law and order to our immigration system.\u201d  He bills himself as a soldier first and foremost, driven to serve by a sense of duty. \u201cYou look around and see things and they\u2019re not right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have some major needs in our country and it is going to take some people with integrity.\u201d  \u2018I think he\u2019ll win\u2019 Willis dresses like a lawyer these days. Dark suit. Vest. Leather shoes. Power tie. Riding in his black Jeep Cherokee one morning, with his campaign manager, Jim Shaffer, riding shotgun, he joked that it was his new uniform.  Tom Willis west virginia senate Headed for their first campaign stop of the day, a senior center near Charleston, the men called campaign workers, drafted talking points and sometimes rode in silence. XM\u2019s Chill satellite radio station \u2014 a \u201crelaxing mix of down-tempo EDM and rock\u201d \u2014 provided the soundtrack as Willis weaved through the hills.  West Virginia is the third poorest state in the union, and its challenges seemed to be etched in its landscape. Riding with Willis between campaign stops, it was impossible to miss the crumbling houses, the potted roads and boarded up storefronts. But just as one began to find West Virginia\u2019s plight overwhelming, the Cherokee rounded a bend and cruised past a massive gorge carved by a majestic river.  Willis is aware of the struggles his state faces. At several stops, he mentioned its \u201cbrain drain,\u201d the tendency of residents to leave in search of better economic opportunities. The state has experienced a population decline for several years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  Despite a pro-labor tradition that goes back decades, the basis for a successful teacher\u2019s strike that concluded in March, West Virginia is undoubtedly Trump country. The President won the state by 42 points in the 2016 election. Willis supports Trump because he says the administration has been good to West Virginia and coal, but his support isn\u2019t unconditional.  \u201cI only gave a blank check to the people of West Virginia when I raised my right hand to join the National Guard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll give the people a blank check as a statesman.\u201d  He\u2019ll oppose any policies that hurt West Virginia, he insisted.  Willis pulled his SUV into the parking lot of the Hometown Senior Center,  a squat white building near some railroad tracks, shortly before the day\u2019s event was set to begin \u2014 a forum where local voters could meet candidates for local, state and national office. Inside, it resembled a living room adorned with a fireplace and red, white and blue decorations. Several round tables had been set up in the dining area. The smell of chicken-fried steak, mashed potatoes and green beans wafted into the room from the kitchen.  Tom Willis west virginia senate Two of Willis\u2019 opponents and a few Congressional hopefuls had shown up, as well as some down-ballot candidates. As for voters, they were outnumbered by political hopefuls two to one. The host began with a request to keep speeches to five minutes and to refrain from negative comments about political rivals.  Candidates for the U.S. Senate race were up first. Copley, a bald man with a neatly trimmed beard, took the floor. He is best known for the viral video of him challenging Hillary Clinton about coal jobs at a roundtable during the 2016 presidential campaign, and he used his time to tell that story, ending with an appeal for support.  \u201cI\u2019m not a politician,\u201d Copley emphasized. \u201cI\u2019m a West Virginian.\u201d  Meanwhile, Willis was observing the room. He picked out an African-American woman and an older man in the back as the influencers to focus on when the time came. He started his speech talking about how the partners at Baker & McKenzie, the major law firm he\u2019d worked at, reacted to his choice to join the West Virginia National Guard. His colleagues didn\u2019t understand why he wanted to forgo a career as a tax attorney to try and earn the Special Forces tab, he said, and only one seemed to share the need to serve something bigger than themselves.  The audience watched him closely, fixing their eyes on his smile and hands, which weaved through the air like an orchestra conductor\u2019s.  Tom Willis west virginia senate Willis\u2019s speech focused mostly on his service overseas, with a special emphasis on fighting ISIS, the Taliban and narco-terrorists. But to those gathered in the center, the wars felt far away. Willis knew it. So, he ended his by talking about with the Glen Ferris Inn, his historic hotel, and a state landmark.  \u201cMaybe some of you guys have come in and tried our peanut butter pie?\u201d Willis asked, eliciting nods from the sparse crowd and bringing home his local bona fides.  With only a minutes left, Willis hit the issues, letting voters know he was pro-life and pro-Second Amendment, and pledging to keep the promise of Social Security and Medicare.  \u201cMy name is Tom Willis and I hope you vote for me on May 8,\u201d he said before taking a seat.  Navy veteran turned truck driver Jack Newbrough was next.  Instead of a suit jacket, Newbrough sported a sweatshirt, along with work boots, a USS West Virginia baseball cap and a concealed sidearm, which he showed the audience mid-speech while talking about how he personified the Second Amendment. Ignoring the ground rules, he immediately launched into an attack on Morissey, the front-runner.  Outside after his speech, Newbrough smoked while he waited for the candidates in the state races to finish. He knew his chances to win were slim, but he relished the spoiler role. He was determined to keep Morrisey out of office.  \u201cI think Tom is going to win,\u201d Newbrough said between drags. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s common sense. He\u2019s like me. He says it like it is.\u201d  Inside, lunch was served. Willis had another campaign stop, but before ducking out, he made a point to meet with the two influencers in the room. A handshake. A smile.  Schaffer hung back, his eyes on his cell phone. The campaign was waiting for confirmation on several endorsements from national veteran PACs. Willis would get six.  \u201cTom is genuine,\u201d Shaffer, a veteran of several statewide campaigns, told me when asked why he\u2019d signed up with Willis. \u201cNo slickness. No political speak.\u201d  On the way to the next stop, Willis got a call from his wife, Sara. She was excited to tell him about a volunteer who has flooded the eastern panhandle of the state with campaign signs.  \u201cEverywhere they turned there was a sign for you,\u201d she said excitedly on speakerphone.  Willis, in the passenger seat, smiled. His shoulders relaxed.  \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the impact one dedicated volunteer can make,\u201d he said.  Tom Willis west virginia senate A longshot It was impossible to miss the 293-foot gold dome of West Virginia\u2019s State Capitol as Willis cruised downtown looking for a local TV station.  It was Tuesday, and his day is packed with interviews, a ribbon cutting for the opening of his second campaign office at the Glen Ferris Inn, and the announcement of his jobs program.  The TV interview would be with Mark Curtis, host of \u201cInside West Virginia Politics.\u201d Willis was upbeat. \u201cI think it is going to come down to a couple hundred votes,\u201d he was saying. \u201c30,000 votes probably wins the race.\u201d The career politicians are fading, he added. \u201cI\u2019m the only one moving up fast. Morrisey is falling fast, and the two leaders have plateaued. If I had four more months, I\u2019d win by ten points.\u201d  Curtis, a veteran political reporter, met Willis at the station\u2019s door. In the studio, the show\u2019s graphic filled the monitor behind the small stage. As they waited for the signal to begin, Curtis went over the format.  \u201cI don\u2019t do interviews,\u201d he said. \u201cI do conversations.\u201d  He paused before they started recording.  \u201cThis is a chance for you to introduce yourself to a lot of people who don\u2019t know who you are,\u201d Curtis said.  The five-minute interview went by fast. Willis looked relaxed, at ease in front of the cameras. It\u2019s a skill he was still mastering. He used to look down while he thought of an answer, he\u2019d admitted, breaking eye contact with the interviewer and appearing unsure. Tuesday, Willis beamed at Curtis and the cameras.  \u201cYou impressed a lot of people at the debate,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cWhy run for Senate?\u201d  It\u2019s a question Willis gets a lot. To the political elite, Willis was cutting the line by skipping a run for state office and going for a Senate seat. But he wasn\u2019t sure how much good he could do in the state legislature or on a school board.  \u201cThis is the one I\u2019m best qualified for,\u201d he told Curtis. \u201cThere is no other candidate in West Virginia that has the legal pedigree, the national security pedigree.\u201d  Curtis has covered the race from the start. \u201cThe more people hear him, the more people like him,\u201d Curtis told Task & Purpose. \u201cHe has enough time to be a factor.\u201d  Curtis said Willis fits the trend of political novices willing to reject political norms and run on their own terms. \u201cPeople dislike politicians,\u201d he explained. \u201cPeople like a longshot.\u201d  Even as the polls have Willis gaining only single digit support \u2014 not even enough to qualify for a recent Fox News debate \u2014 he still predicts victory on May 8.  \u201cRemember Trump lost badly in all the polls too,\u201d Willis said with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the polls for a minute. It\u2019s going to be a photo finish.\u201d","articles_date":"3 5 2018","articles_link":"https:\/\/taskandpurpose.com\/tom-willis-west-virginia-senate\/","articles_title":"The Operator: A Green Beret Turned Senate Candidate Wages An \u2018Ideological\u2019 Battle On The Homefront","candidate_fk":8,"first_name":"Tom","id":437,"issue":3,"last_name":"Willis","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"HUNTINGTON - Several recent polls show three of the six Republicans running for a West Virginia seat in the U.S. Senate locked in a competitive race to win their party's nomination in the May 8 primary election.  West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and former coal baron Don Blankenship appear to be running in a tight three-way primary, while the three other candidates - Tom Willis, Jack Newbrough and Bo Copley - are trailing the top three with single-digit poll numbers.  With the popularity of President Donald Trump in West Virginia, the Republican Party thinks it can pick up a seat in the Senate currently being occupied by Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin, who is seeking re-election in the Democratic primary on May 8. Manchin faces Paula Jean Swearengin in the Democratic race.  Here is a look at the six Republican candidates and their views:  Patrick Morrisey  Morrisey says as West Virginia attorney general, he has worked tirelessly to defend conservative West Virginia values, including defending life; expanding gun rights; suing President Barack Obama's EPA and protecting coal; suing Obama over Obamacare and his illegal amnesty program; and finally, aggressively tackling the opioid tragedy in West Virginia.  \"Now, I'm running for Senate to continue this fight and protect West Virginia from the liberals in Washington,\" he said. \"I have worked with President Trump as attorney general to protect our West Virginia conservative values, and I look forward to standing with President Trump as West Virginia's next U.S. senator.\"  Morrisey says he is the only candidate in this race with a proven conservative record of accomplishing results for West Virginia.  Morrisey wants voters to carefully examine each candidate's past.  \"I believe the best way to look at whether a candidate will fight for the issues that are important to voters is to look at what the candidate has done in the past,\" he said. \"My record of conservative results for West Virginia is clear. Time and again, I have stood with President Trump and against President Obama in defense of West Virginia. Unfortunately, my opponents in this primary do not share my record of conservative results.\"  Morrisey said if elected, his priorities would be twofold.  \"First, we need to do everything in our power to bring good-paying jobs back to West Virginia, and that starts with getting rid of the regulatory red tape in Washington,\" he said. \"As attorney general, I was able to make some headway on this issue by suing President Obama, but there is still more to be done. Now that President Trump is in the White House, we have an opportunity to rejuvenate our economy.  \"Second, I will continue to focus on tackling the opioid crisis on a holistic basis. Recently, I sued the DEA, which will result in a dramatically reduced opioid supply nationwide. Unfortunately, the very people in Washington who were supposed to protect us from a deluge of pain pills have been asleep at the switch. It's critical that we hold these people accountable and demand action.\"  Morrisey, of Harpers Ferry in Jefferson County, is West Virginia's first Republican attorney general since 1933. He was elected in 2012 and re-elected in 2016 and says he is a conservative champion for Mountain State families and taxpayers.  Evan Jenkins  Jenkins, of Huntington, says his platform is also consistent with President Trump. He claims he is the only candidate in the Republican field who supported Trump from the beginning.  \"I am a West Virginia conservative who is working with President Trump each and every day for our shared conservative values,\" he said. \"My beliefs and principles are resolute. I believe that our constitutional rights cannot be restricted.\"  Jenkins said his record is 100 percent pro-life and 100 percent in favor of the Second Amendment.  \"I have a perfect rating from the NRA and am proud of it. I have fought tooth and nail to defend our constitutional rights and the Second Amendment and will continue to do so as your senator,\" he said. \"My commitment to the sanctity of human life has never, and will never, waver. With a 100 percent pro-life voting record in Congress, I have always stood on the side of life. In the U.S. Senate, I will remain a champion for the unborn.\"  Jenkins says if elected that he would focus on creating jobs, which he believes solves a lot of problems.  \"The Obama administration's policies have devastated our state and led directly to the loss of good-paying West Virginia jobs,\" Jenkins said. \"I believe that a good job solves a lot of problems, and getting people back to work is critical to ending the opioid crisis that has destroyed too many lives. I'm focused on bringing a pro-jobs agenda to Washington, one that will provide certainty to West Virginia businesses and create jobs for the hardworking families in our state. And I will stand up to the Washington liberals to protect our God-given rights.\"  Don Blankenship  Blankenship, of Sprigg in Mingo County, says he is running on a platform that is very much in line with Trump.  \"Regulations have cost us our economy and, to a great extent, our quality of life,\" he said. \"We also need to stop illegal immigration and build the wall. This is very much in line with President Trump.\"  Blankenship said he is an anti-establishment candidate and is not a career politician. He says he wants to tackle federal government waste, create jobs, support coal, help stop the opioid epidemic and close the borders.  \"I am socially very conservative on abortion and a strong believer on the First and Second Amendments,\" he said. \"I have more experience by far than any other candidate in dealing with the government from the outside. The other candidates are very much establishment and government guys.\"  Blankenship says he is also the only candidate that has created jobs.  He is the former CEO of Massey Energy. He was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of conspiring to willfully violate safety standards in relation to the Upper Big Branch mine explosion that killed 29 people. He served a year in prison, all the while saying he was innocent.  Tom Willis  Tom Willis, of Hedgesville in Berkeley County, says West Virginia needs strong representation in Washington.  \"We need good jobs and support for small business,\" he said. \"We need someone actively protecting our Second Amendment rights, and we need someone who will promote West Virginian family values, to include protecting the unborn, standing up for us in Washington.\"  Willis says he is the only candidate in the race who is a veteran and says he is a \"non-politician.\"  \"I'm a combat veteran, an officer in the West Virginia National Guard and a Green Beret honor graduate,\" he said. \"As a tax attorney, I also understand how complex the tax codes are and how they stifle business growth and entrepreneurship. I'm a business owner, husband, father and a man of faith. My real world experiences, training, expertise and beliefs make me the most qualified and best candidate running.\"  Willis said one priority for him, if elected, would be to address the opioid epidemic.  \"West Virginia has one of the worst opioid drug addiction problems in the country but hasn't seen federal funding to match,\" he said. \"We need to be open to giving people second chances, including alternative sentencing, and be open to working in cooperation with faith-based recovery programs that statistically reduce recidivism rates. We must address the hopelessness at the root of the problem and deal with it with compassion.\"  Bo Copley  Bo Copley, of Delbarton in Mingo County, says after working for 11 years in the mining industry he was abruptly laid off in September 2015.  In May 2016, Copley was seated at a roundtable discussion with Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., where he confronted Clinton on her words of \"putting coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"  Subsequent to the 2016 presidential race, Copley was named one of 16 people who influenced the 2016 election by Yahoo News.  Copley says he is running as a constitutional conservative who, as a U.S. senator, will introduce and promote legislation that will protect unborn children, foster job growth and promote the well-being of all West Virginians.  \"I am a West Virginian, not a politician,\" he said. \"I am not using this race as a stepping stone to higher office, and am running because I believe Washington needs more middle-class Americans in office who can relate to the struggles West Virginians face every day.\"  Copley says he would breathe fresh life into a U.S. Senate that is currently dominated and controlled by special interest groups and career politicians.  \"I am both a lifelong Republican and West Virginian, which cannot be said by some of the other candidates,\" he said. \"I have worked in the private sector my entire life.\"  Copley says he is against abortion in any form.  \"As a devout Christian and father of three beautiful children, I cannot one day meet my maker and say that I support abortion in any form,\" he said. \"I oppose abortion in all shapes, forms and sizes and believe that life begins at conception. I will fight each and every day to protect the unborn.\"  Copley said his priorities, if elected, would also include jobs, energy and education.  \"The key to a strong economy is a citizenry that is employed,\" he said. \"In order for West Virginians and Americans across the U.S. to find good-paying jobs that can support families, we must make it easier for businesses to operate. High tax rates are devastating to businesses and individuals, and America needs to cut its frivolous spending as well as its tax rates.  \"I pledge to work tirelessly to defend West Virginia's interests from Washington bureaucrats and to promote coal, oil and gas as the common-sense solutions to America's energy needs.\"  Jack Newbrough  Jack Newbrough, of Weirton in Brooke and Hancock counties, says he is running on a \"veterans first and foremost\" platform, along with doing something about the opioid crisis in West Virginia.  \"I'm a U.S. Navy veteran and an over-the-road truck driver,\" he said. \"I'm a native West Virginian, born and raised.\"  Newbrough calls himself the \"blue collar candidate.\"  \"I drive semis for a living and make about $45,000 a year,\" he said. \"I am just like most West Virginians who are benefiting from President Trump's tax cuts. I see all issues with illegal immigration and infrastructure every day.\"  Newbrough says if elected, his priorities would be to fix the VA and tackle the opioid crisis head-on.  \"Everything that is happening in West Virginia has affected me personally,\" he said. \"My son's mother lost her life to opioid addiction about 10 years ago. With her taking opioids while being pregnant has caused my son to suffer from ADHD and autism.\"  Newbrough says he has taken no donations from anyone or accepted donations from special interest groups like his opponents.  \"I would love to prove a point that you don't need to raise millions to win an election,\" he said.","articles_date":"1 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.williamsondailynews.com\/news\/six-republican-candidates-running-for-us-senate-in-west-virginia\/article_4d6a2e62-af4e-53e9-a6af-42c2c415f31d.html","articles_title":"Six Republican candidates running for US Senate in West Virginia","candidate_fk":8,"first_name":"Tom","id":438,"issue":3,"last_name":"Willis","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"When former Green Beret Tom Willis decided to venture into politics, he didn\u2019t tiptoe.  He surged.  Willis, co-owner of the historic Glen Ferris Inn in Fayette County, a tax attorney and a National Guardsman, blew past the state level races and a shot at the Republican congressional seat in the GOP primaries.  Instead, Willis set his sights on the same prize Rep. Evan Jenkins wants \u2014 Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s seat in the United States Senate.  It was inevitable that he\u2019d want to go after a Senate seat, he told The Register-Herald.  \u201cThe simple answer is because I\u2019m going to win,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I can.  \u201cI\u2019m the best guy to beat Joe Manchin.\u201d  Pointing out that he\u2019s a veteran and West Virginia business owner, Willis said has spent much of his adult life in 20 countries on several continents as a Green Beret and second in command of a U.S. Army Special Forces Battalion. He also speaks four languages.  \u201cI think internationally and nationally ... What good is that going to do me, as a delegate from Berkeley County?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe job I can do, better than anybody else, especially Manchin, is U.S. Senator.\u201d  Willis\u2019 battlefield for the GOP primary is tough and includes not only Jenkins, who recently accepted an endorsement from President Donald Trump, but also coal baron and longtime Manchin foe Don Blankenship, and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Brooklyn native and former Washington lobbyist.  He said he decided to enter the political realm because the state needs help. He noted that West Virginia has the highest number of veterans per capita, but has no veterans serving the state\u2019s interests on the national level in this district.  He said a commanding officer once stopped to pick up trash from a parking lot and told Willis that if he\u2019s out and notices trash, he shouldn\u2019t walk past it.  \u201cWe\u2019re last in everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of people suffering in our state.  \u201cThere are some ideologies creeping in that are dangerous to the American dream,\u201d he added. \u201cI can\u2019t walk by that trash.  \u201cI know I can be part of the solution. Somebody\u2019s got to stand and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got problems, but with leadership we can find solutions.\u2019  \u201cIt\u2019s just a call to service. It really just boils down to duty and honor and a call to service. You have a moral obligation, if you see a problem, and I know I can lead.\u201d  He supports Trump\u2019s environmental policies that allow for fewer restrictions on coal production.  His economic vision for the state, however, is detailed \u2014 creating 15,000 jobs over the next six years \u2014 and depends heavily on small business development. A long-term goal is to wean the state from subsidies, he said.  \u201cThe path forward for West Virginia is small business,\u201d Willis said. \u201cEighty percent of all new jobs are created through small business.  \u201cOur state economic development department is trying to bring in the Proctors and Gambles, like we\u2019ve got in the Eastern Panhandle.  \u201cBut if we\u2019re really going to change the state, it\u2019s going to come from small business.\u201d  He said his goal is to bring in a pool of candidates who are interested in starting a business, particularly in select sectors, and to offer access to more than 9,000 online free or low-cost training programs via a partnership with a non-profit organization.  \u201cQualify them,\u201d he said. \u201cProvide them know-how or business plans. Then you find them capital.  \u201cA senator can get access to capital. We can build Gatlinburg (Tenn.) right here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a small example.\u201d  Willis offered his positions on the issues:  President Trump: \u201cPeople ask, do you support our president? I say, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t give anybody a blank check. He\u2019s our commander-in-chief. We should support him. We should pray for him. That\u2019s what we\u2019re told to do. On the economy, I support him 100 percent.\u201d  He joked that Trump\u2019s \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d to date was failing to endorse him. He said that Trump has had \u201cunprecedented attacks\u201d by 95 percent of the media.  \u201cThe Wall\u201d: Willis said he supports construction of the wall between Mexico and the United States for security purposes. He said an unchecked border allows human traffickers and drug dealers to enter, along with terrorists from foreign countries.  Tax reform: Willis is in favor of a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget.  \u201cI think one of the greatest threats to our national security is our national debt,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to many countries, and they have a fancy plane they bought, fancy weapon systems, but, literally, I talk to the pilots, they don\u2019t have the gas to fly it. They can\u2019t afford the gas, or they can\u2019t afford the bullets.  \u201cOur national debt is a national security risk because it takes money to fund the military.\u201d  Health care: Willis, whose son is a bone cancer survivor, believes that the health care market is a \u201cprivate sector realm.\u201d To provide more coverage, he proposes allowing insurance companies to operate across state lines and to reduce administrative costs in health care by limiting the amount of damages patients can seek against hospitals.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got 200,000 newly dependent on the federal government now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost that dignity. They\u2019ve lost that freedom. They\u2019re dependent on others for their provisions.\u201d  He said those who can\u2019t get insured in the private sector due to pre-existing conditions should be protected in some way by government, possibly through subsidized premiums purchased on the private market.  \u201cWe need to pull them out of the (privately insured) population,\u201d he said. \u201cThat reduces costs for insurance companies, so they\u2019re dealing with a predominantly healthy population.\u201d  Veterans\u2019 health care: \u201cI believe the veterans have earned the right to choose, so the veterans should have the choice,\u201d eh said. \u201cYounger veterans prefer private providers.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got the VA Choice program that\u2019s working right now,\u201d he added. \u201cThe problem with the VA Choice is that it\u2019s run by the VA.\u201d  Reproductive rights: Willis said he believes life is sacred and begins at conception. He would support measures making abortion illegal.  When asked if women who have illegal abortions would be charged with murder or another crime, he did not answer but said he favored avenues of making adoption easier.

Joe Manchin in a potential face-off  \u201cI look at where we are in the rankings as a state with West Virginia and I look at what the career politicians are doing in D.C., and frankly I\u2019m not satisfied with either and I don\u2019t think our fellow West Virginians are either,\u201d the National Guard major said on the Jan. 25 program.  More than two months later, Willis said momentum is on his side, pointing to the April 3 Republican candidate debate in Martinsburg in which U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship also participated.  \u201cI do think as the voters of West Virginia were looking at the four of us on the stage and saying who is the most senatorial or who do I want to represent me as the next U.S. senator for West Virginia, I think that they were looking at Tom Willis,\u201d he said in an interview last week.  Willis said he offers voters a candidate with solid conservative principals and diverse experience; in addition to his military service, the Hedgesville resident also is the co-owner of the Glen Ferris Inn in Fayette County and previously was a tax attorney in Washington, D.C. His resume has caught the attention of news outlets based outside of West Virginia, such as CNN and Fox Business Network.  \u201cWhen news stations are looking for credible authorities to comment on whatever topic, really my resume fits any bill,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an easy fit.\u201d  During the debate, Willis said he was anti-abortion, against gun control policies and a proponent of stricter immigration policies, which he said last week Congress has failed to act upon.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t fund the wall, we couldn\u2019t come to a deal on the immigration debate and we still have weak enforcement laws. All of these send a signal that the border\u2019s open,\u201d he said.  The omnibus spending bill passed in March includes $1.5 billion for infrastructure on the U.S.-Mexico border, including physical barriers and \u201cassociated technology.\u201d According to a memo from House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., the funding would cover construction for more than 90 miles of a border wall.  With Republicans passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, Willis said immigration and national security are the two issues President Donald Trump will likely make a top priority after the general election.  \u201cIt really helps to have a veteran voice to be heard on those issues because I\u2019ve worked with U.S. Southern Command, I\u2019ve worked in South America and I have years of professional experience in a military uniform fighting against terrorist organizations, drug organizations, terrorist crime organizations that were specifically targeting our country through the southern border,\u201d he said.  According to the American Immigration Council, fewer than 5,000 people living in West Virginia illegally. The U.S. Census Bureau reports 1.6 percent of the state\u2019s 1.8 million residents are immigrants.  \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that\u2019s obviously beyond our borders here in West Virginia,\u201d Willis said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a U.S. Senate seat, so we have to send people that see a bigger picture of not only what\u2019s good for West Virginia but for our nation.\u201d  With the May 8 primary approaching, Willis said he is confident in his chances, noting a growth in interest in his candidacy following the Martinsburg debate.  \u201cAs soon as people find out that I\u2019m a veteran and that I\u2019m a Senate candidate, we win by a two-to-one margin over the other candidates,\u201d Willis said of his campaign\u2019s internal poll numbers.  \u201cWest Virginia has the highest percentage of veterans in the country, but zero veterans in our U.S. congressional delegation. And that just doesn\u2019t make sense, and I think West Virginians get that.\u201d  The increase in attention also includes from non-Republicans; West Virginia Democratic Party Chairwoman Belinda Biafore criticized Jenkins, Morrisey and Blankenship after the debate, but said Willis \u201cseems like a very nice man.\u201d  \u201cLooking beyond (the primary), I think we need a candidate that can appeal to the broader spectrum of West Virginians as a whole because that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to beat Joe Manchin,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s further evidence that I\u2019m the best choice.\u201d","articles_date":"16 4 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/wvmetronews.com\/2018\/04\/16\/willis-momentum-growing-as-primary-draws-closer\/","articles_title":"Willis: Momentum growing as primary draws closer","candidate_fk":8,"first_name":"Tom","id":440,"issue":5,"last_name":"Willis","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"For those of you concerned about whether Russians and other bad actors around the globe are trying to subvert our nation\u2019s democracy and set us against one another by interfering in our electoral process (they are, by the way), here\u2019s your chance to fire back: Go vote. That\u2019s what patriots do.  Apathy is the weapon of those who oppose us and our institutions of freedom. Enemies of our republic want us to care less, to leave decisions to someone else, to acquiesce, to take what comes. They want us to believe that a single vote does not matter.  Well, it does, especially in races where vote totals will be in the hundreds, not hundreds of thousands. There are a good many school board races on the ballot this spring \u2013 and for those candidates, this is not a primary but the real deal.  Likewise, there are many races for the state House of Delegates and state Senate where a single vote could carry the day for some fortunate candidate.  You can also do the math and come to a realization that one vote per precinct could make a world of difference in a race for Congress \u2013 for either the U.S. Senate or the Congressional 3rd District \u2013 especially if there are more than just a couple of candidates running for office, as there are in both of these contests.  So, yes, your vote can make a difference, but only if you exercise your right as guaranteed by our nation\u2019s constitution.  The other piece of business you will need to attend to is finding a candidate who is worthy of your support \u2013 and you just may have to look beyond the canned goods.  While we are not endorsing any candidate in any race for the primaries (we will in the fall for the general election), there are quality candidates on both sides of the political aisle.  And, if you are like us, more than a bit disappointed with those candidates who seem to be favored heading toward the wire, we would encourage you to consider candidates who may be just off the radar.  For instance, Tom Willis \u2013 a candidate for U.S. Senate and a conservative\u2019s conservative \u2013 seems like the kind of fresh face who is unsullied by Big Pharma or the political donor class. If you are a Republican and would like a candidate who has boots-on-the-ground military knowledge of foreign affairs, if you are looking for someone who knows first-hand the challenges of running a business that caters to tourists here in West Virginia, well, maybe he\u2019s your guy.  Likewise in the race for Congress out of the 3rd District, again on the Republican side of the ledger, Dr. Ayne Amjad has impeccable credentials \u2013 as a person and a professional. A Beckley native who was educated in both private and public schools and received a Masters degree in Public Health ahead of her Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) at Marshall University, Amjad seems to be the kind of collaborator, consensus builder and thinker that is needed in D.C. to attend to the people\u2019s business. You want to solve the opioid crisis? Who better, a politician or a doctor who has been on the front lines? You want to shake things up and drain the swamp? How about electing a person of high character, steeped in integrity, who is as honest as the day is long.  Again, these are not endorsements but only an acknowledgement that citizens do have options beyond the obvious, beyond incumbents, beyond the same-old, same-old. There are other fine candidates on the ballot.  And for those who have yet to cast a ballot, you can bone up with a little research at various online sites \u2013 including register-herald.com.  Go ahead, get cracking. Do a little homework. And then head to the polls on Tuesday. It\u2019ll really tick off some Russian bot and make you feel proud to be an American \u2013 exercising a freedom so many have died to protect.  Be a patriot. Vote.","articles_date":"6 5 2018","articles_link":"http:\/\/www.register-herald.com\/opinion\/editorials\/study-up-and-go-vote-options-exist\/article_dc8e8e0b-9e7a-51fd-ad93-d4b51fc8d6be.html","articles_title":"Study up and go vote; options exist","candidate_fk":8,"first_name":"Tom","id":441,"issue":7,"last_name":"Willis","newspaper_name":"Other","source_fk":4,"state_fk":1},{"article_text":"Morrisey receives endorsement from Family Policy Council  HARPERS FERRY, W.Va. - Republican U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey has received the endorsement of the Family Policy Council of West Virginia, an organization allied with the Family Research Council, a socially conservative organization.

Willis noted only around 20 percent of current members of Congress have served in the military.  No one currently representing West Virginia at the federal level has served, he said, adding the state has the highest percentage of residents who are veterans compared to the rest of the country.
