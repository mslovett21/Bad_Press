State laws (and the laws of Washington, D.C. and the U.S. territories) vary considerably, and are independent of existing federal firearms laws, although they are sometimes broader or more limited in scope than the federal laws. State level laws vary significantly in their form, content, and level of restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.\", \"https://cdn.cltampa.com/files/base/scomm/cltampa/image/2018/03/640w/gun_law.5aa311dbc246a.jpg\"],\n",

Research, with few exceptions, finds that immigration on average has positive economic effects on the native population, but is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives. Studies show that the elimination of barriers to migration would have profound effects on world GDP, with estimates of gains ranging between 67 and 147 percent. Development economists argue that reducing barriers to labor mobility between developing countries and developed countries would be one of the most efficient tools of poverty reduction.\" ,\"http://toledocitypaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/immigrants-toledo-refugees-protest.jpg\"],\n",

The approaches are strategically employed to interact with other countries. The study of such strategies is called foreign policy analysis. In recent times, due to the deepening level of globalization and transnational activities, the states will also have to interact with non-state actors. The aforementioned interaction is evaluated and monitored in attempts to maximize benefits of multilateral international cooperation. Since the national interests are paramount, foreign policies are designed by the government through high-level decision making processes. National interests accomplishment can occur as a result of peaceful cooperation with other nations, or through exploitation. Usually, creating foreign policy is the job of the head of government and the foreign minister (or equivalent).\", \"https://bacon.house.gov/sites/bacon.house.gov/files/styles/congress_featured_image/public/featured_image/issues/Foreign%20Policy.png?itok=UVYCCIOO\"],\n",

Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain. Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor, and capital. It has changed over time due to technology (automation, accelerator of process, reduction of cost functions), innovation (new products, services, processes, new markets, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) such as, that which produces intellectual property and changes in industrial relations (for example, child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education).\", \"http://media.al.com/news_impact/photo/economy-2014jpg-886912a5cd9c9100.jpg\"],\n",

       "\"The former prosecutor against ex-coal company chief Don Blankenship expects him to serve his full, one-year sentence in a minimum-security federal prison. ADVERTISEMENT Former U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin made the comments Thursday. Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Ruby confirmed that time off for good behavior applies only to terms more than a year. On Wednesday, Blankenship was sentenced to the maximum penalties of a year in prison and a $250,000 fine for conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards at Upper Big Branch Mine. The southern West Virginia coal mine exploded in 2010, killing 29 men. A jury convicted him of the misdemeanor on Dec. 3. Judge Irene Berger declined to let Blankenship stay free on a $1 million bond while he appeals the case. Goodwin left office after Blankenship's conviction to run for governor.\""

Since then, Democrats have watched as President Donald Trump has risen to power in part by relying on the Republican base -- emphasizing issues like curbing immigration, limiting LGBT rights and more that energize that base and keep the party's congressional leaders on board with his agenda, even when those issues are unpopular with the broader electorate.\n"

       "[' (CNN) Sen. Jeff Sessions took a step closer to becoming the nation\\'s top law enforcement officer when the Senate voted Tuesday to advance his nomination for attorney general to a final vote.  The 52-47-1 vote was mostly along party lines. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin voted with the Republicans and Sessions was the one member to abstain.  A final vote to confirm the  Alabama Republican is expected Wednesday.  Sessions has drawn fire from Democrats who say his steadfast support of President Donald Trump\\'s candidacy raises questions about whether he will be an independent attorney general. Those critics say that independence is critical after Trump fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates last month when she refused to support the President\\'s immigration executive order and repeatedly criticized federal judges. \"That\\'s going to be a real test in this administration because there seems to little regard for an independent judiciary — even for the Constitution itself,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York. \"He would be wrong at any time because of his record on immigration, civil rights and voting rights, but particularly wrong now because we need someone who has some degree of independence from the President.\" But Republican senators have stood by their colleague, who is popular in the chamber for his gracious southern style and his dogged determination in supporting the issues he cares about.  \"We all know Sen. Sessions to be a man of his word. We know he\\'s a man who believes in the rule of law. We know him as someone who is willing to work with anyone, regardless of party — like when he teamed up on legislation with Democratic colleagues like Sen. (Dick) Durbin and ... our late colleague, Ted Kennedy,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, in a floor speech urging the end of a Democratic filibuster against Sessions. ',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said his party should not replicate how Republicans treated Merrick Garland when former President Barack Obama nominated him to fill a vacant seat on the Supreme Court.  Republican lawmakers refused to have confirmation hearings on the Appeals Court judge to consider voting for him. \"That was wrong. That was disgraceful,\" the West Virginia Democrat told CNN\\'s Chris Cuomo Wednesday on \"New Day.\" \"Now (Democrats) think, \\'Okay, that\\'s how we were treated, so we\\'re going to treat them the same.\\'\" \"That\\'s not what we were sent here to do. That\\'s not what I\\'m going to do,\" Manchin added. \"I\\'m anxious to sit down with the new nominee to find out more about him.\" Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to that seat Tuesday, so confident that he\\'d be approved that he called him \"an absolute home run.\" Because Senate rules require 60-votes for any Supreme Court nominee, some Democrats will have to back Gorsuch for him to be approved.  Manchin is known for his willingness to work with Republicans on more conservative issues like abortion and gun ownership. The West Virginia senator said for the Supreme Court to function as designed, lawmakers must prioritize filling the seat left vacant following Justice Antonin Scalia\\'s death last year.  \"If you want the third branch of government to work, then you\\'ve got to have a nine-member Supreme Court, so if Republicans did something and now Democrats are going to do something, two wrongs don\\'t make a right,\" he said. ',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Within minutes of President Donald Trump\\'s selection of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, Democrats who will lead the fight in the Senate delivered scathing assessments -- but held fire on perhaps the most important question facing them: whether they will filibuster the nomination. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer immediately said he had \"serious doubts\" about Gorsuch and hinted at a Democratic filibuster, saying the nominee would need to the support of 60 senators to be confirmed, but stopped short of committing to the tactic.  \"Make no mistake, Senate Democrats will not simply allow but require an exhaustive, robust, and comprehensive debate on Judge Gorsuch\\'s fitness to be a Supreme Court Justice,\" Schumer said Tuesday night. On the surface, Senate Democrats stuck to a firm but somewhat noncommittal message that hinted at the behind-the-scenes debate at the Capitol over whether Democrats will filibuster.  If they choose to hold up his nomination unless he can win 60 votes, Democrats risk spurring Republicans to use the \"nuclear option\" to rewrite the rules to only require 51 votes for confirmation. Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate, meaning they would still need to find the support of eight Democrats without the nuclear option.  It\\'s possible moderate Democrats facing tough re-election battles could be plucked away by Republicans to support Gorsuch. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, and Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, issued muted statements Tuesday night.  \"I look forward to meeting with Judge Gorsuch, examining his record, and making a determination of whether to provide my consent. Just as I have all along, I urge my colleagues to put partisan politics aside and allow the vetting process to proceed,\" Manchin said.  And Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who votes with Democrats, hesitated to go after Gorsuch, saying he wants the nominee to go through a thorough vetting before making a decision. Democrats, meanwhile, are already facing intense pressure from a liberal base fired up after Trump\\'s inauguration, the immigration ban and a perception that some senators, including Schumer, have been soft on Trump\\'s Cabinet picks. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, a veteran liberal from San Francisco, laid out her opposition in stark terms at a CNN town hall Tuesday night.  RELATED: Neil Gorsuch: Scalia\\'s true heir? \"If you breathe air, drink water or eat food, take medicine or in any other way interact with the courts, this is a very bad decision -- well outside the mainstream of American legal thought,\" Pelosi said.  Top Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who will spend the coming months vetting (and potentially blocking) Gorsuch announced \"deep concerns\" with his selection.  \"I have deep, serious concerns about Judge Gorsuch,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. \"An extreme ideologue on the court will threaten privacy rights including women\\'s health care, worker and consumer protections, and public health and safety.\" And Sen. Patrick Leahy, the former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who shepherded President Barack Obama\\'s two nominees on to the high court, sought to hang Trump\\'s immigration ban around Gorsuch\\'s neck immediately. \"In light of the unconstitutional actions of our new President in just his first week, the Senate owes the American people a thorough and unsparing examination of this nomination,\" Leahy said. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz hinted at the idea of cracking open the \"nuclear option\" if Democrats when asked how Republicans should respond to a filibuster. \"The Democrats will not succeed in filibustering Judge Gorsuch,\" Cruz told CNN\\'s Jim Acosta.

       " 'A former coal company executive pleaded guilty Thursday and identified his old boss as part of an effort to cover up safety violations before the worst U.S. mine disaster in decades. David Hughart, who was president of a Massey Energy subsidiary, pleaded guilty to two conspiracy counts before a federal judge in Beckley, West Virginia. He\\'s the highest-ranking official to admit wrongdoing in the investigation that followed the 2010 explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia, which killed 29 workers. The 53-year-old Hughart has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in the ongoing probe stemming from the disaster, the worst American mining catastrophe since 1972, according to his plea agreement. Asked during his plea hearing who he conspired with above him, Hughart replied, \"The chief executive officer,\" CNN affilliate  WCHS  reported.  Massey\\'s former CEO, Don Blankenship, was an outspoken critic of federal mine regulators, but Hughart did not name him directly. In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, Blankenship attorney William Taylor III said Blankenship \"did not conspire with anybody to do anything illegal or improper.\" \"To the contrary, Don took every step to make the mines under his responsibility safer,\" Taylor said. \"We are not concerned about Mr. Hughart\\'s recollections. People often remember untrue things when they are attempting to reduce a possible prison sentence.\" Hughart faces up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine after admitting that he and others at Massey conspired to hide safety hazards inside the company\\'s mines between 2000 and 2010 -- a period that spans Blankenship\\'s time at the company\\'s helm. His sentencing is set for June 25.  His lawyer, Michael Whitt, would not comment on the statements made in court, and U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin told CNN through a spokesman, \"I\\'m not going to comment on the direction of the investigation.\"  Hughart was the president of Green Valley Resource Group, a different Massey subsidiary than the one that operated the Upper Big Branch mine. In his plea agreement, prosecutors state that he and others worked to conceal mine hazards from federal inspectors \"in part because of a belief that consistently following these laws would decrease coal production.\" Massey was the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States and the largest mine operator in Appalachia at the time of the Upper Big Branch explosion. But it had racked up an extensive list of violations before the disaster, and a 2011 report by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration found that Massey had  a history of \"systematic, intentional, and aggressive efforts\" to evade safety regulations .  The company kept two sets of books to mislead miners and inspectors, tipped off crews before surprise inspections and intimidated workers to prevent them from reporting violations, the report found.   Massey was bought by another company, Alpha Natural Resources, after the disaster. In December 2011, it settled with the Justice Department for a record $209 million in fines, penalties and compensation for families of the men killed at Upper Big Branch.  2010: Mine disaster board members survive attempt to oust them   Another Massey manager, Gary May,  admitted helping conceal hazards  from inspectors in 2012. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison in January. ',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Driven by a base demanding all-out opposition, Democratic senators are promising to turn Neil Gorsuch\\'s Supreme Court nomination into a slow-moving battle.  But whether at least 41 of the 48 Senate Democrats support a filibuster -- blocking Gorsuch from receiving a vote -- depends largely on whether the party\\'s most conservative members, many of whom are up for re-election in states President Donald Trump won, stick with its most progressive members. In the 2018 midterm elections, 10 Democrats in states Trump won are up for re-election.  Five of the Democrats are in reliably Republican states that voted overwhelmingly for Trump: Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin.  The other five are in swing states: Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin.  If Democrats are to block Gorsuch, they could only afford to lose eight members of the party with the first group of five, in reliably red states, the most likely departures.   Some have already indicated they\\'re not willing to support a Democratic blockade.  Manchin was set to meet Gorsuch Wednesday afternoon. On CNN\\'s \"New Day,\" he indicated he is unlikely to support a Democratic filibuster that would block Gorsuch from reaching the 60-vote threshold.  \"If you want the third branch of government to work, then you\\'ve got to have a nine-member Supreme Court, so if Republicans did something and now Democrats are going to do something, two wrongs don\\'t make a right,\" he said.  While some of their more liberal colleagues have already said they will oppose Gorsuch, Democratic senators from more moderate and conservative states are slow-walking -- careful not to look like they are mimicking the GOP\\'s tactics with the Merrick Garland nomination a year ago, when Republicans refused to grant the Obama nominee a hearing or vote. McCaskill said she has \"really tried to be calm and thorough about this and for every nominee, given them every chance for a thorough hearing, thorough vetting.\"  Donnelly said he will \"carefully review\" Gorsuch\\'s record. Tester sent Montana voters an email asking for their input on what he should ask Gorsuch.  \"It\\'s critically important that he has an understanding of the Constitution and is willing to defend it. I look forward to sitting down with Judge Gorsuch, looking him in the eye, asking him tough questions, and finding out if he shares our Montana values,\" Tester said in a statement.  In a vague statement, Heitkamp criticized Republicans for their handling of Garland\\'s nomination, but did not tip her own hand on Gorsuch.  \"It\\'s up to the Senate to fully consider any nominees to the Supreme Court and learn about them through meetings and congressional hearings,\" she said.  However, some of the Democrats in swing states Trump won have been much more critical of Gorsuch -- reflecting the push for all-out opposition from the party\\'s base.  \"Instead of putting forward a mainstream nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat, he has offered someone who will have a hard time earning bipartisan support,\" Baldwin said in a statement.  There\\'s little doubt where the Democratic base is: Liberals almost unanimously want to see the party\\'s senators fight Gorsuch, no matter the cost.  Republicans have a major weapon to get around any Democratic opposition -- the \"nuclear option.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, could convince his Republican colleagues to eliminate the 60-vote procedural threshold permanently and allow Gorsuch to be confirmed on a party-line vote.  Doing so would also cost Democrats their opportunity to stop future Trump Supreme Court picks unless the party regains the Senate majority.  Still, many progressives want Democrats to take the risk -- making clear to the country and their activist base that Republicans alone are cooperating with Trump. They\\'re already floating the possibility of primary challenges for Democrats who help Trump\\'s nominee.  Tim Tagaris, who ran Bernie Sanders\\' 2016 online fundraising juggernaut, tweeted: \"I\\'m just a guy who tried to rub a few nickels together for Bernie, but my gut says there\\'s good $$$ out there for primary challenges in 2018.\"  It\\'s not just Democrats in red states that bear watching.  Institutionalists such as Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin could vote to end a filibuster, advancing Gorsuch to a final up-or-down vote. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons said he is \"not going to do to President Trump\\'s nominee what the Republicans did to President Obama\\'s.\" ',\n",
       " 'Washington  (CNN) Rex Tillerson was sworn in as the Trump administration\\'s secretary of state Wednesday evening after having been confirmed by the Senate earlier in the day. \"It\\'s time to bring a clear-eyed focus to foreign affairs,\" President Donald Trump said at a White House ceremony, adding, \"All of us are better off when we act in concert and not conflict. There\\'s rarely been conflict in the world like we see today. Very sad.\" Vice President Mike Pence gave the oath of office to Tillerson. The former ExxonMobil CEO -- who was confirmed in the Senate by a vote of 56 to 43, with all Republicans in support and most Democrats voting against him -- fills one more slot on Trump\\'s national security team despite questions about his approach to Russia and state sponsors of terror, such as Iran.  Three Democratic senators split with their party to back Tillerson: Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Mark Warner of Virginia. They were joined by Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with Democrats. Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was sure Tillerson would be an effective leader at the State Department. \"Mr. Tillerson led a global enterprise with 75,000 employees, possesses deep relationships around the world, and understands the critical role of US leadership,\" Corker said in a statement. \"He has expressed a commitment to defend American values and to restore US credibility by strengthening old alliances and building new ones.\" Time of uncertainty Tillerson will take the helm of the US government\\'s oldest executive agency, founded in 1789, at a time when Trump has roiled some of America\\'s oldest and most stalwart allies.  The European Union president warned Tuesday that the Trump administration now poses a \"threat\" after the President\\'s declaration that NATO is \"obsolete. Trump also has repeatedly praised Brexit and said he expects other countries to leave the EU. Asian allies such as South Korea and Japan are seeking reassurance after Trump suggested reconsidering security ties.  On Wednesday, former CIA Director David Petraeus hammered home the message that the US\\' alliances are a crucial part of its national security.  \"Americans should not take the current international order for granted,\" Petraeus said told the House Armed Services Committee. \"It did not will itself into existence. We created it. Likewise, it is not naturally self-sustaining. We have sustained it. If we stop doing so, it will fray and, eventually collapse. This is precisely what some of our adversaries seek to encourage,\" he said, mentioning Russia in particular. The 64-year-old Texan had a shaky confirmation hearing before Corker\\'s committee in January, generating frustration among Democrats and Republicans alike after he dodged a series of questions. He wouldn\\'t agree when asked if Russia\\'s Vladimir Putin -- who has given Tillerson Russia\\'s highest civilian honor for his work there as an oil man -- is a war criminal. Tillerson also avoided condemning human rights abuses in China, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. And he sidestepped a direct answer about whether humans cause climate change.  Democrats also raised concerns about how long Tillerson would recuse himself from decisions that could affect ExxonMobil once he became the top US diplomat. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, opposed Tillerson\\'s nomination, questioning whether the Texan\\'s close business dealings with Moscow would impact his response to any Russian aggression and arguing that \"it is not the same thing to run a global business and run the State Department.\" \"We have reason to fear that Mr. Tillerson would run the State Department like he ran Exxon, where he repeatedly worked against US national interests,\" Murphy said Tuesday.  He noted that Tillerson opposed sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine and \"was awarded the Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin,\" Murphy said on the Senate floor. \"We have a President who has openly mocked human rights, who has supported vicious dictators, and a secretary of state who has made a career of doing business with some of the worst human rights violators in the world.\"  Sen. Diane Feinstein, a California Democrat, said she voted against Tillerson because he claimed not to know about Exxon\\'s history of lobbying Congress in opposition to sanctions on Iran and Russia. She cited public documents that show Exxon established a joint venture with Shell called Infineum. That venture\\'s purpose was to conduct business with Iran, Sudan and Syria, all considered by the US to be state sponsors of terror and under US sanctions.  \"During that time, Mr. Tillerson rose from senior vice president to president and director, and eventually to chairman and CEO of Exxon,\" Feinstein said. \"Yet, during his testimony, Mr. Tillerson claimed to be unaware of Infineum\\'s purposeful evasion of sanctions.\" Eventually, Tillerson narrowly won approval from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a 10-11 vote along party lines.  Democrats had hoped to delay a final vote in order to quiz Tillerson about the Trump administration\\'s travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries.   In his confirmation hearing, Tillerson said, \"I do not support targeting any particular group.\" Tillerson split from Trump on a series of issues in his confirmation hearing last month, condemning Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine as \"illegal\" and saying he did not oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that President Donald Trump has rejected.  Tillerson also pushed back against Trump\\'s campaign suggestion that South Korea and Japan should consider developing nuclear arsenals. And unlike Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the utility of NATO and its members\\' financial contributions, Tillerson expressed clear support for the alliance.

       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump invited several red state Democratic senators to a White House lunch Thursday in hopes of wooing their support for his Supreme Court nominee and other agenda items, a White House official told CNN Monday. The four senators -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana -- are up for re-election in 2018. A White House official confirmed the lunch, which was first reported by  USA Today , saying the President wants to talk to them -- and others -- about judges and his legislative package.  Trump will likely need the help of a few Democratic senators if he wants the legislative body to approve  Neil Gorsuch , his Supreme Court pick. Manchin met with Gorsuch earlier this month. Otherwise, Gorsuch\\'s confirmation will rely on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell changing the Senate rules in order for Republicans to approve the nominee on a party-line vote, something he is loathe to do. Heitkamp met with Trump in December, setting off panic among top Democratic congressional leaders, some of whom worried the moderate would leave the Senate to take a job with the Trump administration. While Heitkamp did not take a job, she has shown a willingness to meet and work with Trump. The President won North Dakota 63% to 27% for rival Hillary Clinton. Manchin also met with Trump in December, but said shortly after  that he will remain in the Senate  and not join the administration. Trump won West Virginia 68% to 26% for Clinton. \"Right now, I believe that I can best serve my state of West Virginia in the United States Senate,\" Manchin said in a statement following the December meeting. Trump won Donnelly\\'s Indiana 57% to 38% for Clinton and Tester\\'s Montana 56%-35%.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer predicted Tuesday that Senate Republicans will struggle to get enough Democratic support to achieve two of their main upcoming legislative goals: confirming Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court and repealing and replacing Obamacare.  Appearing on the ABC talk show \"The View,\" Schumer said Republicans will have a \"tough road to hoe\" to get 60 votes for Gorsuch because he believes the judge hasn\\'t been forthcoming while answering questions during courtesy calls with Democratic senators. Schumer said he had an \"eerie feeling\" after meeting with Gorsuch because the judge reminded him of Chief Justice John Roberts, whom Schumer said also refused to elaborate on his views about constitutional issues as he was ascending to the high court.   Roberts later joined decisions, such as one deciding a major voting rights case and a campaign finance ruling, that Schumer vehemently disagreed with. \"He should answer these questions,\" Schumer said of Gorsuch.  Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, who is escorting Gorsuch to his Senate meetings, dismissed Schumer\\'s complaints and said Gorsuch is doing nothing different than other judges who have been nominated to the Supreme Court. \"The judge has ethical responsibilities that he cannot answer questions about cases that may potentially come before the court. I\\'ve been in 58 meetings with him. He\\'s been very forthcoming. He has answered questions,\" Ayotte said in an interview with CNN. \"The meeting with Sen. Schumer, with all respect, he came in and asked him questions he knew he couldn\\'t answer.\" Schumer was asked why Democrats don\\'t block Gorsuch in the same way Republicans blocked Merrick Garland, whom President Barack Obama unsuccessfully tried to appoint last year to the seat. The New York Democrat said even if Democrats decided such a move was appropriate, they couldn\\'t do it because Republicans control the chamber, 52-48. \"But,\" Schumer said, referring to the filibuster option, \"they need 60 votes. And I believe if Gorsuch keeps it up, he\\'ll have a very rough road to hoe to get those 60 votes.\" Schumer said Democrats would use that same 60-vote threshold to protect Obamacare from President Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress who are vowing to dismantle it.  \"Because no Democrat has cooperated with the Republicans -- from the most liberal like Bernie Sanders to the most conservative like Joe Manchin -- they\\'re stuck. They\\'re not going to be able to repeal it, in my opinion,\" Schumer said. \"So we do have some power. We have to use it smartly and wisely. I tell people, I\\'m ready for the fight,\" Schumer said, raising his fists to applause from the New York City audience.  Schumer reiterated his call for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is a close political ally to Trump, to recuse himself from any investigations related to Russia\\'s alleged interference in the US presidential election. And he called on Trump to release his tax returns and divest all his holdings to ensure he is not improperly profiting from Russia.  \"So Russia tried to influence,\" Schumer said. \"Did Trump participate and help? If so, that\\'s really serious.\" Schumer blasted Trump for his ongoing fights with the press, which the senator said plays an important role in countering people in power. \"When he\\'s wrong and then calls them \\'fake news,\\' that\\'s trouble for democracy.\" Schumer said most Republicans haven\\'t broken with Trump because they are \"party loyalists\" and are happy with some of Trump\\'s moves, such as appointing Gorsuch. But he predicted that if Trump doesn\\'t change his ways, \"within three to four months, you\\'ll see a lot of Republicans breaking with him.\" On a separate issue, Schumer dismissed a charge from Trump that he cried \"fake tears\" at a recent news conference during which Schumer stood with a large group of immigrants and complained about Trump\\'s executive order on immigration that would ban refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim countries.  \"I get tearful,\" Schumer said, insisting the weeping was heartfelt and that it\\'s not the first time he\\'s done it.  He then recounted how he cried at his daughter\\'s wedding and earlier, when his children were aged 8 and 4, while watching \"Free Willy.\"  \"When he escaped, I started to cry. They ran out of the theater, they were so embarrassed,\" Schumer said. ',\n",
       " 'West Virginia\\'s attorney general and state legislators announced Tuesday that they\\'d join those investigating a chemical spill that left hundreds of thousands scrambling for safe water, with one senator promising \"there will definitely be a change.\" \"This whole series of events is unacceptable,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Unger, who will be leading the state legislative probe, echoing many others around West Virginia and elsewhere since the crisis boiled up last Thursday. These latest investigations came out the same day that a few thousand more West Virginians were told they could use their tap water again, for the first time in nearly a week. Still, nearly two-thirds of the nearly 300,000 people initially prohibited from using their taps still are waiting for the all-clear. Their headaches and heartaches trace to the leak of several thousand gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol -- a substance used in the coal industry -- from a storage tank belonging to a company called Freedom Industries. That chemical made its way into the Elk River, to a water plant about a mile upstream, then into the water system. Residents of nine counties -- including the one that is home to Charleston, West Virginia\\'s capital and most populated city -- were urged last week not to use their tap water to do anything except flush their toilets. With its strong odor as the telltale sign, officials warned that they couldn\\'t say that the water so many rely on to drink, cook using or wash themselves with was safe. Authorities worked to flush the foul-smelling chemical from the area water system, all while conducting tests that eventually showed it declining.  Chemical spill shines spotlight on loose regulation But it has been only recently some have been told they can use their water, such as the lifting of the \"do not use\" order Tuesday morning for the Southridge/Southside area near Charleston.  By Tuesday evening, about 114,000 people were advised it was safe for them to run their taps again -- with more than 180,000 remaining in limbo.  And it\\'s not just individual citizens in their homes who have been affected. Without safe water, schools and many businesses such as hotels, restaurants and more decided to close. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin\\'s office said schools would remain closed in four counties Wednesday, leaving about 46,000 students at leisure. Amid this widespread pain, a number of local, state and federal authorities have announced they\\'re launching investigations intent on getting to the bottom of what happened and holding people, agencies and companies responsible for the spill and possible issues in the response. Investigators from the Kanawha County Fire Department and the state Department of Environmental Protection were among the first at the scene.  By the next day, U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin announced that his office was also looking into what happened, telling CNN that \"even a negligent release of this kind could be a criminal violation.\" Also on the federal side, Environmental Protection Agency investigators went to the scene as did a team from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board. Plus, two U.S. congressmen --  Reps. Henry A. Waxman and Paul D. Tonko, Democrats from California and New York respectively -- said in a letter Monday they believe the spill may have exposed regulatory gaps in the country\\'s chemical control laws. Two new authorities in the state of West Virginia on Tuesday announced their own investigations.  Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said  in a statement that his office plans \"to get to the bottom of this and ensure that the public knows the truth\" -- including what happened, why and how might it have been prevented. \"We need to make sure this never happens again, and that responsible parties are held accountable,\" Morrisey said of his office\\'s \"unbiased, independent inquiry.\" And Unger, the Democratic state senator from Berkeley,  said the Joint Legislative Oversight Commission on State Water Resources  -- which he co-chairs -- is also digging into the \"unacceptable\" ordeal. Among other things, that legislative body will look into who knew what and when, \"and if no one knew, why not.\" \"There will definitely be a change to the way things have been done in the past,\" Unger said. And it\\'s not just West Virginians who are affected. The Greater Cincinnati Water Works, which serves that Ohio city and parts of four counties in Ohio and Kentucky, will temporarily stop taking water from the Ohio River as a precaution, allowing water that might contain traces of the chemical to pass the city, company spokeswoman Michele Ralston said Tuesday. Two Kentucky water systems -- in Ashland and Russell -- temporarily turned off their valve systems, Dick Brown, a spokesman for the Department for Environmental Protection, told CNN.  The move was strictly a precaution since the Elk River is a tributary to the Kanawha, which feeds into the Ohio River.  The Cincinnati utility is sampling the Ohio River water and so far hasn\\'t detected anything out of the ordinary, Ralston said. The move will not disrupt customers\\' water supplies because the company has a two-day reserve and a groundwater plant that can provide even more treated water, she said.  Opinion: It\\'s OK, the water\\'s safe to flush',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Republican Sen. Mike Lee suggested the President pick federal judge  Merrick Garland  as the next FBI director, a surprising recommendation following Republican efforts to block Garland from a seat on the Supreme Court last year. \"Instead of a special prosecutor, @realDonaldTrump should nominate Merrick Garland to replace James Comey,\" Lee  tweeted Thursday .  While he didn\\'t mention it in his tweet, such a move would also open up a highly coveted seat on the DC Circuit, where Garland currently serves as the chief judge. The Utah senator is a member of the Senate judiciary committee, which refused to hold a hearing on Garland when President Barack Obama  tapped him to replace  the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in early 2016. Lee pitched the idea to Trump\\'s advisers when he was at the White House on Wednesday, according to an aide. While the reason for his White House visit was unrelated -- it was to discuss tax reform -- he did bring up Garland as a possible FBI director separately, underscoring that the conservative senator is very serious about the idea. Republicans, who hold a majority in the Senate,  kept the seat vacant until a new president was sworn in  -- a strategy that proved worthwhile for their party when Trump won the election. Trump later nominated  Neil Gorsuch , who  was confirmed  in the face of intense anger from Democrats still fuming over the blocking of Garland. Democrat Amy Klobuchar, another senator on the judiciary committee,  responded to Lee\\'s tweet Thursday , saying Garland, a former prosecutor, would be a \"great idea\" for the FBI. She also called for a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump\\'s campaign\\'s possible ties to Russia.  A few hours later, Klobuchar sought to clarify her tweet, saying she doesn\\'t think Garland getting the gig is realistic. \"To be clear, this isn\\'t going to happen. I RTed bc it\\'s a good idea for Rs to think about consensus FBI candidates,\" she  tweeted . Some Democrats also expressed skepticism about the idea. \"After the way the Senate treated Merrick Garland, I hope this isn\\'t some idea of a consolation prize,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, told reporters. \"I doubt that he would consider it,\" he added. \"He\\'s the chief judge of the DC Circuit Court.\" Lee\\'s tweet came not long before senators started walking over from their offices to the Senate chamber for a vote on a separate issue. Many had just learned about the tweet or hadn\\'t heard about it when reporters began asking for their reaction.  \"I think it\\'s an interesting idea,\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. \"I actually haven\\'t thought about it.\"  \"That\\'s a great suggestion. We\\'ll see where it goes,\" said Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia. \"That\\'s the first I\\'ve heard about it.\"  \"Good choice!\" Sen. Lindsey Graham Graham, R-South Carolina, yelled out from an elevator as the doors were closing.  Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana, described it as an \"interesting thought.\" Asked if he thinks Republicans could get behind it, Daines said he didn\\'t know. \"I think he\\'d be qualified and capable,\" he added.  Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, paused for a few seconds before answering and said he liked the idea of creating a vacancy on the DC Circuit. \"Maybe I like it better the more I think about it,\" he told reporters. Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, also perked up when realizing that a seat would open up, which would give Trump an opportunity to appoint a replacement.  \"You\\'re getting my attention,\" he told reporters. While Sen. Tom Udall, D-New Mexico, said it would be a \"concern\" to make Garland\\'s seat open, he also said he still hasn\\'t \"given up\" on the idea of getting Garland on the Supreme Court.  Later Thursday, Lee told reporters he thinks the idea of Garland as the FBI director could probably get votes on \"both sides of the aisle.\" He also praised Garland as someone with a strong law enforcement background and extensive experience as a federal prosecutor. \"I think he fits that bill,\" he said. \"There are other people who would also. But he certainly does.\" Asked if he thinks the President will be opened to his idea, he shrugged his shoulders and said: \"We\\'ll see.\"  In  the wake of the Comey\\'s firing  from the FBI, some senators from both sides of the aisle have been calling for a replacement who can win bipartisan support.  The President\\'s nominee, however, only needs a simple majority of 51 votes to be confirmed in the Senate, which already has a 52-48 Republican majority.

       " 'CNN National Security Analyst John Kirby is a retired rear admiral in the US Navy who served as a spokesman for both the state and defense departments in the Obama administration. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.  (CNN) On its face -- and under less suspicious circumstances -- there would be nothing wrong with President Trump having an impromptu side meeting with Vladimir Putin. Such meetings are a staple of big, global confabs like the G-20. Indeed, it is often during these more intimate discussions that real progress on contentious issues can be made. But we can\\'t afford to take anything regarding Russia at face value right now.  Putin\\'s malevolence and the Trump administration\\'s repeated failure to come clean about their interactions with Russian officials -- including this one -- raise legitimate questions about where this most critical of bilateral relationships is heading. So, yes, in that context, this hour-long pull-aside matters. And, yes, it warrants scrutiny. First of all, we learned about it through media reporting, specifically an interview by NPR\\'s Audie Cornish of Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer. The White House only acknowledged it when pressed by reporters following up.  Unless they\\'re simply brief, chance encounters, meetings of this nature -- and certainly one between the President of the United States and the President of Russia -- are typically summarized by government officials. This readout, as it is called, accomplishes two things: it serves as a public record of the President\\'s participation in the conference, and provides a way to advance his message about whatever issues were discussed. That there was no overt acknowledgement of the meeting, let alone a readout, suggests either that the President\\'s staff didn\\'t know about it (troubling all by itself) or that the White House didn\\'t want it known (more troubling, given ongoing investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election).   Of course, the only way the White House could produce a readout would be to ask the President to write it, because there was no one else present from the US side. Not a senior national security expert. Not a notetaker. Not even a translator. No one.   That\\'s a problem. Let\\'s not forget how Mr. Trump once described the Russian leader and the risks inherent in trying to placate him.    Vladimir Putin, \"of whom I often speak highly for his intelligence and no-nonsense way, is a former KGB officer,\" Trump wrote in his 2011 book, \"Time to Get Tough.\" \"No sooner did Obama move into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue than he began making concessions and sacrificing American power on the altar of \\'improving relations\\' with Russia.\" The dubious charge against President Obama notwithstanding, one could be forgiven for thinking Trump would be more cautious. One might think he wouldn\\'t undertake a discussion with Vladimir Putin, even impromptu, without a strategy and without the backup and support of informed senior staff, who could help guide him through any minefields Putin might lay. And one should expect that Trump would not want to rely on a Russian government translator to make plain the points he was  trying to make.  There\\'s a reason we employ our own translators. You can rest easy that they will accurately and scrupulously convey the meaning of every word you utter. Don\\'t have one with you?  Go get one before you huddle with a foreign leader for anything more than a quick hello.  Whatever those two talked about -- and we will likely never know, because Trump is not likely to write his own readout -- it probably touched on any number of real and vexing issues between our two countries. Even the White House suggested as much. \"Throughout the G-20 and in all his other foreign engagements,\" said a White House official defending the meeting, \"President Trump has demonstrated American leadership by representing our interests and values on the world stage.\" So, safe to assume they didn\\'t talk about sports or the weather in Hamburg.   And that brings up another legitimate worry over this \"warm and friendly\" chat, as Bremmer described it. It can\\'t really be private, or at least it shouldn\\'t be.   Mr. Trump isn\\'t a private citizen anymore. He\\'s not a CEO. He\\'s the President.  That means he belongs to us, the American people. And that means when he talks to foreign leaders on our behalf (especially heads of state ... especially the head of state of the Russian Federation ... especially Vladimir Putin) there needs to be a record of it -- if not for public consumption now, then at the very least for historians later.   In this case, only the Russians will have a record of it. It\\'s hard to see how that serves us well. Because the record itself serves a greater purpose than just archival. It helps reinforce public trust and confidence in the institutions of government, in our very democracy. It reminds us that we are all Trump\\'s employers. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia summed it up nicely this morning on \"New Day.\" \"Transparency in the public sector is much different than in the private sector,\" he said.  \"When you\\'re in the public sector you have to gain the trust of constituents, those for and against you.\" Of course, some might argue that Trump doesn\\'t much care about earning the trust of those he deems are against him. And those who support him don\\'t much care about holding him to account for all this Russia business. They share the President\\'s conviction that it\\'s all just a witch hunt. But that\\'s beside the point. The point is that if, as the President maintains, there is nothing to hide with respect to Russia and if, as he asserted in a tweet, there was nothing sinister about the meeting itself, then it should have been better staffed, disclosed and documented.   Doesn\\'t seem like too much to ask. That same White House official -- the one who wouldn\\'t give his or her name -- said it was \"not merely perfectly normal, it is part of a president\\'s duties, to interact with world leaders.\" Couldn\\'t agree more. There\\'s nothing at all wrong with Trump and Putin having another discussion. There might even be good to come from it.  But it\\'s also not perfectly normal for there not to be disclosure of it and an accurate accounting.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Two of the most complex issues in American politics -- gun control and gerrymandering -- are colliding this week in Washington.  The Sunday night shooting in Las Vegas that left 59 dead and hundreds more injured has restarted a debate over whether Congress should impose stricter gun laws, particularly around background checks for gun buyers and the sale of semi-automatic firearms.  But Democrats pushing for those laws have run into the same roadblocks that stymied former President Barack Obama in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2012: The National Rifle Association\\'s overwhelming influence in Republican strongholds.  That power comes largely as a result of the extreme partisan makeup of most of the nation\\'s congressional districts: The primary is a more serious threat to most incumbents than the general election. And in Republican primaries, the NRA\\'s endorsement and advertising dollars carry huge weight.  \"It gives the NRA leadership an enormous outsized influence on these members,\" said Jason Kander, an Army National Guard veteran and the former Democratic Missouri secretary of state. \"They\\'re more afraid of losing a primary than they are more people losing their lives.\"  A major underpinning of the polarization of American politics over the last two decades has been the disappearance of \"swing seats.\" The Cook Political Report\\'s \"partisan voter index\" -- which measures how each congressional district performs at the congressional level compared to the nation as a whole -- scored 164 districts within five points of the average in 1997. But by this year, that number had dropped to 72 -- a 56% decline meaning that fewer than one-in-six House seats are naturally competitive.  District boundaries That\\'s where another issue -- gerrymandering, the use of partisanship in drawing the boundaries of congressional and state legislative districts -- comes in.  The Supreme Court heard a Wisconsin case Tuesday that could lead to new rules that would result in more competitive congressional maps.  Such a ruling, gun control advocates hope, would spur lawmakers of both parties representing those districts to court voters in the center, rather than playing to partisan extremes.  Some forms of gun control are overwhelmingly popular. This spring, the Pew Research Center found that 83% said they consider gun violence in the US a big problem -- including 50% who called it \"a very big problem.\" Sixty-eight percent told Pew they favor a ban on assault-style weapons, while 64% favor banning high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Majorities also favor background checks for private and gun show sales.  The popularity of those measures doesn\\'t matter, though, because majority Republicans in the House and Senate -- many from rural states where gun ownership and hunting is central to their culture and the NRA\\'s membership is powerful -- are more threatened by competitive primaries, where the NRA\\'s endorsement of a challenger who has opposed all forms of gun control would pose a grave threat.  \"This is one of the few issues where gerrymandering plays a large role,\" said Jon Soltz, the chairman of VoteVets, a progressive group that backs Democratic veterans in House and Senate races. Democrats\\' role The inability of Congress to pass stricter gun laws isn\\'t just because of Republicans.  In 2013, five Democrats, including North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, sank a measure written by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, R-Pennyslvania, to expand background checks.  Since then, Democrats have watched as President Donald Trump has risen to power in part by relying on the Republican base -- emphasizing issues like curbing immigration, limiting LGBT rights and more that energize that base and keep the party\\'s congressional leaders on board with his agenda, even when those issues are unpopular with the broader electorate.  If Trump was a Democrat, \"He would attack the NRA, because that\\'s what people are afraid of, and he would tie them to something that\\'s anti-American, like the Confederacy or Russia. And he would do it very aggressively with his own voice,\" Soltz said. Some Democrats have shed the caution with which they approached the 2013 gun control debate and are taking more aggressive stances.  Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said Congress should \"get off its ass.\" Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton refused to join Trump\\'s moment of silence for Las Vegas victims, saying that \"it\\'s time for action.\"  The Progressive Change Campaign Committee said this week it would send fundraising emails to its list of 1 million members on behalf of politicians who demand stricter gun laws. PCCC co-founder Adam Green said in an email to the group\\'s supporters that the effort is to \"reward those brave political leaders who go beyond kind thoughts and prayers -- and who demand action on guns.\"  Republican response But Republicans resisted those calls. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin tweeted, \"to all those political opportunists who are seizing on the tragedy in Las Vegas to call for more gun regs...You can\\'t regulate evil...\" Still, the House did opt to shelve a bill this week that would have loosened restrictions on purchasing gun silencers.  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday it wasn\\'t the time to talk gun control.  \"I think that there will be, certainly, time for that policy discussion to take place. But that\\'s not the place that we\\'re in at this moment,\" she said.',\n",
       " \" (CNN) Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, said Friday he will not join the Trump administration at a town hall in Lewisburg, West Virginia. According to a spokesperson from his office, Manchin told the crowd that would not be taking a Cabinet position, but instead will continue to work with the Trump White House in his capacity as a senator. Manchin, a moderate Democrat, representing a state that overwhelmingly voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, is up for re-election in 2018. Speculation about Manchin making a move to the Trump administration ramped up when the President visited West Virginia at the beginning of August and announced that the state's Democratic governor Jim Justice was switching parties to become a Republican. Trump's Cabinet currently has an opening after former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly left the agency to become the White House chief of staff. One possible scenario would've been for current Energy Secretary Rick Perry to move to helm DHS, opening the door for Manchin to take over as Energy secretary. Energy secretary is an attractive opportunity for Manchin who hails from a coal-rich state. If Manchin left the Senate, Justice would be able to appoint a Republican replacement, giving Trump and the GOP one more vote for big issues like health care and tax reform.\",\n",
       " ' (CNN) The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals this week ruled anti-gay assaults are not covered in the state\\'s hate crimes law. The decision came down to the definition of one word: sex.  How the case played out Prosecutors in Cabell County alleged that Steward Butler in April 2015 was riding in the car with some friends in Huntington when he saw two men kiss on the sidewalk. Butler allegedly \"voiced homophobic slurs toward\" the men, exited the vehicle and punched both of them, knocking one to the ground.  The next month, a grand jury indicted Butler on two counts of battery and two counts of violating an individual\\'s civil rights.   Butler challenged the civil rights charges and those were dismissed by a circuit court after \"concluding that the word \\'sex\\' in the West Virginia legal code was plain and unambiguous and could not be expanded to include \\'sexual orientation.\" Prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeals.  The decision In Tuesday\\'s ruling, the court was asked to mull the meaning of the word \"sex\" and if that includes \"sexual orientation.\" Thirty years ago, the state Legislature defined a civil rights crime as a \"threat, intimidation and/or injury to another person or another person\\'s property because of specifically enumerated characteristics, including the victim\\'s \\'sex,\\'\" the  decision states .   Citing definitions from three different dictionaries and a nationwide review of hate crime laws, the decision imparts it \"indisputably demonstrates that \"sex\" and \"sexual orientation\" are being treated as distinct categories.\"  In the war of words, the court ruled that what\\'s in the Legislature\\'s code stands: \"Based upon the common and plain meaning of the word \\'sex,\\' as well as the Legislature\\'s clear intent, we are left with the ineluctable conclusion that the word \\'sex\\' does not include \\'sexual orientation.\\'\" Raymond Nolan, attorney for Butler, agreed with the decision. \"It was a legislation function and the Supreme Court applied the law correctly.\" The justices\\' ruling points out more than two dozen efforts to add \"sexual orientation\" to the statute have failed. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said he understood the rationale. \"The facts of this case are deeply disturbing and heinous, and I remain steadfast in describing the alleged behavior as despicable, but such conduct does not give the judicial system a license to rewrite state law,\" Morrisey\\'s office said in a statement. \"That authority lies with the state Legislature and this decision preserves that balance.\" \"I\\'m not saying the opinion that the law shouldn\\'t be changed and neither did the court. But at the time that this occurred, the law of West Virginia did not include that class as protected by the law,\" Nolan said.   Others said the ruling was a step in the wrong direction. Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD\\'s president and CEO, said: \"At a time when anti-LGBTQ hate violence is on the rise, this ruling reiterates the need to advocate for LGBTQ-inclusive hate-crime laws in all states across the nation.\" The dissent \"The pertinent question is not whether the statute contains the words \"sexual orientation.\" Rather, it is whether the crime was committed because of the victims\\' sex,\" Justice Margaret L. Workman  wrote in dissent .   While Workman agrees that the statute does not include the \"two magic words\" sexual orientation, she said \"this court adopted an overly narrow focus, metaphorically missing the forest for the trees.\"  \"The majority\\'s answer is overly simplistic and constricted; the absence of the specific reference does not definitively resolve the question presented by this case,\" she wrote. While the civil rights charges cannot go forward, prosecutors can proceed with battery charges against Butler. ',\n",
       " 'Washington  (CNN) Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins announced Monday that he plans to challenge Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia, a seat that Republicans consider within their reach in next year\\'s midterm elections. Jenkins, who represents the state\\'s 3rd Congressional District, criticized Manchin in a  nearly three-minute announcement video , painting the incumbent senator as a Washington insider and knocking him for supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016. A former governor with deep ties to the state, Manchin has wide name recognition in West Virginia but faces re-election as a Democrat in a state that voted for President Donald Trump by 42 points over Clinton last November.  Manchin charts own path in Trump-era West Virginia Jenkins, who previously served as a Democrat in the West Virginia Senate, was elected to the US House in 2014 as a Republican, defeating incumbent Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall. Jenkins was re-elected in 2016.  The video also hits Manchin on his 2013 proposal to expand background checks for gun purchases following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.  Jefrey Pollock, a spokesperson for Manchin\\'s campaign, did not address each claim in the video, but sought to highlight Manchin\\'s bipartisan record.   \"Senator Manchin has always been an independent fighter for West Virginia, willing to take on either party to do what is right for his state,\" Pollock said in a statement. \"He looks forward to seeing the results of the GOP primary and having the voters review his clear record of delivering results for the people of West Virginia.\" Since Trump was elected, Manchin has sought to work with the president on a number of issues, even bucking his own party at times to support many of Trump\\'s picks for his Cabinet and the Supreme Court.  Jenkins also sought to align himself with Trump in the new video by including footage of him standing behind Trump at the White House when the President signed a law to repeal an Obama-era rule on the coal industry. (Manchin, along with West Virginia lawmakers, was at the same photo opportunity, but was not included in Jenkins\\' video.) Manchin is seeking a second full term. He first came to the US Senate in 2010 to fill the seat left vacant by Sen. Robert Byrd, and won election to a full term in 2012. Last week a former coal company employee, Bo Copley, also announced that he plans to run in the Republican primary. Copley became well-known in West Virginia last year after  confronting Hillary Clinton over a statement she made about the coal industry .  State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is also considered a potential Republican challenger.',\n",
       " 'Huntington, West Virginia (CNN) It was as if a light bulb went off over Sen. Joe Manchin\\'s head. \"Get Monte from \\'Say Yes to the Dress.\\' You know Monte -- what\\'s his last name?\" the Democratic senator spun around smiling, looking at everyone nearby. \"He\\'s a West Virginia boy!\" Manchin was touring a job fair hosted by his office last week and had just met the director of West Virginia\\'s affiliate for Dress for Success, an organization that helps provide professional clothes for women. As he\\'d been doing with others at the fair, the Democratic senator tried to think of someone who could help publicize their cause. \"He\\'s on \\'Say Yes to the Dress,\\'\" Manchin repeated, still searching for the last name of the celebrity bridal consultant from the TLC reality show. Minutes later, a staffer looking at a phone answered him. \"Durham,\" she said. \"Monte\\'s last name is Durham.\" It was the 17th job fair Manchin\\'s office had hosted, this time in Huntington, West Virginia, a city with nearly 50,000 people on the western edge of the state. A steady stream of hundreds flowed in and out of a small arena for more than three hours to circulate among the 160 vendors. When Manchin, who\\'s known for his retail politicking skills, showed up, he could barely make his way through the lobby. He wasn\\'t swarmed like a celebrity; rather, there was an air of familiarity.  People walked up to him to take selfies or say he was doing a good job. Others approached him with personal requests, asking for help in Washington or support for local projects. Some politely shook his hand but showed no interest in talking to him. On Manchin\\'s part, there was a lot of affection: squeezing of elderly women\\'s hands, shoulder slapping with men and hearty handshakes and hugs. He constantly tried to come up with ideas to help the people he encountered, from recovering drug addicts to veterans. Manchin was already a well-known figure in West Virginia and on the national stage, but he has seen renewed attention under the first 100 days of President Donald Trump\\'s administration. That\\'s because his status as one of the few Democrats up for re-election in a state that overwhelmingly voted for Trump has thrust him into a delicate position, where he can be both courted and criticized by both sides of the aisle. But make no mistake: Manchin is no shoe-in for his re-election next year. Though the senator -- who\\'s had a long career in public service -- has high name recognition in the state and a brand as a centrist Democrat, he\\'s still campaigning among an electorate that picked Trump over Hillary Clinton by a whopping 42 points. At the fair, a Cowboy-hat wearing Democrat named Charles Masters approached him with a photo of a younger Manchin standing next to a younger Bill Clinton, the last Democratic presidential candidate to win the Mountain State back in 1996. \"He is standing beside the greatest politician that ever lived,\" Masters later told CNN, talking about the photo and praising Clinton\\'s ability to work with Republicans. It was a stark illustration of the complex situation Manchin now finds himself in. He\\'s a Democrat who started his political career in a state that was once very comfortable with Democrats but now rejects some of the progressive trajectory the party has taken.   In fact,  Democrats in West Virginia outnumbered Republicans in last year\\'s election -- 44% to 31%  -- but the state still yielded Trump one of his greatest victory margins over Clinton. Manchin said people have pitched him the idea of abandoning his identity as a Democrat and adopting a different political affiliation. But he said he\\'s \"just not going to do it.\" \"People pretty much know my brand. They know who I am,\" he told CNN in an interview, while munching on a chicken salad sandwich after the fair. \"If I was a constituent and I looked at me and I said \\'Joe Manchin, he\\'s changed to a Republican or changed to an independent. What was his purpose -- strictly to get re-elected? To help him politically? Or did he change his brand, too? Is he going to be somebody different now? Maybe he\\'s not going to be the old Joe I\\'ve known for 30 years.\\' So I said, listen, I am who I am. Being a \\'D\\' or an \\'R\\' or not does not change anything.\" Aiming to be the \\'honest broker\\' Instead, Manchin is building a case that he\\'s a Democrat with Trump\\'s ear and can be what he calls an \"honest broker\" between the White House and his own party. \"I have access, I can speak to him,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think he looks at me from the standpoint, \\'Well you\\'re the opposition party and you\\'re the opposition.\\'\" Manchin said their rapport far surpasses his relationship with former President Barack Obama, of which he said \"there was none.\" Trump invited Manchin to Trump Tower in December to discuss a potential job as energy secretary. Not long after, Manchin announced  he\\'d be staying in the Senate . Still, he has visited the White House multiple times this year and speaks openly about conversing with Trump over the phone. Manchin has voted against only four of Trump\\'s cabinet or major administration nominees -- casting the fewest \"no\" votes among Democrats -- and was the only one in his party to confirm Jeff Sessions for attorney general.  He also worked behind the scenes with a bipartisan group of senators in search  of a deal to avert the \"nuclear option\"  in the battle over Neil Gorsuch, Trump\\'s pick for the Supreme Court. The talks were unsuccessful, and Manchin was vocal in his disappointment with both parties. He was one of three Democrats who ultimately went against their party\\'s filibuster and voted to confirm Gorsuch. Manchin\\'s relationship with the President -- as well as the senator\\'s efforts to cozy up to conservative media outlets like Breitbart -- have generated buzz this year, and last week Manchin sounded open to a potential endorsement from Trump, though he said he hasn\\'t spoken with the president about it. \"We\\'ll just see,\" he said. \"We\\'ll see if the political winds pull him in that direction.\" Manchin has also been critical of Trump at times. He opposed the President\\'s initial executive order on immigration back in February and has sent sharp warnings against trying to repeal Obamacare, saying government should simply focus on repairing it. Still, in his interview with CNN, Manchin offered perhaps his highest compliment to Trump. \"President Trump, from all I can observe in the first 100 days, is operating like the governor of the United States,\" said Manchin, a former governor himself. Manchin still relishes his time as his state\\'s chief executive (2005-2010) and almost achingly longs for that kind of role again. He\\'s part of a former governors caucus in the Senate, where there\\'s a running joke that the worst day as a governor is still better than the best day as a senator. \"We\\'re the ones I think that can solve the problems. I really believe that. Because we had to,\" he said. \"We could never afford the luxury of being real right or real left.\" \\'That will be a hard decision\\' Not being \"real right or real left\" can also be a fitting description for West Virginia voters.  Interviews with more than a dozen local residents in search of a job at the fair revealed not only mixed reviews of Manchin but a mosaic of perspectives that defy political norms. Some were Democrats who voted for Trump. Some were Republicans who liked Manchin. But most emphasized that, while they may be registered with a party, they primarily consider themselves independents.  Most shared a widespread distrust of politicians, even for the ones they like. Mike Mitchell, 66, a registered Democrat who votes \"for the person, not the party,\" wanted Clinton to win, but he backed Trump instead. And while he said he\\'s \"happy\" with Manchin as his senator and plans to vote for him next year, he said at the end of the day he\\'s \"not sure\" he can trust him. \"Government is awful. It\\'s just very awful,\" Mitchell said. \"Do you trust in who you believe in? It\\'s very hard anymore. Things are not like they used to be. Even around here.\" Jarrett Peters, 78, said he\\'s not registered with any party and voted for Trump last year. He said he likes the way things are going in Washington under the new administration and plans to vote for Manchin. Eddie Edwards, another Democrat who voted for Trump, wasn\\'t as pleased with the federal government, including Manchin. \"I guess he\\'s our guy. I don\\'t pay attention to politics because it pisses me off,\" Edwards said, expressing frustration at the lack of jobs in the area and federal attempts to roll back Obamacare. Marilyn Meade, a 63-year-old Democrat who also stressed that she votes \"for the person,\" preferred Bernie Sanders over Clinton in the primary, but said she likes Manchin\\'s moderate spirit and stated that she\\'ll be voting for him next year. To further demonstrate her independent approach, Meade added that she voted for her Republican congressman, Evan Jenkins.  It\\'s that same congressman who\\'s considering a challenge against Manchin next year, as is state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Meade was surprised to hear that Jenkins might run for the Senate, and her enthusiastic tone for Manchin suddenly changed. \"I don\\'t know, that will be a hard decision,\" she said.  The forming opposition  Republicans, who feel they have a strong path to victory in West Virginia, are prepared to throw the kitchen sink at Manchin next year. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has already started linking his voting record -- and that of other vulnerable Democrats up for re-election -- to that of liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren and pointed out last week that her political action committee donated to his campaign. It\\'s all part of an effort by Republicans to deflect attempts by these moderate Democrats to broaden their appeal among Trump voters.  \"Joe Manchin will speak conservative, but his actual voting record indicates otherwise,\" argued Conrad Lucas, chairman of the West Virginia GOP.  Also likely to come up is Manchin\\'s 2013 proposal with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey to expand background checks on gun purchases, a position that drew sharp rebuke from gun rights activists, including the National Rifle Association.  Manchin, a gun owner himself, defended his compromise push four years ago, which failed to advance in the Senate. Manchin feels that the proposal now  has a greater chance of success under Trump than under Obama , because Second Amendment supporters won\\'t be as worried that Trump will use it as a slippery slope toward more gun control.  \"There\\'s no one who believes he\\'s going to take their guns away,\" he said. Also anticipated from his opposition are attacks involving his daughter, Heather Bresch,  over criticism that her company, Mylan, raised prices for the life-saving medicine EpiPen by nearly 500% last year in order to enrich her company And Republicans are sure to reiterate Manchin\\'s loyalty to Clinton last year, even after she made the damaging comment in a CNN town hall that she was \"going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\" Clinton later said it was a misstatement, but the quote still reverberated around the state. She won a dismal 27% of the vote there in November. Manchin described her comment as \"horrible\" but defended his continued support of her after the remark, saying, \"I don\\'t think that was in her heart. I talked to her and we were going to do things for my state.\" \"I think the President respects and understands the loyalty that I had. I wasn\\'t against, I was just for,\" he said. \"And that person I was for got defeated.\" \\'I\\'m just going to get a boat\\' It\\'s no secret that when Manchin is in Washington, he lives on a houseboat that he named \"Almost Heaven.\" It was both a practical and symbolic decision. \"I didn\\'t want to be a permanent resident in Washington. And when you buy something, it\\'s almost like you\\'ve anchored yourself down,\" he said. \"So I told my wife, I\\'m just going to get a boat.\" Multiple stories have been written about Manchin using his boat as a vessel to bring senators together behind the scenes, aided by some food and drinks. He said last week that sometimes they play music by country singer Lee Greenwood, most known for his song \"God Bless the USA,\" which Trump used as his walk-on music for campaign rallies. Manchin painted a hard-to-imagine picture of kumbaya moments on the boat. \"It\\'s the most fulfilling thing to watch -- all these senators at the end of an evening, when we\\'re together, hug each other and basically sing \\'Proud to be an American,\\'\" he said. Manchin ranked No. 4 on a  bipartisan index by The Lugar Center and Georgetown University\\'s McCourt School of Public Policy , which ranks senators based on how many pieces of legislation they worked on with members of the opposite party.  The only Democrat who had a higher ranking was Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who\\'s also up for re-election next year in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. (The rankings measured legislative work from the 114th Congress, not the current session which started in January.) But acting as a bipartisan mediator can be a risky calculation during such partisan times. While it can appeal to more moderate voters, it can also remove the security blanket of getting the full support from your own party, and it can draw accusations of being a fair-weather politician based on the changing moods among voters. Manchin, as he approaches what\\'s expected to be a tough race, appears to be comfortably set in what can sometimes look like political no-man\\'s land.  \"The country is getting further and further apart. You know, you\\'re on the right or the left. There\\'s no middle,\" he said. \"And I\\'m not leaving the middle.\"',\n",
       " 'Washington  (CNN) A total of 10 Senate Democrats are up for re-election next year in states won by President Donald Trump.  Half of those senators are considered especially vulnerable because they represent states viewed as reliably red or states that have grown more Republican in recent years.  Those include Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana.   The other half hail from swing states that Trump won by a smaller margin and are less predictable.  Political observers will keep a close eye on this first group of senators and their actions on Capitol Hill. Will they support the President\\'s agenda? Or will they side with Democrats in big votes? Will they act as deal-makers between the two parties? In the first 100 days of the Trump administration, several have made White House visits to sit down in a group setting with the President or attend bill signings.  Three of those Democrats — Manchin, Heitkamp and Donnelly -- went against their own party\\'s filibuster of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and ultimately joined Republicans in the final confirmation vote.  This group of Democrats also had the fewest \"no\" votes on other major Trump nominees.   Meanwhile others, like McCaskill and Tester, refused to advance Gorsuch\\'s nomination and voted against his final confirmation.  As for legislation, a few of the senators have crossed party lines to vote with Republicans this year, including on a bill that would roll back Obama-era regulations to  prevent coal mine waste  from entering waterways  to keep guns out of the hands of certain people with mental health issues.   One thing they all share is ramped-up pressure from outside groups on the right and the left.  Republican groups targeted them in the Gorsuch fight, releasing ads in their Trump-won states urging them to advance Gorsuch\\'s nomination.  And while many of them have tried to position themselves as centrist or moderate Democrats,  Republicans have begun working to link them to liberal Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren.   They\\'ve also faced opposition from activists on the far left who have threatened primary challenges, though no serious challengers have stepped forward yet.   Here\\'s a look at what the five senators have done so far this year:  Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia  Manchin has long been pushing his brand as a centrist Democrat willing to work across the aisle. That came into full focus this year after Trump won West Virginia overwhelmingly (by 42 points) in the November election.   The senator met with Trump in December to discuss a potential spot as energy secretary, but soon after the meeting Manchin said he planned to stay in the Senate.  Since then, Manchin has visited the White House multiple times and told CNN last week he has a \"good relationship\" with Trump.  \"I have access, I can speak to him,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think he looks at me from the standpoint, \\'Well, you\\'re the opposition party and you\\'re the opposition.\\'\"  Manchin has voted against four of Trump\\'s Cabinet or major administration nominees -- casting the fewest \"no\" votes among Democrats -- and was the only one in his party to vote in favor of confirming Jeff Sessions for attorney general.   Manchin also worked behind the scenes with a bipartisan group of senators to urge both parties to find a deal to  avert the \"nuclear option\" in the battle over Gorsuch.  The talks were unsuccessful, but Manchin was vocal in his disappointment with both sides. He was one of three Democrats who ultimately voted to confirm Gorsuch.  In an unusual move, the senator has also been getting to know conservative media outlets, including Breitbart.  Manchin, who\\'s in his first full term as a senator, faces a tough re-election battle in West Virginia next year, where Republicans feel confident they can pick up a Senate seat, given the state\\'s support for Trump last year. Unlike other Democrats, who\\'ve benefited from grassroots enthusiasm, Manchin only raised about $550,000 in the first quarter.  Still, a Democrat, Jim Justice, was elected governor of West Virginia on the same ballot as Trump, showing the state\\'s not-so-predictable voting behavior.  Rep. Evan Jenkins is considering a run for the Republican nomination to challenge Manchin, as is state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.  But Manchin, who\\'s also served as governor of West Virginia, is a well-known figure in the state, and he\\'s relying on his brand as a bipartisan broker to carry him to a second term.  Heidi Heitkamp, D -- North Dakota  Heitkamp was first elected in 2012 and raked in $1.6 million this quarter, finishing out the first three months of the year with $2 million in cash on hand. Like Manchin, she also comes from a state where Trump crushed Hillary Clinton last year, by 36 points.  Heitkamp was another Democrat who voted to confirm Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and she voted against five of Trump\\'s nominees.  She also met with Trump during the transition about a potential Cabinet post and went to the White House with other senators for a lunch in February and separately for two bill signings.  Rep. Kevin Cramer, North Dakota\\'s at-large representative, is thinking about challenging Heitkamp next year. But  CNN\\'s Manu Raju reported earlier this month that Senate GOP officials have grown concerned  that Cramer\\'s penchant for controversial remarks could damage the party\\'s chances.  Heitkamp is heavily involved in tribal issues and introduced a bill this year to help Native American children who have experienced trauma. She\\'s also paired up with Republican senators like Dean Heller of Nevada, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and John Boozman of Arkansas on other bills.  Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana  Donnelly also was first elected to the Senate in 2012, following three terms as a congressman. Trump won the state of Indiana, where Vice President Mike Pence was recently the state\\'s governor, by 19 points.  Donnelly was the third Democrat to back Gorsuch, joining Manchin and Heitkamp, and he voted against six of Trump\\'s major nominees. (He did not cast a vote on the nomination of Scott Pruitt for EPA administrator.)  He was also part of the  bipartisan group of senators  that met with Trump at the White House in February about Gorsuch, along with Manchin, Heitkamp and Tester.  Donnelly raised $1.3 million in the first quarter for 2018 and has $2.5 million cash on hand.  Indiana Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita are among the Republicans who could challenge Donnelly.  Donnelly helped author two bills that were signed into law by Trump -- one that designated March 29 as National Vietnam War Veterans Day and one that designates the location of the National Desert Storm War Memorial. He also paired up with the junior senator from Indiana, Republican Todd Young, this year to introduce legislation supporting mental health services for police officers, and he authored a bill to end outsourcing.   Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri  McCaskill, facing pressure from both sides of the aisle, has also been trying to paint herself as a moderate. She\\'s up for a third term next year.  Republicans consider it a potentially strong pick-up seat, but there are some signs of advantages for McCaskill. While Trump won the state of Missouri by 19 points, the incumbent Republican senator, Roy Blunt, won by a far smaller margin of only three points on the same ballot.  And McCaskill raised a whopping $2.8 million in the first quarter and has $3 million in the bank. At a town-hall style meeting this month in Missouri, McCaskill was asked if she thinks the state\\'s large number of Trump voters will hurt her chances at re-election,  according to the New York Times.  \"I\\'ll tell you one thing that drives me crazy: my colleagues in Washington that are from places like California and New York who wanted to look down their nose at Trump voters,\" McCaskill said. \"I think that\\'s a huge mistake.\" At the same time, McCaskill, who has publicly acknowledged that she could face a primary challenger, has been critical of several of Trump\\'s policies. While McCaskill expressed concern about the use of the nuclear option to confirm Gorsuch, she ultimately joined her party in the filibuster and opposed his confirmation.  She also voted against seven of Trump\\'s nominees and did not vote on Tom Price\\'s nomination for Health and Human Services secretary.  McCaskill has helped introduce multiple bills this session aimed at eliminating waste in government. She\\'s the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.  Jon Tester, D-Montana Tester, who was first elected to the Senate in 2006, is up for a third term next year in Montana, which Trump won by 21 points. Still, in a sign of hope for Tester, the state\\'s Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, also won statewide election on the same ballot last November.  Like McCaskill, Tester opposed confirmation of Gorsuch, saying he didn\\'t feel like Gorsuch was strong enough on campaign finance issues. He also voted against eight of Trump\\'s other major nominees.  Tester showed a strong first quarter, bringing in $2 million and ending with $3.16 million cash on hand.  Trump signed a bill into law that Tester, the ranking member on the Veterans Affairs Committee, introduced earlier this year to expand and reform the Veterans Choice Program, which allows some veterans to use provide health care providers located near their homes. The bill was cosponsored by three Republican senators: John McCain, Johnny Isakson and Jerry Moran. Montana state Republican Sen. Albert Olszewski announced last week that he plans to challenge Tester,  according to local reports.   Previously the state\\'s at large congressman, Ryan Zinke, was considered the most likely Republican to challenge Tester, but he was tapped by Trump for secretary of the Interior Department.  This story has been updated. ',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Several Republican candidates endorsed by Steve Bannon began distancing themselves from the former White House chief strategist Wednesday after President Donald Trump said Bannon had \"lost his mind.\"  Two Bannon-backed Senate hopefuls downplayed the importance of his support and underscored their commitment to Trump\\'s agenda. In Arizona, a spokesman for Kelli Ward -- the conservative that hard-liner Bannon backed even as leading GOP strategists and Trump himself attempted to recruit someone else into the race to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake -- cast Bannon\\'s endorsement as unimportant.  \"Steve Bannon is only one of many high-profile endorsements Dr. Ward has received. Her focus remains on winning this race, which she is in a great position to do, and then helping President Trump advance an America First agenda,\" Ward press secretary Zachery Henry said.  Trump hammered Bannon in a remarkable four-paragraph statement after adapted excerpts of a forthcoming book in which Bannon described a Trump Tower meeting between Trump\\'s son and a group of Russians as \"treasonous\" and \"unpatriotic\" were released. The Wall Street Journal later reported that in another section of the book, Bannon is quoted describing Ivanka Trump as  \"dumb as a brick.\"   A spokeswoman for West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the Bannon-backed candidate who faces Rep. Evan Jenkins in the primary before a match-up with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, criticized Bannon\\'s remarks about Trump\\'s family.  \"Patrick Morrisey has been endorsed by many conservatives throughout West Virginia and America because of his strong conservative record. Attorney General Morrisey does not support these attacks on President Trump and his family, and was proud to stand with President Trump in 2016 when they were both overwhelmingly elected in West Virginia and when he cast his vote for Trump in the Electoral College,\" Morrisey spokeswoman Nachama Soloveichik said.  Her comment came an hour after Jenkins said in a statement that Morrisey \"should immediately disavow Bannon\\'s support.\"  Michael Grimm, a House candidate from New York who months ago heaped praise on Bannon, also sharply criticized the Breitbart executive.  \"I strongly denounce the comments by Steve Bannon as quoted by Michael Wolff. They are baseless attacks against the President\\'s family, beyond disturbing, and I fully support our Commander in Chief,\" Grimm said in a statement. Others offered at least tepid support for Bannon. In Nevada, Sen. Dean Heller\\'s campaign seized on the Trump-Bannon feud to attack his primary opponent, the Bannon-backed Danny Tarkanian.  \"Danny Tarkanian and Steve Bannon are frauds whose only skill is losing elections and costing Republicans seats,\" said Heller spokesman Keith Schipper.  Tarkanian, meanwhile, was the only candidate to say directly Wednesday that he still wants Bannon\\'s support. \"If Mr. Bannon chooses to support me in our effort to repeal and replace Dean Heller with someone who will truly have the President\\'s back, I welcome his support,\" he said. In Mississippi, state Sen. Chris McDaniel is considering launching a primary challenge against Sen. Roger Wicker -- with Bannon\\'s encouragement. McDaniel also didn\\'t distance himself from Bannon on Wednesday.  \"The establishment\\'s swamp monsters in Washington would like nothing more than to refill the swamp. Conservatives need to work together, not tear each other apart,\" he said in a text message when asked about the Trump-Bannon feud. \"If we are divided, they win. We can\\'t let them win.\"  In other Senate races, Bannon has endorsed Attorney General Josh Hawley in Missouri, state auditor Matt Rosendale in Montana, Rep. Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee and businessman Kevin Nicholson in Wisconsin. ',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) The next step in Steve Bannon\\'s scorched-earth war against Republican incumbents is an attempt to cut off money to those aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  The former chief strategist in President Donald Trump\\'s White House spent the weekend in Connecticut meeting with top Republican donors, a source familiar with Bannon\\'s plans said, as he recruits financial support for enough candidates to nationalize an anti-establishment message in 2018 GOP primaries. He\\'s held similar meetings in New York City and Washington, speaking with more than 25 major GOP donors so far, including hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, energy executive Dan Eberhart, private equity firm CEO John Childs and mega-donors Robert and Rebekah Mercer.   It was a continuation of what he\\'s done every day since September 26, when the Bannon-backed former judge Roy Moore ousted Sen. Luther Strange in an Alabama Republican primary: Hold meetings to recruit candidates and form a donor network to back them.  Bannon\\'s raison d\\'etre is to take on McConnell and nationalize Republicans behind Trump. His thinking -- evidenced by the Senate\\'s failure to advance Trump agenda items like health care -- is that Washington Republicans do not support Trump anyway. So 2018 could be a defining moment, shaking up the GOP and placing Trump\\'s 2016 campaign agenda at its forefront.  What Bannon is seeking from prospective candidates, the source said, is one simple pledge: That they won\\'t vote for McConnell as Senate majority leader.  Bannon\\'s recruiting efforts have intensified over the last two weeks. He is now looking for candidates who can replicate Sen. Mike Lee\\'s stunning ouster of former Sen. Robert Bennett at Utah\\'s 2010 Republican convention next year against Sen. Orrin Hatch. And he is in contact with allies in Nebraska seeking a candidate to take on Sen. Deb Fischer.  And that\\'s \"just a partial list,\" the source familiar with Bannon\\'s plans said.  \"Nobody\\'s safe,\" the source said. Already, he had spoken with Erik Prince, the Blackwater security contractor, and GOP mega-donor Foster Friess about running against Republican Sen. John Barrasso in Wyoming.  Bannon has also backed Kelli Ward\\'s effort to oust Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. He hosted Danny Tarkanian in Washington to discuss his campaign against Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada. And he met recently with Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel about taking on Sen. Roger Wicker. McDaniel, who said he is strongly considering running against Wicker, said Monday that he and Bannon have been in regular contact since 2014, when McDaniel came close to unseating Sen. Thad Cochran. Support from Bannon is helpful, McDaniel said, with strong Trump supporters who know Bannon was a leading figure on the President\\'s campaign and with those who read Breitbart.com, where Bannon is a top executive.  \"You factor in the big news he made in 2016,\" McDaniel said. \"You factor in his drive, his work ethic -- and people sense a winner and understand he can bring resources to bear, whether it\\'s Breitbart or with financial resources.\" Bannon also plans to get involved in the primaries in West Virginia and Missouri, two of Republicans\\' top opportunities to pick off Democratic-held seats next year. The plan, the source said, is for these Bannonites to nationalize their 2018 message with a consolidated, consistent argument across the map.  Bannon wants that message to be about \"big things\" -- that the grassroots Republican voters are in control and that they don\\'t need the establishment\\'s money or what he views as its corruption.  Avoiding another O\\'Donnell Bannon, the source said, believes his insurgent slate will be different than the tea party calamity of 2010, when flawed candidates like Christine O\\'Donnell in Delaware and Sharron Angle in Nevada cost the party seats, or 2012, when Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana made controversial remarks that swung their races in Democrats\\' favor.  Instead, Bannon, the source said, is recruiting candidates who are focused on substance -- particularly immigration and trade -- and could win over a loose coalition of social conservatives, tea party activists and values voters.  The test case was Alabama, where Moore -- a controversial figure who was twice ousted as state Supreme Court chief justice, first for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument and later for refusing to recognize the US Supreme Court\\'s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage -- defeated Strange, who benefited from $10 million in advertising from the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC.  In Alabama, Bannon broke with Trump, who had gone to Huntsville for a campaign rally for Strange just days before the election.  But the two are still in frequent contact. Bannon spoke to Trump in recent days, the source said, arguing that from Trump\\'s perspective the Senate is already lost because the President understands he has little support there.  As if to underscore that view, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker -- the Senate foreign relations committee chairman who is retiring rather than running for re-election in 2018 -- accused Trump  in a New York Times interview  of putting the nation on a path to World War III and said Trump\\'s presidency \"would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.\" It was Corker who had urged Trump in a White House meeting to go to Alabama and campaign for Strange -- a decision the President came to regret -- according to a source who spoke to the President. Bannon, meanwhile, has argued he is taking on Republicans who don\\'t support Trump\\'s policies.  Where\\'s money coming from? One source of financial support for Bannon-backed candidates is the Great America PAC, a super PAC led by former Ronald Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins.  The group plans to roll out an initial set of three endorsements of Republican candidates this week.    It isn\\'t expected to be as aggressive in seeking to unseat Republican incumbents as Bannon has been, but the super PAC does intend to support Senate candidates who back Trump\\'s agenda and call for the elimination of the Senate\\'s 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster -- potentially including Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel, Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale, West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey and more.  It could also support candidates who could weaken Democratic senators seen as potential 2020 Trump opponents, including Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts.  \"The reality here is, you have to tap into that Trump agenda intensity. And those are the candidates who can win in the general election,\" said Eric Beach, the Great America PAC co-chair.  Bannon, meanwhile, is focused on damaging people who might be considering 2020 in both parties -- including Mitt Romney, who could run for the Senate in Utah if Hatch retires.  The key, the source familiar with Bannon\\'s plans said, \"is to prove the theory of the case\" -- that Republicans who are anti-Trump should be gone.',\n",

We\\'ll see what happens.\" He said that if his late son  Beau Biden  hadn\\'t fallen ill, he would have run for president. \"No question,\" he said in the interview. \"I had planned on running, and I wasn\\'t running against Hillary or Bernie or anybody else. Honest to God, I thought that I was the best suited for the moment to be President.\" In  a separate interview with InStyle , Biden said of 2020: \"I\\'m familiar with the issues, and I think I could bring some talent there. So it\\'s not that I don\\'t think I\\'m equipped to do the job. We\\'ll just see.\" Biden\\'s book is scheduled to be released November 14. That\\'ll lead to another big round of interviews and news-making excerpts — so more Biden 2020 speculation (and on-the-record musing from Biden himself) is coming soon.  One more Biden note: He appeared in a public service announcement with  Lady Gaga  this week, urging action against sexual assault. \"It\\'s on us, it\\'s on everyone to intervene — to stop abuse when they see it, and when they hear about it, to intervene,\"  Biden says in the video .

Kamala Harris  was the first senator to announce she\\'ll  oppose an end-of-year spending bill  if lawmakers aren\\'t yet \"clear about what we are going to do to protect and take care of\" the undocumented immigrants brought into the United States as children whose status is now uncertain after President  Donald Trump   announced he\\'d eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  program.  — Harris has some weekend political travel. She\\'s in Rhode Island on Friday to raise money with Sen.  Sheldon Whitehouse . Then, on Saturday, she\\'s back in Washington delivering the keynote speech at the Human Rights Campaign\\'s national dinner — where  Hillary Clinton  and Amazon\\'s  Jeff Bezos  will also be on hand. And Sunday, Harris is in Richmond, campaigning for Virginia candidates ahead of the state\\'s November 7 election.  WARREN\\'S STOPS FOR HILL REPORTERS:  Massachusetts Sen.  Elizabeth Warren  stopped to  talk with CNN\\'s Jeremy Herb  about the Niger ambush after Pentagon officials briefed lawmakers Thursday. If you\\'re a Capitol Hill reporter, you already might be surprised: Warren is known for almost never stopping for interviews with congressional reporters. Warren seems to be opening up in recent weeks and it\\'s fair to read her warming up to the national media as possible 2020 preparation.  BOOKER COMES TO MENENDEZ\\'S DEFENSE:  Sen.  Cory Booker   came to the defense  of his New Jersey colleague, Sen.  Bob Menendez , this week. He testified in the senior senator\\'s corruption trial, saying: \"Bob has not forgotten where he comes from. He is someone who has known poverty and insecurity and what is honorable about him to me is that when I go home, and I am reminded of who I\\'m fighting for, I know  Bob Menendez  doesn\\'t just have my back but has their backs.\" In a rare display of bipartisan unity, South Carolina Sen.

Sanders on Friday is meeting with San Juan Mayor  Carmen Yulín Cruz , touring the island and holding meetings about how Congress can help Puerto Rico\\'s hurricane recovery efforts. Cuomo on Thursday  tweeted : \"The federal government has said it can\\'t stay in Puerto Rico forever, but New York isn\\'t leaving until the job is done.\"  STEYER\\'S LAUNCH?

MARK CUBAN\\'S PARTY SURPRISE:  Billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner  Mark Cuban  says if he runs for president in 2020,  he would do so as a Republican  — meaning he\\'d primary Trump. \"I think there\\'s a place for somebody who\\'s socially a centrist but I\\'m very fiscally conservative,\" he said. DISPATCH FROM THE DEM MINES from CNN\\'s  Gregory Krieg : There will be no 2018 Democratic primary bloodbath. The party can thank  Bernie Sanders  and his allies, who kept their eyes down ballot, and moderates like West Virginia\\'s  Joe Manchin , who kept close to the base and so didn\\'t invite unrest from the #resistance. Outside of California, where Sen.  Dianne Feinstein  faces a fight, and a few feisty Houses races aside, most of the heat is coming from gubernatorial contests. Iowa is interesting, crowded and (expected to be) intense, with seven candidates and no clear favorite.  Cathy Glasson , a nurse and union leader is the likely Berniecrat pick and businessman  Fred Hubbell  — already up with TV ads last Friday! — are a couple buzzy names. Also to watch: Does a progressive challenger emerge to take on Cuomo, a potential 2020er, in New York? And who survives what\\'s going to be a pricey primary in Illinois -- a Pritzker or a Kennedy?

       " ' (CNN) Senate Republicans were largely buoyed Thursday by  the release of a House Republican tax bill,  a key step toward passing tax reform, one of their top legislative goals.  They argued that tax reform would create jobs and jump-start the economy, even as they privately hope it will energize their party\\'s midterm election chances, which faced a setback when their efforts  to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act failed .  While a couple of GOP senators raised questions about aspects of the House bill, most said they were pleased with the key elements and wanted to study the details before weighing in. READ: The Republican tax plan bill \"I don\\'t think there a lot of surprises, but I don\\'t really want to comment until I get a full grasp of what\\'s been laid out,\" said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, one of the few Republicans vocally skeptical of Congress\\'s ability to pass tax reform without adding to the deficit. He said he hoped the tax reform would be permanent, something the House was not able to do with all its proposed changes, in part, to meet the Senate\\'s strict rules related to deficit reduction if Senate Republicans want to pass a tax bill on a party-line vote. The GOP bill had to not cost more than $1.5 trillion in order to be acceptable under budget rules, and some of the tax changes many members pushed for would have put the cost over that threshold. \"One of the attributes that we hoped would be there was permanence,\" Corker said. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida,  tweeted that  he was disappointed by the size of the expansion of the child tax credit, from $1,000 to $1,600. He wanted it raised to $2,000.  But he said he wasn\\'t overly concerned about it because he sees the House proposal as just a place to start. \"I\\'m not generally overall going to freak out the way everyone else is. It\\'s a starting point,\" Rubio said. \"Where we start and where we end are not going to be the same place.\" After the effort to roll back Obamacare fell apart, with the House and Senate GOP pursuing different strategies on that issue and ended up with no bill approved, House Speaker Paul Ryan,  in an interview with CNN , insisted that tax reform would be different. \"What we wanted to do is make sure that we remove any kind of big disagreement and got on the same page, and that\\'s what this reflects,\" the Wisconsin Republican told CNN\\'s Phil Mattingly. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip and a member of the tax-writing finance committee, praised the work of the House but the Senate would not be \"bound\" by it when senators begin work of their version. \"I think what the House did is instructive but we\\'re not bound by what the House did. But there\\'s been a lot of discussion so there is going to be, I would say, a fair amount of commonality,\" he said. \"But not completely.\" Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he couldn\\'t \"wait to get it, look it over, and see if we can take it or amend it and make it better.\" He said he personally believes that the House limits on mortgage interest deductions to the first $500,000 in value should be in the bill. That proposal could be controversial in parts of the country with high real estate values.  Sen. Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, where real estate prices are lower than many other states, agreed. \"What we\\'re trying to do is encourage home ownership. But $500,000? Most places you can buy a nice home. If you\\'re going to lower rates, you\\'re going to have to take away other things that have put in the tax code. I think we\\'re on the right path. I can live with it,\" he said. Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, who is facing a tough reelection next year, said he needed more time to study the House bill before saying what he thought. \"It\\'s on my desk and I\\'m going through it as we speak,\" he told a reporter. \"I\\'ll get back to you later.\" Most Democratic senators blasted the House bill, arguing it would raise taxes on the middle class and give big breaks to the wealthy. \"This bill is about giving enough crumbs to the middle class to distract from the multi-trillion dollar giveaways to corporations that ship jobs overseas and the mega-wealthy,\" said. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, a member of the finance committee. \"Republicans are repeating the same mistakes they made with health care. It\\'s the same old playbook: jam through a bill, cobbled together in a back room, that sticks it to hard-working Americans,\" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. \"Republicans are desperately seeking a \\'win\\' in Congress, but this one would only come at great cost to the American people.\" One Democrat that President Donald Trump and other Republicans  have tried to convince to vote  for the bill sounded skeptical. \"I\\'m not ruling out support it,\" West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said before being able to read details of the bill. But later he put out a statement that was highly critical of it. \"The tax reform proposal unveiled today does not pass this test and does not reflect the goals President Trump and I have discussed over the last several months,\" he said, before adding the he would continue to work to improve the bill. Senate GOP leaders have said they want to pass a bill before Thanksgiving and then use December to merge their bill with a House-passed version before sending it to Trump for his signature.

       " ' (CNN) Former Trump foreign policy adviser  Carter Page  privately testified Thursday that he mentioned to Jeff Sessions he was traveling to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign — as new questions emerge about the attorney general\\'s comments to Congress about Russia and the Trump campaign. During more than six hours of closed-door testimony, Page said that he informed Sessions about his coming July 2016 trip to Russia, which Page told CNN was unconnected to his campaign role. Page described the conversation to CNN after he finished talking to the House intelligence committee. Sessions\\' discussion with Page will fuel further scrutiny about what the attorney general knew about connections between the Trump campaign and Russia — and communications about Russia that he did not disclose despite a persistent line of questioning in three separate hearings this year. Page\\'s testimony was one of the more highly anticipated events in the congressional Russia investigations, given the scrutiny he\\'s faced because of his connections to Russia and his visible role pushing back about his Russia ties in nationally televised interviews. Rep.  Mike Conaway , the Texas Republican who is leading the House intelligence committees Russia probe, confirmed to CNN that Page told the committee he had informed Sessions about his trip, though Conaway downplayed its significance. \"I don\\'t make anything sinister out of it. He said Sessions did not react or comment one way or the other,\" Conaway said in an interview. \"If I were Sessions, I wouldn\\'t have recalled it either. It was just in passing. He was walking out of the room. A guy he had never met before, grabs him, \\'Hey, I\\'m out on the team. I changed my travel plans to go to Russia.\\'\" Page told CNN after the interview that he informed Sessions about the trip during a group dinner in Washington, and that he mentioned it in passing. \"Back in June 2016, I mentioned in passing that I happened to be planning to give a speech at a university in Moscow,\" Page told CNN. \"Completely unrelated to my limited volunteer role with the campaign and as I\\'ve done dozens of times throughout my life. Understandably, it was as irrelevant then as it is now. If it weren\\'t for the dodgy dossier and all the chaos that those complete lies had created, my passing comment\\'s complete lack of relevance should go without saying.\" Page said it was the only time he met Sessions.  A source familiar with the meeting told CNN that the encounter occurred at a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club, attended by members of the Trump national security team, including Sessions. Near the end of the dinner, Page approached Sessions to say hello and thanked the then-senator for the dinner, and Page also mentioned he was headed to Russia. Sessions didn\\'t respond and moved on to the next person waiting to shake his hand, this source said. A Justice spokesperson declined to comment. Several lawmakers from both parties described the session as meandering, at-times confusing and contradictory. Page did not have a lawyer present, which is highly unusual, lawmakers said. Conaway said that Page was \"fulsome\" in his answers and he answered all of the questions the committee asked. Moreover, Page reached a rare agreement to allow the committee to release a transcript of his testimony, something that will happen early next week. Some members said his testimony will help move the investigation forward, though Page told the committee that the Trump campaign made him sign a non-disclosure agreement. \"It was terrific to have the opportunity to help clear the record as to the falsehoods from the dodgy dossier, which started this whole thing against me in the final two months before the election,\" Page told reporters after his marathon session, referring to the Trump-Russia dossier produced by former British agent Christopher Steele. \"I\\'m glad the truth is finally becoming known.\" Page interacted with Sessions because the then-Alabama senator was leading the national security team for the Trump campaign. Sessions  is already facing new questions  over his testimony on Capitol Hill about Russia and the Trump campaign following the revelations this week that he rejected a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed by foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty for making a false statement to the FBI about contacts with people connected with the Russian government. At a June Senate intelligence committee hearing, Sessions testified that he wasn\\'t aware of any conversations between \"anyone connected to the Trump campaign\" and Russians about \"any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States.\" In another exchange with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Sessions was asked if Page met with Russian officials \"at any point during the campaign.\" \"I don\\'t know,\" Sessions responded. Asked at a Senate hearing last month whether he believed Trump campaign surrogates had communications with Russians, Sessions replied, \"I did not and I\\'m not aware of anyone else that did, and I don\\'t believe it happened.\" Democrats on the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees are interested in formally asking Sessions to clarify his testimony, according to a Senate aide. Page traveled to Moscow for a few days in early July 2016, where he gave a lecture critical of US foreign policy and later met with Russians whom he described as academic scholars and business leaders. He has said that the topic of sanctions might have come up in his conversations but that he was not there as an emissary of the Trump campaign. After the trip, the FBI grew concerned that he had been compromised by Russian operatives,  US officials previously told CNN . The committee has asked Page to produce more documents, according to members, to comply with the subpoena they previously issued.

       " 'Washington (CNN) The Senate voted Wednesday to confirm Sen.  Jeff Sessions  of Alabama as the next attorney general, surviving a vocal push by Democrats to derail his nomination. The 52-47 vote was mostly along party lines, though one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin, joined the Republicans to back their Alabama colleague.   Who voted for and against Sessions The final vote for Sessions -- one of Trump\\'s closest advisers and his earliest supporter in the Senate -- came after 30 hours of debate from Democrats and a stunning fight between liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Senate Republicans which ended in her being forced to sit down after she was accused of impugning Sessions.  Sessions said he would resign from his office 11:59 p.m. Wednesday and the White House is scheduled to swear him in Thursday morning.  \"It was a special night,\" Sessions told reporters on Capitol Hill after his confirmation. \"I appreciate the friendship from my colleagues -- even those who, many of them who didn\\'t feel able to vote for me. They were cordial, and so we continue to have good relations and will continue to do the best I can.\" The fight over Sessions nomination spurred some of the most jarring, and at times personal attacks, rooted in allegations that Sessions was a racist -- claims the Alabama senator and his supporters have fiercely denied. Even early in the nomination process, one of Sessions\\' colleagues, Cory Booker, became the first sitting senator to testify against another sitting senator during his confirmation hearing.  Shortly before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor to sing the praises of Sessions, after Democrats spent hours criticizing him. \"He\\'s just a likable guy, one of the most humble and most considerate people you\\'ll ever meet,\" McConnell said. \"He\\'s a true Southern gentleman.\" While some left-leaning groups issued statements promising to stand up and continue raising awareness about their disagreements with Sessions, Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe questioned how effective they could be in trying to keep up the fight.   \"What are they going to do? He\\'s the attorney general. Where does the fight start? Where\\'s the ammunition?\" He said to reporters. In the debate Tuesday evening, after Republicans already blocked a Senate filibuster, Warren reignited that debate by reading from a 1986 letter Coretta Scott King sent opposing Sessions for a federal judgeship.  \"\\'Anyone who has used the power of his office as United States Attorney to intimidate and chill the free exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to our courts,\\'\" Warren read from King\\'s letter. McConnell accused Warren of impugning Sessions on the Senate floor -- a violation of Senate rules -- and after a series of procedural votes, she was forced to sit down and stop debating. Warren\\'s censure and subsequent reaction continued to largely overshadow the Sessions fight in the hours before his vote, but the Massachusetts Democrat told CNN\\'s Manu Raju said Sessions, whom she served with in the chamber, is just the latest example of a poor Cabinet choice.   \"We may not have the votes to stop him,\" she said, \"but we sure as hell need to make it clear to the Republicans and to the American people exactly who Donald Trump is putting in charge of our government.\" Sessions was ultimately blocked from a federal judgeship and carried that battle scar into Wednesday\\'s final confirmation battle.  Democrats not done yet on nominees  Democrats are expected to repeat the same 30-hour debate plan for Health and Human Services Secretary nominee Tom Price and could easily drag the fight over Treasury pick Steven Mnuchin into the weekend.  Tuesday, Betsy DeVos was confirmed, 51-50, in a battle that sparked impassioned protests and the flooding of Senate switchboards by angry Democrats and liberal activists.  The tactics have yet to work in actually defeating any of Trump\\'s Cabinet picks, but they have fired up a base of Democratic and liberal activists irate over a series of Trump actions, not least of which was picking a Republican mega-donor in DeVos to run the Department of Education. \"When you get millions of calls and demonstrations and a nominee is exposed for being who they are, it\\'s going to have a profound and positive effect, even if she gains office. So we\\'re very happy with the results and we\\'re going to continue them,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday.  But Republicans have chafed at what they call \"historic obstruction\" and have argued that Trump needs his team in place. \"This is the slowest time for a new Cabinet to be up and running since George Washington. This level of obstruction at the beginning of an administration is really record-setting in a very unfortunate way. It\\'s really time for our friends on the other side to get over the election, let this administration get up and get running,\" McConnell said Tuesday.  The only nominee who appears to be in any trouble at this point is Labor secretary pick Andrew Puzder, who is embroiled in controversy following news that he hired an undocumented worker to clean his house and was forced to pay back taxes. A series of Republicans on the Senate panel tasked with vetting him declined to say Tuesday whether they still supported Puzder.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia slammed pharmaceutical companies on Thursday, arguing they should be held legally liable for their role in the ongoing opioid crisis. \"This is a business plan. They are liable,\" Manchin told CNN\\'s Jake Tapper on \"The Lead\" when asked if he believes the pharmaceutical industry needs to be found legally liable in some cases for the prevalence of opioids in the United States.  Manchin added that the companies that supply opioids should be charged fees for the drugs they produce and for having inundated the market with the highly addictive drugs. \"This is what\\'s caused it. Can\\'t we at least charge the pharmaceutical companies one penny per milligram for every opiate they produce?\" Manchin added. President Donald Trump earlier Thursday  declared a nationwide public health emergency  to address the ongoing opioid epidemic. Manchin said that declaration is of the utmost importance. \"Every state\\'s been affected,\" he said of the crisis. \"I\\'m ground zero, West Virginia, more deaths per capita, more people addicted per capita.\" More funding is needed to combat the crisis, he said. \"This is like fighting a war,\" Manchin said about the need for funding. \"You\\'ve got your soldiers on the front line fighting ...

The meeting with Gary Cohn, Trump\\'s top economic adviser, and Marc Short, Trump\\'s director of legislative affairs, is a signal that the Trump administration believes they may need Democrats to pass Trump\\'s top legislative agenda. Short confirmed the meeting to CNN, adding that the Tuesday gathering is \"not the first time\" the White House has met with Democrats on tax reform. Tax reform, Short said, will be the \"entire purpose of the meeting.\" The meeting was organized, according to two sources with knowledge of the gathering, by Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia who has shown a willingness to work with the Trump administration on tax reform. House Republicans, with Trump\\'s backing, released their tax proposal last week, pledging to cut tax rates for corporations, simplify the tax code and erase some popular tax deductions. Republicans hope the reform, which has become the President\\'s primary legislative target after the GOP failed to overhaul the health care system, would allow most Americans to file their taxes on a large postcard. But Republicans in Washington, particularly those in the White House, learned during the failed health care push that relying solely on Republican votes in a tightly divided Senate could be a recipe for failure. After narrowly passing the House, Trump\\'s plan to repeal President Barack Obama\\'s sweeping health care law failed in the Senate when three Republican senators broke with their party earlier this year. Tuesday\\'s meeting also could be a cover for the White House. As one White House official noted, these meetings ensure that Democrats won\\'t be able to credibly say \"the administration didn\\'t include them in the process once it comes time to vote for tax cuts.\" There is pressure on moderate Democrats in the Senate, particularly those up for reelection in states Trump win handily in 2016 like Manchin, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, to back Trump\\'s tax plan. And Tuesday\\'s meeting could see Trump administration officials ratcheting up that pressure. But Manchin, after the tax plan was rolled out, said he remained skeptical of the plan. White House spokesman Raj Shah, asked about the meeting, said the Trump administration \"has been clear from the beginning that there is no reason tax cuts for the middle class and pro-growth reform for businesses should be partisan issues.\"  Even so, tax reform has become a partisan issue, with many Democrats slamming the plan as nothing more than a tax cut for wealthy Americans and large corporations. \"They give with one hand and take away with the other,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday. \"This thing will explode the deficit, the national debt. And one reason is they\\'re giving a $1.5 trillion cut to corporate America.\" CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly identify Sen. Heidi Heitkamp\\'s home state.

       " ' (CNN) President Donald Trump promised a big announcement Thursday night at his campaign-style rally in West Virginia.  The announcement turned out to be the decision by  Gov. Jim Justice to switch from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party . Trump took credit for the switch, and cast Justice as the leading edge of common-sense populists who are just plain sick of political correctness and the national Democratic Party. For more perspective on Justice\\'s move and how Trump is perceived in the Mountain State, I reached out to one and only  Hoppy Kercheval , a radio talk show host -- and columnist -- in the state. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: The Jim Justice party switch. How expected or unexpected was it? Hoppy : The rumors had been circulating for some time. He talked about it with close advisers, wondering if the move would empower him to accomplish more with the Republican majorities in the House of Delegates and the Senate. But the talk never seemed to go any farther. After all, Justice had just won election as a Democrat a few months earlier. How wise would it be to run as a member of one party, then switch not long after the election? Additionally, Justice didn\\'t seem to pay much attention to party labels. He didn\\'t fly the Democratic flag during the campaign and during the legislative session he was as apt to bond with Republicans as Democrats. He said party affiliation was not important to him; he just wanted to work with anyone who could make West Virginia better. Cillizza: It\\'s been less than 24 hours. But how is the Justice switch going over in the state? Do you anticipate him having ANY electoral problems because of it? Hoppy : The news is shocking.  Even his top staff and close advisers did not know.  One told me he found out about it on Twitter.  Another told me yesterday he wouldn\\'t believe it until he heard it from the Governor\\'s mouth. Anti-Trump protesters gathered at the Huntington venue last night chanted, \"Jim Justice is a traitor.\"   Republican leaders are cautious. Remember,  this is a governor who proposed $500 million in new taxes  during the last legislative session and got into some personal battles with them.   But also keep in mind that Donald Trump is popular here. He got 68% of the vote last November and  Gallup still has his approval rating in the state at 60% . Right now, being aligned with Trump in West Virginia is a good thing. Cillizza: Sen. Joe Manchin is now  one of two  statewide elected Democrat. He\\'s also up for reelection next November. How concerning is the Justice switch for Manchin -- if at all? Hoppy : Manchin is disappointed. He and Justice are close. In fact, Justice called Manchin in 2015 and pledged his support for Manchin if he decided to run for governor. BUT, Justice also said if Manchin was not going to run, he wanted to. Manchin is politically pragmatic. So after the dust settles, I don\\'t think it will mean much one way or another in the Senate race. It would be hard to imagine Justice inserting himself in the Senate race in support of the Republican candidate. My guess is Justice stays out of that and Manchin and the nominee fight it out. Cillizza: Trump appeared with Justice at a rally last night and seemed to get a hero\\'s welcome. Is Trump as popular as he was in November 2016? Why or why not?  Hoppy : As noted above, Trump is still very strong here, and it\\'s less about party than populism. Trump tapped into the anger and frustration in rural America. Elites want to paint that as racism and xenophobia, and there is some of that. But, West Virginia and rural America has a series of socioeconomic problems -- drugs, economy, family breakdown -- and they feel like they are being ignored, especially by the national Democratic Party. While all the talk in DC has been about Russia and tweets, Trump has actually followed through on campaign promises made in West Virginia, including  pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement ,  stopping the Clean Power Plan  and  reining in the Environmental Protection Agency . Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \"The one word West Virginians would use to describe Trump and Justice is __________.\" Now, explain. Hoppy : \"Hope.\"   As I said in No. 4, this area is struggling through some difficult times. Small town West Virginia and small town America have myriad challenges that have nothing to do with climate change or identity politics. Trump campaigned on \"Make America Great Again\" and Justice constantly talks about how West Virginia deserves better.   These themes align to provide a reason to hope. It\\'s really less about party politics and more about a kind of populism.

       " 'Washington (CNN) Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin is heading into his re-election fight as a top target for Republicans, but to hear him tell it, he does not care about the pressure on his seat. \"I just don\\'t give a s--t,\" Manchin told the  Charleston Gazette-Mail  when asked about criticism from an opponent. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican challenging Manchin in the 2018 Senate race, issued a letter last week calling on Manchin to resign his position in Senate Democratic leadership, casting Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as far too liberal and at odds with the interests of West Virginia. Manchin was one of three Democrats not to sign onto a recent letter laying out Democratic priorities on the tax reform debate. He told the Gazette-Mail in a story published Sunday he supported his fellow Democrats in principle but wanted to keep leeway for Republican support. \"The bottom line is, if it doesn\\'t help West Virginia, it doesn\\'t make sense to me,\" Manchin said. \"And just because there\\'s an election doesn\\'t mean I sign on or don\\'t sign on.\" When the paper went on to ask Manchin if his decision was about politics and the coming election, Manchin offered a forceful denial. \"Don\\'t care if I get elected,\" Manchin said. \"Don\\'t care if I get defeated. How about that?\"  Manchin, one of the most conservative Senate Democrats, faces a tough re-election fight in a state that leans strongly Republican. In 2016, President Donald Trump won the state by a massive margin. Election results from the West Virginia Secretary of State\\'s office said Trump garnered 68.6% of the vote compared to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\\'s total of 26.5%. And last week, Trump visited the state and spoke with West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, who used the opportunity  to announce  he was leaving the Democratic Party to become a Republican. In response to Manchin\\'s comments, Morrisey issued a statement reiterating his call for Manchin to resign his leadership role. Manchin\\'s office declined CNN\\'s request for comment Monday.

       " 'Washington (CNN) The Senate voted in favor of a motion to proceed with debate on the GOP health care bill Tuesday afternoon.  After seven years of Republicans vowing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and following  several months  of internal deliberations and setbacks, GOP lawmakers tipped the vote in favor of proceeding with debate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell needed 50 out of 52 Senate Republicans to support the bill, along with Vice President Mike Pence, who issued the tie-breaking vote to allow the motion to proceed. All 48 Democrats and two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, voted against the motion.  Ultimately, the vote came down to two senators -- Sen. Ron Johnson and Sen. John McCain, who is battling brain cancer and returned to the Senate to cast his vote - both of whom voted in favor.   Here is a breakdown of how each senator voted: Republicans who supported: 50 Lamar Alexander, Tennessee John Barrasso, Wyoming Roy Blunt, Missouri John Boozman, Arkansas Richard Burr, North Carolina Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia Bill Cassidy, Louisiana Thad Cochran, Mississippi Bob Corker, Tennessee John Cornyn, Texas Tom Cotton, Arkansas Mike Crapo, Idaho Ted Cruz, Texas Steve Daines, Montana Mike Enzi, Wyoming Joni Ernst, Iowa Deb Fischer, Nebraska Jeff Flake, Arizona  Cory Gardner, Colorado Lindsay Graham, South Carolina Chuck Grassley, Iowa Orrin Hatch, Utah Dean Heller, Nevada John Hoeven, North Dakota Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Johnny Isakson, Georgia Ron Johnson, Wisconsin John Kennedy, Louisiana James Lankford, Oklahoma Mike Lee, Utah John McCain, Arizona Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Jerry Moran, Kansas Rand Paul, Kentucky David Perdue, Georgia Rob Portman, Ohio Jim Risch, Idaho Pat Roberts, Kansas Mike Rounds, South Dakota Marco Rubio, Florida Ben Sasse, Nebraska Tim Scott, South Carolina Richard Shelby, Alabama Luther Strange, Alabama Dan Sullivan, Alaska John Thune, South Dakota Thom Tillis, North Carolina Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania Roger Wicker, Mississippi Todd Young, Indiana Republicans who opposed: 2 Susan Collins, Maine Lisa Murkowski, Alaska Tie-breaking vote: 1 Vice President Mike Pence RELATED: McConnell in last-minute push to win votes on health care Democrats who supported: 0 Democrats who opposed: 48 Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin Michael Bennet, Colorado Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Cory Booker, New Jersey Sherrod Brown, Ohio Maria Cantwell, Washington Ben Cardin, Maryland Tom Carper, Delaware Bob Casey, Jr. Pennsylvania Christopher Coons, Delaware Catherine Cortez Masto, Nevada Joe Donnelly, Indiana Tammy Duckworth, Illinois Richard Durbin, Illinois Dianne Feinstein, California Al Franken, Minnesota Kirsten Gillibrand, New York Kamala Harris, California Maggie Hassan, New Hampshire Martin Heinrich, New Mexico Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota Mazie Hirono, Hawaii Tim Kaine, Virginia Angus King, Maine (Independent) Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Patrick Leahy, Vermont Joe Manchin, West Virginia Ed Markey, Massachusetts Claire McCaskill, Missouri Robert Menendez, New Jersey Jeff Merkley, Oregon Chris Murphy, Connecticut Patty Murray, Washington Bill Nelson, Florida Gary Peters, Michigan Jack Reed, Rhode Island Bernie Sanders, Vermont (Independent) Brian Schatz, Hawaii Chuck Schumer, New York Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Debbie Stabenow, Michigan Jon Tester, Montana Tom Udall, New Mexico Chris Van Hollen, Maryland Mark Warner, Virginia Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island Ron Wyden, Oregon',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Democratic Gov. Jim Justice of West Virginia announced his plans to change his political party affiliation and join the GOP at a rally in Huntington with President Donald Trump on Thursday night.  \"Today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can\\'t help you anymore being a Democrat governor,\" Justice said at the rally. \"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican.\" The New York Times  first reported Justice\\'s plans to switch parties. Earlier Thursday, Trump teased that there would be a \"very big announcement\" this evening in West Virginia, a state that went heavily Republican in the 2016 elections. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin released a statement in response to Justice\\'s announcement on Thursday evening. \"I have been and always will be a proud West Virginia Democrat,\" Manchin said. \"I am disappointed by Gov. Justice\\'s decision to switch parties. While I do not agree with his decision, I have always said that I will work with anyone, no matter their political affiliation, to do what is best for the people of West Virginia.\"  Manchin is up for re-election in 2018. With Justice\\'s move, Manchin will become West Virginia\\'s only statewide elected Democrat besides treasurer John Perdue.  This isn\\'t the first time Justice has switched parties -- he was previously an independent and a Republican up until 2015 when he ran for governor as a Democrat. However, this move could indicate a bigger shift in the state. In Justice\\'s latest  State of the State address , the governor mentioned Trump five times, and said he was good friends with the Trump family. If Justice moves across the aisle as reported, it would increase the advantage of Republican governors over Democrats to 34 to 15.

       " ' (CNN) This week, Democrats  unveiled an agenda for the midterms  that carefully avoided any mention of the issues that had led to accusations they\\'d been playing \"identity politics\" in recent elections. Their message, party leaders said, would be all economics, all the time.  But President Donald Trump is -- and has always been -- a culture warrior.  And he made an aggressive move to elevate those issues to the political forefront Wednesday by announcing via Twitter that he is banning transgender Americans from serving in the military.  It is reminiscent of George W. Bush political adviser Karl Rove\\'s efforts to  push a same-sex marriage ban in 2004 . Gregory T. Angelo, the president of the Log Cabin Republicans, said Trump\\'s move \"smacks of politics, pure and simple.\"  This time, though, top Democrats say they don\\'t fear that a political debate over transgender rights will damage them in the Rust Belt. And some Democratic senators running for re-election in red states were sharply critical of Trump\\'s move. \"Democrats need to show -- and can show -- that they can simultaneously fight for a society that is both more fair and more prosperous -- and drive home the fact that Trump is delivering neither,\" long-time Democratic strategist Ron Klain said in an email.  Democrats seen as prospects for the party\\'s presidential nomination in 2020 immediately lambasted Trump\\'s move. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand vowed to introduce legislation to overturn it. California Sen. Kamala Harris called it \"discriminatory, wrong, and un-American.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted that \"patriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve.\"  The Democrats Trump is really seeking to put in an uncomfortable position, though, are the 10 senators up for re-election in states he won -- all of which have more white, Christian voters who polls show are more likely to oppose transgender rights.  Some of those senators also attacked Trump\\'s decision.  \"If a service member can do the job and is willing, they should be able to serve -- and they should be able to be open about who they are,\" said North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, among the Democrats facing the toughest re-election battles in 2018. \"Decisions about military force posture and readiness are matters of life and death that should be among the most seriously considered by a president, and motivated by the best military judgment of the armed forces -- not by politics,\" Heitkamp said. Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly cited Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby\\'s criticism of Trump\\'s transgender military service ban.  \"When the stakes are as high as the safety and security of the United States, we should always have an open door for the best, most talented patriots,\" Donnelly said in a statement. \"Military service should be about abilities, integrity, and performance, and I agree with my Republican colleague Sen. Shelby that everybody should be treated fairly and given a chance to serve.\" \"The decision announced by the administration today will prevent highly qualified, patriotic Americans from serving in our military,\" said Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey.  Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown sounded a similar note, saying: \"We should not turn away anyone who is willing and able to serve this country and help keep American safe.\"  Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, tweeted: \"A ban against any patriotic American who wants to serve our country is wrong.\" Democrats have at least two major recent data points that suggest the political tide has shifted on LGBT issues.  In Wisconsin -- one of the states Trump won that is holding a Senate contest in 2018 -- Baldwin, who became the first openly gay senator when she won the seat in 2012, is running for re-election.  And in North Carolina, the economic backlash against Republicans\\' transgender bathroom bill played a central role in GOP Gov. Pat McCrory\\'s loss in his re-election bid in 2016.  Trump himself had campaigned on a promise to protect LGBT Americans -- although it was always through the lens of defending them from \"radical Islam,\" rather than civil rights.  \"This will become the latest example for voters that the GOP agenda is about keeping their most extreme base happy to protect Trump, not about delivering on the things people care about so we protect the middle class,\" said Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson. \"If they think voters will reward them for an agenda that discriminates against people by firing thousands of them who want to protect our country instead of getting results on health care and the economy, they\\'re tragically misreading America,\" he said.  In a sign that the politics of the issue might not be in Trump\\'s favor, Republicans in purple states, including Arizona Sen. John McCain, criticized his broad tweets that left unanswered questions about whether thousands of transgender people currently serving in the military will be kicked out.  Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill  tweeted a link to McCain\\'s statement  and added, \"What he said.\" West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin also cited McCain. \"I agree with Sen. McCain that \\'any American who wants to serve our country and is able to meet the standards should have the opportunity to do so -- and should be treated as the patriots they are,\\'\" he said in a statement.  Other Republicans in swing states who are on the ballot in 2020 also criticized Trump\\'s decision. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he agrees with McCain. \"Americans who are qualified and can meet the standards to serve in the military should be afforded that opportunity,\" said Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a veteran. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, told reporters, \"I think anybody who wants to serve in the military should serve in the military.\" ',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Republican primaries -- everywhere.  The GOP\\'s Senate recruiting challenges -- failing to land candidates in some states, attracting too many candidates in others, while two vulnerable incumbents are also targeted from within -- mean the party faces a long list of internal battles. Only after those are settled can the GOP fully turn its attention to unseating Senate Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections.  The across-the-board primary battles are complicating what should be a hugely advantageous map for Republicans. Democratic senators are running for re-election in 10 -- that\\'s right, 10 -- states that President Donald Trump won in 2016. The GOP, meanwhile, only has two members who currently look like they could be in real jeopardy.  At stake is control of the Senate, where the GOP currently holds 52 of 100 seats.  Here is CNN\\'s first Senate race ranking of the 10 seats most likely to flip in 2018:  1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller It\\'s one of the earliest races to take shape -- and it\\'s all bad news for Heller.  Danny Tarkanian, who has lost five campaigns over the last decade but won the GOP nomination in four of those five races,  is taking on Heller in the Republican primary . And Rep.  Jacky Rosen  was hand-picked by Harry Reid to challenge Heller in the general election.    Heller also cast a potentially damaging vote for the Senate GOP\\'s health care bill, sticking with party leadership (and with Trump, who had said while sitting beside Heller at a meeting before the vote: \"He wants to remain a senator, doesn\\'t he?\") Still, that vote could haunt Heller in 2018 -- particularly because it looked like a flip-flop after Heller stood weeks earlier with popular Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval at a news conference and denounced the House\\'s version of the Obamacare repeal effort. He has also delivered confusing and contradictory answers on whether he supports Planned Parenthood funding.  The health care gymnastics complicate what already looked like a tough race. Heller was elected with just 46% of the vote in 2012. Four years later, Nevada was among the only swing states to favor Hillary Clinton over Trump.  2. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill Missouri attorney general  Josh Hawley  is moving toward a run against McCaskill. He\\'s well-regarded by donors and operatives. And now that several Republicans who were widely expected to run, including Rep. Ann Wagner, have decided against entering the race, he could be looking at a clearer field.  Deepening Democrats\\' concerns is that Missouri is rapidly moving rightward. Trump won the state with 57% support last year, and Sen. Roy Blunt was re-elected despite Missouri secretary of state Jason Kander running perhaps the best Democratic Senate campaign of the entire cycle.  The Republican tilt and Hawley\\'s status as a top-tier challenger make this perhaps the GOP\\'s strongest pick-up opportunity.  3. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Just like McCaskill benefited from Todd Akin\\'s now-infamous comments about \" legitimate rape \" in 2012, Donnelly benefitted when his Republican opponent, state treasurer Richard Mourdock, asserted in a debate that pregnancies resulting from rape  are \"God\\'s will.\"   Neither of the two Republicans running against Donnelly -- Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita -- are likely to make such a mistake in 2018.  However, this primary battle will be nasty and personal. Rokita and Messer have already called each other \"unhinged.\" Rokita attacked Messer for moving his family to Washington after being elected to Congress, and criticized a contract Messer\\'s wife has for part-time legal work for the city of Fishers.  Already, it has split Trump world, with Trump supporters in the state backing Rokita while Pence\\'s allies are behind Messer. Democrats\\' hope is that their fight leaves the winner politically damaged headed into the fall.  4. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin If you had any doubt about this state\\'s heavily Republican leanings, Gov. Jim Justice erased it  when he switched parties  at a rally alongside Trump -- who carried West Virginia with 68% of the vote -- last week.  But Manchin isn\\'t your average Democrat.  Perhaps more than any other senator, he was helped by Trump\\'s victory. A world in which Manchin spent two years casting votes for a Clinton agenda would have put him in much graver danger than one where he has kept a cordial relationship with Trump and maintained his own centrist brand, while enjoying the freedom to oppose the GOP\\'s politically unpopular health care effort.   RELATED - Joe Manchin: \\'Don\\'t give a s--t\\' about attacks Republicans have multiple potentially serious challengers here. That list includes  Rep. Evan Jenkins , another party-switching former Democrat, and attorney general Patrick Morrisey -- whose wife\\'s firm\\'s lobbying work for Planned Parenthood and a pro-gun control group could become a target during an intense primary. 5. Arizona Incumbent: Republican Sen. Jeff Flake Before Flake can even worry about a Democratic challenger, he has to sweat a potentially formidable primary from his own party.  Flake\\'s publication of  an anti-Trump conservative tome  has state treasurer Jeff DeWit and former Arizona Republican chairman Robert Graham both looking hard at a run against him. And Trump, who pledged in the fall to spend $10 million of his own money to unseat Flake, is clearly holding the grudge -- with DeWit and Graham both in regular contact with the White House.  Flake: Trump\\'s immigration plan \\'isn\\'t the right direction for the economy\\' If Flake makes it to the general election, his willingness to criticize Trump could appeal to moderate voters. But Democrats will contrast him with Arizona Sen. John McCain and argue that while McCain cast a vote on health care that actually stymied Trump\\'s agenda, Flake has  voted with the President on key issues .  Still, it\\'s a red-leaning state. And while Democrats expect a strong challenger -- Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton are usually the first names to come up -- they don\\'t have one yet.  6. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Tester is up for re-election in a state where Trump won 56% of the vote. So it seemed like a major pickup opportunity for Republicans -- that is, until Greg Gianforte  body-slammed a reporter  on the eve of his special election victory in a House race. You\\'re saying: Wait, what?  Here\\'s how it\\'s all connected: Gianforte was a top prospect to run for Montana governor in 2020. But after his body-slam of The Guardian\\'s Ben Jacobs, he\\'s seen politically as damaged goods. So Montana attorney general Tim Fox -- who was likely to run against Tester -- now has his eyes on the governor\\'s office instead.  Republicans already lost their top Montana recruit when Rep. Ryan Zinke  was named Trump\\'s interior secretary . Fox\\'s decision not to run against Tester -- again, because he\\'s eyeing the governor\\'s office instead -- cost the GOP their second-best option.  Now, Republicans have turned to state auditor Matt Rosendale to take on Tester in the battle of the two best flat-tops in politics.  Something to watch with Rosendale: Billings Judge Russell Fagg, who is considering entering the race, recently  took a shot  at Rosendale for moving from Maryland to Montana 16 years ago -- saying his own \"four generations of Montana roots, all the way back to the late 1800s\" make him better qualified to represent the state. 7. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp On paper, it seems Heitkamp ought to be at the very top of this list. She\\'s a Democrat who barely eked out a victory in 2012 running for re-election in a state where Trump won 64% of the vote.  However, Heitkamp -- who hasn\\'t officially announced she\\'s running for re-election herself, but is fundraising like a candidate -- has $3 million in the bank, she\\'s held events all across a state with a small enough population that retail politics works, and she doesn\\'t have a Republican opponent.  The most buzzed-about prospects are state Sen. Tom Campbell and Rep. Kevin Cramer. But until one -- or another Republican with a profile in North Dakota and/or money to spend -- jumps in, Heitkamp is in a strong position.  8. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Unseating Baldwin didn\\'t get any easier when Rep. Sean Duffy, perhaps Republicans\\' strongest potential recruit, decided against running.  So far, Marine Corps veteran and businessman Kevin Nicholson is in the race, while state Sen. Leah Vukmir, businessman Eric Hovde and others are weighing bids of their own.  Boosting Republicans\\' prospects here is a strong, battle-tested party built by Gov. Scott Walker, who has won three gubernatorial elections already.   9. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown The well-known Brown\\'s populist, anti-free trade brand fits Ohio\\'s white working-class voters better than Hillary Clinton\\'s message did in 2016. But this is still a state where Trump won by 9 percentage points. Brown is headed into a likely rematch against state treasurer Josh Mandel. Why this is a precarious race for Brown: Mandel has $3.3 million in the bank and national Republicans have shown they are willing to spend heavily on Ohio -- even to back a candidate they don\\'t love.  10. Florida Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson This one\\'s all about Florida Gov. Rick Scott. In an extraordinarily expensive state, Scott -- whose term as governor ends next year -- could pump tens of millions of his own dollars into a race against the tough, well-known incumbent Nelson. Scott is clearly interested in maintaining a voice in national politics. In May, he launched his \"New Republican\" super PAC. And Trump has lobbied Scott to run against Nelson.  The question is whether the two-term executive is interested in being just one of 100 -- and the junior senator to Florida\\'s Marco Rubio.  If Scott enters the race, this one rockets up the list. Honorable mention In Pennsylvania, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is waiting to see how the Republican field shakes out in a state Trump narrowly won in 2016. Meanwhile, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was actually outraised by Democratic Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke in 2017\\'s second quarter -- showing that, if things really break right for Democrats, O\\'Rourke could be an online fundraising darling headed into the fall of 2018. ',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Senate Republicans tried to troll their Democratic colleagues into revealing an intra-party rift and casting potentially politically damaging votes for single-payer health insurance on Thursday.  Democrats didn\\'t take the bait.  In a purely political move, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines offered an amendment to the GOP\\'s Obamacare repeal bill Thursday that mirrored, word-for-word, the single-payer insurance program that Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, has proposed. Instead, Democrats -- led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who plans to soon introduce his own single-payer \"Medicare-for-all\" plan, which is expected to draw Democratic co-sponsors -- decried the GOP\\'s handling of the process of overhauling the nation\\'s health care system and largely voted \"present.\"  The idea, however, does have support among leading Democrats, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Gillibrand, both potential 2020 presidential candidates.  A handful of red-state Democrats -- North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and Montana Sen. Jon Tester -- as well as Maine independent Sen. Angus King, voted \"no.\" No one voted in favor of the measure, which failed on a 0-to-57 vote with 43 votes of \"present.\"  \"I suspect that what Sen. Daines is doing is nothing more than an old political trick, trying to embarrass Democrats,\" Sanders said on the Senate floor before the vote.  \"I suspect it\\'s just a political game,\" he said. \"But I do hope, by the way, at some point within this debate, if we can -- if not, certainly in the near future -- to in fact be introducing a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program. It will be somewhat different than my friend John Conyers\\' bill in the House, but what it will do is say that in America, if you are rich or if you are poor, if you are a man, woman, and child, yes, you are entitled to health care as a human right and not a privilege.\"  Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill called Daines\\' amendment a \"trick.\" Gillibrand said it was a \"sham amendment.\"  Conyers also urged Democrats to vote against his own proposal.  \"The process by which the Senate is considering changes to our nation\\'s health care plan is a sham, and Senate Democrats are right not to take part in it,\" he said in a statement.  Conyers first introduced his single-payer \"Medicare for all\" bill in 2003. This year, it has 115 House Democratic co-sponsors. It would eliminate the need for private health insurance companies and premiums in favor of a payroll tax that would lead to all Americans\\' medical care being covered through the government-run Medicare program. The Urban Institute estimated the tax increases at $32 trillion over 10 years -- though taxpayers would also no longer pay insurance premiums. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, bashed \"single-payer\" insurance on the Senate floor ahead of the vote on Daines\\' amendment Thursday.  \"Another idea, from many other Democrats, is to quadruple down on Obamacare with a government-run \\'single payer\\' system. It\\'s called \\'single payer\\' because there is one payer, or insurer, the government,\" McConnell said.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is an influential figure all over the 2018 Senate map. The problem for Republicans: He doesn\\'t seem interested in using his power for the party\\'s good.  From labeling a top Democratic target a \"good woman\" to tacitly approving of his former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon\\'s aggressive courtship of Republicans to run in the primary against sitting senators, the Trump factor is proving problematic as midterm election season heats up.   Here\\'s a look, more than a year out, at the 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties in the November 2018 midterms:  1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller  Primary date: June 12 In a health care battle that hurt Republicans politically, Heller\\'s reversals and contortions were uniquely damaging.  His maneuvers -- he was against one GOP health care bill, then for another one -- looked like a result of the pinch Heller is feeling from both sides. On the right, Danny Tarkanian -- 0-for-5 in the general election in his runs for office but 4-for-5 in Republican primaries -- says Heller hasn\\'t sufficiently supported Trump. On the left, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen says he\\'s been there when Trump and congressional Republicans needed him.   Nevada was a rare swing state to go Hillary Clinton\\'s direction in 2016. Heller only won by a nose in 2012 -- and the health care debacle makes this state the most likely to flip next year.  2. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill Primary date: August 7 Running for re-election as a Democrat in a state Trump won by 19 points is tough enough. Now, McCaskill faces the challenger national Republicans had hoped to recruit into the race: state attorney general Josh Hawley, who officially launched his campaign last week.  Worse news for McCaskill: At the outset, Hawley seems to have the backing of both the McConnell and Bannon crowds -- making a competitive primary that would siphon away resources less likely.  McCaskill starts from a major financial advantage. She raised nearly $3 million in 2017\\'s third quarter and has $7 million in the bank, to Hawley\\'s $820,000 third-quarter haul. Still, at this stage in the 2018 cycle, she looks like the Democratic incumbent in the most jeopardy.  So why isn\\'t she first on the list? Because of this: You can\\'t yet name a single tough vote Trump and congressional Republicans have forced her to take. It\\'s a reality that helps every Democratic incumbent on this list. 3. Arizona Incumbent: Republican Sen. Jeff Flake Primary date: August 28 If the question was which senator is most likely to lose, Flake would be first -- by a lot. His support from Republicans has so thoroughly collapsed that the question that looms largest is simply whether he\\'ll even appear on the ballot.    Democrats have the candidate they hoped for in Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. But Arizona still favors Republicans, and whoever emerges from the GOP\\'s primary will stand a chance at keeping the seat -- even if it\\'s Kelli Ward, whose history of controversial statements would be fodder for endless attack ads.  For now, Ward is the only Republican running against Flake. And several groups\\' internal polls there show Ward crushing him. But the possibility of other candidates entering before the late-August 2018 primary, and the bigger question of Sen. John McCain\\'s health, add heavy doses of uncertainty to this race.  4. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Primary date: May 8 Donnelly is a ripe target: He gambled entering the 2012 race against Sen. Richard Lugar, got lucky when Lugar lost in a primary to state treasurer Richard Mourdock, and then hit the jackpot when Mourdock flubbed a question about pregnancies resulting from rape in a debate just before the election.  None of the leading Republican candidates this time around -- Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and state Rep. Mike Braun -- are likely to commit such a gaffe.  This is another race that features two major themes: (1) It\\'s happening in a state where Trump cruised in 2016, and (2) Republicans are heading into what could be an expensive, brutal primary.  The first factor lands Indiana high on the list. The second one keeps it from climbing higher -- for now.  5. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Primary date: May 8 It\\'s getting lonely for Manchin in West Virginia.  Trump won the state by 42 points. Then the governor who\\'d been elected as a Democrat stood with Trump at a rally and declared that he was becoming a Republican.  Manchin, a former governor himself, knows his state. He\\'s played the politics of the Trump era well, playing footsie with the administration over a Cabinet post and sounding open to compromise on issues like taxes. Like every other Democrat on this list, he\\'s helped by Republicans failing to make him pay any price at all for voting against their bills. But serious GOP challengers are lining up to take him on, and the D beside his name might be too much for Manchin to overcome in such a conservative state.  6. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Primary date: June 12 Want a 10-second explanation of why Trump drives Republicans whose job is to expand the party\\'s Senate majority crazy? Cue up the tape of Trump, who had flown Heitkamp to his event in North Dakota in early September on Air Force One, pointing her out and saying: \"Everyone\\'s saying: What\\'s she doing up here? But I\\'ll tell you what: Good woman.\" What better gift could Trump give a Democrat running for re-election in a state he won by 36 points?  Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer, who is thinking about challenging Heitkamp, was on stage for that moment, and got no special mention. State Sen. Tom Campbell is in the race. But Heitkamp raised more than $1 million in the third quarter, has almost $4 million on hand and the President seeming to like her is going to matter.   7. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown Primary date: May 8 The 2016 election ended Ohio\\'s status as the marquee swing state -- with Trump\\'s eight-point margin of victory there making places like North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia look like potentially better targets for national Democrats.  When it comes to connecting with voters\\' sense of economic anxiety, the populist, anti-trade Brown has a lot in common with Trump. He also heads into a likely matchup against state treasurer Josh Mandel, who Brown already beat head-to-head in 2012.  This race should be a good test of whether Trump\\'s popularity transfers to other Republicans -- or whether it was really his economic message that won the day in Ohio.  8. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Primary date: June 5 Tester is raising lots of money -- $1.2 million in the third quarter, with more than $5 million on hand -- and railing against \"Washington,\" not Trump.  Yes, Montana was a state Trump won by 20 points. But Gov. Steve Bullock also proved last year that a Democrat can win statewide here. And Republicans haven\\'t yet been able to cast a man with a flat-top who still farms on the weekends as an out-of-touch liberal elitist.  The GOP primary bears watching -- in part because it\\'s shaping up as a proxy war between interior secretary Ryan Zinke, whose wife is involved with Troy Downing\\'s campaign, and Sen. Steve Daines, who is aligned with state auditor Matt Rosendale.  9. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Primary date: August 14 Baldwin is all that\\'s standing in the way of Republicans\\' total takeover of Wisconsin\\'s statewide seats -- and she\\'ll be on the ballot at the same time the engine that drove Gov. Scott Walker\\'s victories in two gubernatorial races and a recall election is trying to win him a third term.  But the Republican primary field is unsettled. State Sen. Leah Vukmir and businessman Kevin Nicholson could pose serious challenges.  One big question: Was Trump\\'s win in 2016 a surprise that\\'ll quickly be reversed, or the tipping point in what had been Wisconsin\\'s slow rightward drift?  10. Florida Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson Primary date: August 28 This is all about Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who can throw tons of his own money into a Senate race that Trump and other party leaders desperately want to see him enter. If he does, this becomes a high-profile race in a marquee swing state, and has all the ingredients of a close, expensive and brutal contest. Scott\\'s handling of Hurricane Irma -- and particularly a nursing home  where 12 patients died  -- would come under serious scrutiny.  For now, this race barely makes the cut. But if Scott gets in, expect it to jump much higher.  Honorable mention Two more Democrats, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, are among the safest swing-state incumbents. And Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow appears to be in good position -- though rap-rock musician Kid Rock (ballot name: Robert Ritchie) wants people to think he might run against her.  In New Jersey, Sen. Robert Menendez is on a different kind of hot seat -- in the middle of a corruption trial.   If a true anti-Trump wave breaks against the Republicans, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could find himself in a competitive race against Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke. And whichever Republican is nominated to replace Sen. Bob Corker in Tennessee -- right now, Rep. Marsha Blackburn looks like the front-runner -- could face a tough test.  One that should be on your radar: Mississippi. Republican Sen. Roger Wicker is likely to face a Steve Bannon-backed primary challenger. State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who nearly knocked off Sen. Thad Cochran in a primary in 2014, is seriously considering the race. Democrats wonder if the GOP primary might turn this state into competitive ground just like Alabama, where controversial former judge Roy Moore faces a surprisingly serious competitor in Democrat Doug Jones in a December special election.

       " 'Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner hosted another bipartisan dinner at their Kalorama home Monday evening, a source familiar with the dinner confirmed to CNN Monday. Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp and Claire McCaskill, as well as Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Mike Lee and Pat Toomey and Treasury Sec. Steve Mnuchin, attended. The topic of the dinner, first reported by  Politico , was tax reform.  In a  Facebook Live  from his Senate office Tuesday, Rubio said he saw \"some glimmers of hope\" for bipartisan tax reform at the dinner. \"It was a bipartisan dinner, and part of the conversation, a lot of the conversation, centered around tax reform, how we can get to a bipartisan solution on tax reform,\" Rubio said.  \"And so we talked through some of those components last night, what would it take to get Democrats on board on this issue versus that issue, and a lot of work to be done there, but I did see some glimmers of hope,\" Rubio said. \"The one thing I think there is some universal support for across the board at this point is the child tax credit increase.\" Speaking on CNN\\'s \"New Day\" Tuesday morning, Manchin said Kushner and Trump were \"great hosts.\"  \"We talked with each other, not at each other. Ivanka and Jared were great hosts. They kept -- everything was moving in a direction,\" Manchin said. \"We really got into some serious content, which I think helped all sides find a pathway forward. And we\\'re hoping we can do that.\"  Trump, a senior adviser to her father, President Donald Trump, is currently  making a push  alongside the White House on tax reform, working to cultivate relationships and build coalitions with Congress. She has met with a wide group of bipartisan lawmakers and advocacy groups in recent weeks to discuss the expansion of the child tax credit.  \"Ivanka wants to see an expansion of the child tax credit as it is an essential part of ensuring a middle class tax cut. She is meeting with members of Congress and advocacy groups to discuss possible proposals,\" a White House official said last week, adding: \"As with other areas of tax reform, the administration has laid out its vision and is now working with the relevant committees who are preparing key specifics.\" Rubio has met with Ivanka Trump multiple times on the topic of tax reform and policies for working families, persuading her to adopt his proposal with Lee to expand the child tax credit.  \"After several meetings and discussions with the senator, she threw her support behind the Rubio-Lee child tax credit to ensure tax reform includes meaningful relief for working American families,\" Rubio spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas told CNN via email.  Though Ivanka Trump also advocated for paid family leave as part of her pro-family campaign trail pitch, a White House official said that that policy \"was always intended to be a separate piece of legislation.\"  The first daughter is continuing to have meetings on the subject.  Traveling across the country on the campaign trail, Ivanka Trump made pro-family policies a hallmark of her appearances. \"As a mother myself, of three young children, I know how hard it is to work while raising a family. And I also know that I\\'m far more fortunate than most. American families need relief. Policies that allow women with children to thrive should not be novelties, they should be the norm,\" she said during her speech to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Trump has frequently used dinner party diplomacy to build relationships. Last week, Trump and Kushner hosted Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Sheldon Whitehouse and Dick Durbin, as well as Lee, a Republican, and other White House officials, for a dinner focused on criminal justice reform.  And earlier this year before she formally stepped into her White House role, she hosted two private dinner parties with business executives focusing on women in the workplace. The first working dinner took place before the inauguration at the home of friend Wendi Deng Murdoch; the second at her home.  Future dinners are in the works.

       " 'Washington (CNN) As the Senate gets ready to make a major move on tax reform, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont faced off in a CNN town hall debate Wednesday night to discuss efforts to overhaul the tax code. CNN\\'s Jake Tapper, anchor and chief Washington correspondent, and CNN\\'s Dana Bash, chief political correspondent, moderated the debate, which was in Washington. Cruz began by defending the Republican\\'s tax plan, and called on Congress to lower taxes overall.  \"Bernie and the Democrats want every one of you watching today to pay more taxes, and Republicans want to lower the taxes for each and every person watching this debate,\" Cruz said. He later said the objective of tax reform should be cutting everybody\\'s taxes.  Sanders said that although he supports \"a tax cut for the middle class and working families,\" he does not support tax breaks for the most wealthy individuals.  \"What this entire proposal is about is to give tax breaks to people who don\\'t need it,\" Sanders said during the debate, adding it would be at the expense of other programs that working families depend on.  According to the tax reform \"framework\" that Republicans released last month, the plan would lower the corporate rate to 20%, reduce the number of income tax brackets from seven to three, double the standard deduction, increase the child tax credit and repeal the estate tax. Many key details are still missing and Republicans have yet to release the full bill, waiting on the Senate to first pass a budget resolution. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady suggested last week that the legislative process in the House would begin soon after the budget was passed. So far Republicans have agreed to a tax cut that would cost $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. While Trump officials and Republican leaders argue that economic growth will pay for the cuts, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, has been adamant that he won\\'t vote for any tax reform bill that will add to the deficit. RELATED: These are the GOP sticking points on tax reform Others, like Cruz, want an even deeper tax cut, believing it will generate even more economic growth. \"I think this should be an unapologetic tax cut,\" he said last week on CNBC. The Senate is set to vote on a budget resolution later this week that will make it possible for Republicans to use reconciliation on tax reform, a process that allows them to pass it with only a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than the usual 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. That means Republicans, who hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate, could pass tax reform without any Democratic votes and still afford to lose two from their own party, with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence. Reconciliation can only be used once each fiscal year, and even though Republicans used it to help pass a health care bill, they still couldn\\'t rally enough votes within their own party to get to a majority. This time Republicans are hoping to get some Democrats on board in case they once again fall short. President Donald Trump has taken his tax reform message on the road to states that he won last year and have vulnerable Democratic senators up for reelection in 2018. It\\'s an attempt to ramp up pressure on senators like Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. RELATED: Democrat Heitkamp to fly with Trump on Air Force One to North Dakota Those three senators also dined with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner  in a bipartisan dinner in Washington Monday night, where the group discussed tax reform, more specifically the President\\'s push to increase the child tax credit, which has broad support across party lines. Don\\'t count Sanders, however, in the mix of potential senators who might side with Republicans. The 2016 presidential candidate described Trump\\'s tax plan as \"morally repugnant and bad economic policy\" in a statement last month, saying it disproportionately benefits the wealthy over the middle class. The goal is to pass the bill by the end of the year, and House Speaker Paul Ryan threatened  last week to keep members in session on Christmas  to get it done. While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Trump also say they want to finish by year\\'s end, both men softened expectations in a news conference Tuesday, pointing to previous administrations that didn\\'t finish major legislative tasks quickly. \"The goal is to get it done this calendar year,\" McConnell said. \"But it is important to remember that Obama signed Obamacare in March of year two. Obama signed Dodd-Frank in July of year two.\" The debate will air on CNN, CNN en Español, CNN International, and will be carried by CNN\\'s SiriusXM Channel 116 and the Westwood One Radio Network. In addition to the TV airings, the debate will also stream live for subscribers via CNNgo (at CNN.com/go and via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Samsung Smart TV and Android TV) and on the CNN mobile apps for iOS and Android. The debate will also be available Thursday via on demand via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms and CNN mobile apps. CNN\\'s Sophie Tatum contributed to this report. ',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Several Hill Democrats are calling for action in the wake of a bombshell  report  that found the pharmaceutical industry successfully lobbied Congress to make it easier to distribute opioids across American communities and thwart the Drug Enforcement Administration\\'s efforts to halt the addiction crisis.  Drug companies -- including Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, CVS Health, and the National Association of Chain Drug Stores -- lobbied for a new bill that made it \"virtually impossible for the DEA to freeze suspicious narcotics shipments\" from drug distributors, according to an upcoming law review article cited in the report by CBS\\'s \"60 Minutes\" and The Washington Post. In a statement issued on Monday, PhRMA, which represents biopharmaceutical research companies, said it had not been contacted by the news organizations regarding the story.   \"With regards to the recent Washington Post & 60 Minutes stories, we want to be clear that PhRMA did not support or lobby in favor of the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act and reports that PhRMA spent $40 million lobbying this bill are unequivocally false,\" a statement read. \"Had we been contacted by these news outlets in advance of their stories running, we would have explained our longstanding support for enhanced law enforcement efforts to fight the opioid epidemic.\" A DEA whistleblower told \"60 Minutes\" the US government slowed down enforcement against large pharmaceutical companies just as the opioid epidemic was taking hold. He said the companies turned a blind eye as the pills flooded US communities while lawmakers passed a law to help the industry at the same time. The sponsor of the bill was Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pennsylvania, the man President Donald Trump  has named to head  the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The bill was signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in April 2016. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who serves a state heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic, called for the White House to remove Marino from consideration for the position Monday morning.  \"His advocacy for this legislation demonstrates that Congressman Marino either does not fully understand the scope and devastation of this epidemic or ties to industry overrode those concerns,\" Manchin said in a statement. \"Either option leaves him unfit to serve as the head of the ONDCP.\" After the report was published on Sunday, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, called for the 2016 bill to be repealed.  \"Media reports indicate that this law has significantly affected the government\\'s ability to crack down on opioid distributors that are failing to meet their obligations and endangering our communities,\" McCaskill said in a statement released by her office. \"I\\'ll be introducing legislation that repeals this law and continue my work investigating the role pharmaceutical distributors played in fueling this public health crisis.\" Both Manchin and McCaskill, however, were among the senators who allowed the bill to pass by unanimous consent in the Senate without even a vote. McCaskill\\'s office initially told CNN later Monday that the senator had taken a leave of absence at the time to undergo breast cancer treatment, though it later clarified that the Missouri Democrat had returned to Congress at the time of the vote. At a Rose Garden news conference on Monday, Trump said he was going to look into the report and spoke warmly of Marino. \"He was a very early supporter of mine, the great state of Pennsylvania,\" Trump said. \"He is a great guy. I did see the report. We are going to look into the report. We are going to take it very seriously.\" Trump added that he will speak to Marino and \"if I think it is 1% negative to doing what we want to do, I will make a change.\" A spokesman for Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley said Marino\\'s questionnaire has not been received yet and, therefore, a confirmation hearing hasn\\'t been scheduled. The bill Marino pushed called the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act, gained supporters from the left and right. Some of the bill\\'s sponsors -- including Marino, Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, and Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn -- all work for constituencies heavily affected by the opioid epidemic, the report said. The investigation said each raised at least six figures in campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical industry: Marino got nearly $100,000, Blackburn got $120,000, and Hatch got $177,000. CNN has not verified the details of the investigation, which was based on interviews with former DEA agents and lawyers suing the opioid industry, Federal Election Committee filings, a review of a yet-to-be-published Marquette Law Review article, and Department of Justice documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. \"60 Minutes\" and The Washington Post are suing for more documents, some of which have been pending for 18 months. Asked by CNN to comment on the article, the DEA said it was working on \"preventing reckless doctors and rogue businesses from making an already troubling problem worse. Increasingly, more and more individuals are facing criminal charges. During the same timeframe, our investigators initiated more than 10,000 cases and averaged more than 2,000 arrests per year. We will continue fighting the opioid crisis and continue to use all the tools at our disposal to combat this epidemic.\" In a statement to CNN, Matt Whitlock, a spokesperson for Hatch, said that while the investigation \"seeks to establish a narrative that, while perhaps fitting for a Netflix original series, simply does not reflect the actual events surrounding the drafting, negotiation, and passage\" of the law. Whitlock argued that DEA and DOJ \"allowed the bill to pass by unanimous consent,\" suggesting that the organizations agreed with the legislation. However, as the Post  reported , then-Attorney General Eric Holder publicly opposed the bill. CNN has reached out to the offices of Marino and Blackburn for comment.  Aside from campaign contributions, the Post report suggests that Marino\\'s staff reaped benefits of a cozy relationship with the drug industry, too. Seven months after the bill\\'s passage, his chief of staff left Capitol Hill to work for National Association of Chain Drug Stores.  Opioid Crisis Fast Facts The law, which was supposed to further define \"imminent danger,\" raised the bar for evidence on the suspension orders on drug shipments.  Former DEA lawyer Jonathan Novak said the result of the bill was fewer busts, and more DEA staff \"auditioning\" for the pharmaceutical industry as opioid deaths and overdoses continued to climb. \"There\\'s no denying the numbers. At the height of the opioid epidemic, inexplicably, [suspensions] slowed down. ... Some of the best and brightest, DEA attorneys, are on the other side and know all the weak points,\" he told \" 60 Minutes .\" \"Their fingerprints are all on the memos, and the policy and emails going out where you see this concoction of what they might argue in the future.\" Trump to nominate Rep. Tom Marino as \\'drug czar\\' According to internal emails obtained by \"60 Minutes\" and the Post under the Freedom of Information Act, Justice ,Department officials said the bill was written by Liden Barber, a former DEA associate chief counsel who left to work for the drug industry in 2011. Barber declined requests to be interviewed for the article.  The whistleblower, former DEA agent Joe Rannazzisi, said he was forced out of the agency in 2015 after being outspoken about the threat of the pharmaceutical industry during his tenure heading the office of diversion control. Marino and Blackburn demanded an investigation into Rannazzisi after he allegedly said the bill\\'s sponsors were aiding criminals, a claim Rannazzisi denied in the report. This story has been updated to reflect additional comment from McCaskill\\'s office. CNN\\'s Sophie Tatum, Ted Barrett and Dan Merica contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Congressional Democrats are eying unlikely bedfellow President Donald Trump as a potential game changer in the push to combat gun violence, pointing to some of his past statements in favor of gun control and his recent deal-making with Democrats. It\\'s an idea loaded with skepticism, but some Democrats -- desperate for any kind of action on the issue -- consider the President a possible wild card in swaying Republicans who have opposed gun control measures. \"He\\'s the key to unlocking anything that could happen on gun control,\" said a senior Democratic aide. \"If Republicans are going to move, it\\'s because he makes them.\" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, said that the partisan climate in Washington has only grown worse since Congress last tried and failed to pass an expanded background check proposal, a bipartisan bill he authored with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey in 2013. Still, Manchin argued that the measure might have a better chance now under the Trump administration, saying gun owners will trust Trump more than they trusted President Barack Obama with their firearms. \"In the atmosphere we have in Washington, President Trump would set the agenda and set the tone if it\\'s ever going to change or happen,\" Manchin said. The White House, however, has shown no movement in the Democrats\\' direction. Top administration officials are urging surrogates to push back on the idea of pursuing new gun control measures, according to a GOP source in touch with the White House on messaging. \"Let\\'s gather the facts before we make sweeping policy arguments for curtailing the Second Amendment. The investigation is still in its earliest stages,\" one White House talking point said. On Tuesday night, Trump appeared to shut the door on gun control -- at least at that very moment. When asked by reporters aboard Air Force One about whether he was open to a discussion on gun control, the President said, \"at some point perhaps that will come. That\\'s not today.\" \\'We are stuck\\' Following the deadly massacre in Las Vegas that left 59 dead and more than 500 wounded, Democrats have sought to bring the gun control debate back to the limelight, while Republicans have remained largely quiet. House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Tuesday he wants to let the dust settle from Las Vegas before moving on to a legislative debate and pointed to a mental health bill that Congress passed last year. For his part, Trump also told reporters Tuesday morning that \"we\\'ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.\" Democrats, who acknowledge they have little power being in the minority, are fuming. \"We are stuck,\" said Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-California. RELATED: Democrats are desperate to do something -- anything -- on gun control While some have taken to less than senatorial language to express their frustration -- \"It\\'s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something,\" Sen. Chris Murphy  said in a statement -- others have taken to sarcasm . \"Republicans have shown how concerned they are about this; they lowered the flags over the Capitol,\" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. \"My, that\\'s going to help keep us safe.\" Democrats consider alternative route Frustrated with their Republican colleagues in Congress, Senate Democrats turned their attention Tuesday toward the President and discussed some of his past rhetoric on gun control during their weekly closed-door policy lunch.  While Trump\\'s rhetoric was fiercely pro-Second Amendment on the campaign trail, and while his sons are known as avid hunters, some senators emerged from the meeting pointing to mixed signals he\\'s given on gun control in the past. In December 2012, Trump praised then-President Obama for his speech in Newtown, Connecticut, after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In that speech, Obama pledged to work toward change to combat gun violence, saying society wasn\\'t doing enough and signaled he would push for both gun control measures and mental health laws. While Trump wasn\\'t specific about what he liked in Obama\\'s speech, he  tweeted  that \"President Obama spoke for me and every American in his remarks.\" Asked by someone on Twitter in 2013 for his take on gun control,  Trump responded , \"Big Second Amendment believer but background checks to weed out the sicko\\'s are fine.\" He also said in his 2000 book that  he supported the 1994 assault weapons ban that was not renewed in 2004.   In his presidential campaign, however, Trump offered a different view, saying in a policy paper that \"gun and magazine bans are a total failure.\" Though Democrats are doubtful that Trump will side with them on the issue, they\\'re not ruling him out -- or at least a messaging strategy to put the ball in his court.   \"If he is true to what he has said earlier, he could be a huge ally,\" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia. \"That he once favored it gives me hope that maybe somewhere down the line he\\'d be in favor of that again,\" said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware. \"I\\'m not optimistic, but I never give up hope,\" said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts. Asked at a news conference if Trump was the only factor that could end the gun standoff, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he\\'s \"the most logical\" choice. And for the second time on Tuesday, Schumer ramped up pressure on the President, partly using a page out of Trump\\'s own playbook: flattery. \"It\\'s really his responsibility to do this. In the past, he\\'s been very reasonable about the gun issue,\" Schumer said. But then Trump ran for president and \"had to do what the NRA wanted him to do,\" Schumer added. \"Now, it would be an act of courage, strength, and popularity to do something.\" Over on the House side, Rep. Mike Thompson, D-California, chairs a gun violence prevention task force and said Tuesday they were drafting a letter to the President, asking him to support their push to hold hearings and a vote on a background check bill. \"We ask him to join us and try and figure out a solution to help prevent gun violence,\" Thompson said. \"That letter will go out today.\" CNN\\'s Jim Acosta and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.

       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is putting himself at the center of a slate of marquee 2018 Senate races.  The White House this week launched a new effort to channel Trump\\'s red-state popularity into Democratic votes for his next big legislative priority: tax cuts.  Trump visited Missouri on Wednesday and plans to go to North Dakota next week as part of what an administration official said is a new commitment to a once-a-week travel schedule to sell his legislative agenda.  If Trump sticks to the new schedule -- and focuses his trips on Democratic senators -- it would be a deeper level of involvement than the President showed during his failed effort to repeal former President Barack Obama\\'s health care law. More broadly, though, Trump\\'s political travel in August was solely to states with competitive 2018 Senate contests.  But one of those states is represented by a Democrat whom Trump has gotten along with at times. And another has a Republican senator whom Trump is determined to oust in a primary.  In recent weeks, Trump has huddled with military leaders at Camp David and is set to make his second visit to Texas as the state grapples with the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey. But the President\\'s political travel has been squarely focused on Senate races.  It started slowly and included a trip west to settle old scores.  First, Trump went to West Virginia, where Gov. Jim Justice announced he was switching parties and becoming a Republican. There, though, Trump didn\\'t attack Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin -- or even mention his name.  Then he visited the states where the two most vulnerable Republicans in the 2018 midterms face primaries from pro-Trump challengers. He huddled backstage with potential GOP opponents of Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake before a rally in Phoenix and then traveled to Nevada for a much less political American Legion speech.  This week, though, Trump took a more aggressive approach when he visited Missouri. He  challenged voters there  to oust Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in 2018 if she opposes his tax push.   \"She must do this for you and if she doesn\\'t do it for you, you must vote her out of office,\" Trump said. \"She\\'s got to make that commitment. If she doesn\\'t do it, we can\\'t do this anymore.\" Next week, Trump will visit North Dakota -- home of another Democrat considered vulnerable in 2018, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.  \"I hope President Trump uses this visit to address the kitchen-table issues that keep the North Dakotans I\\'ve met with across the state this past month up at night,\" Heitkamp said in a statement. \"With low commodity prices, drought-stricken farms and ranches, and the need for a strong Farm Bill on the horizon, it\\'s imperative that President Trump uses this discussion to help all North Dakotans plan for a better, brighter future that not only improves our tax code, but protects our way of life.\"  The White House didn\\'t respond to a request for comment about Trump\\'s travel targeting states with Senate races. And the Missouri and North Dakota trips are official, which means Trump is not supposed to talk campaigns. Manchin, Heitkamp and Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly were the only three Democrats who did not sign a letter this year laying out the party\\'s tax priorities.  The White House approached Manchin this week, too, with Vice President Mike Pence appearing alongside the senator at a West Virginia business summit.  The different approaches -- Manchin with honey, McCaskill with vinegar -- match the tonal differences among the red-state senators. McCaskill has aggressively taken on Trump at points this year, while Manchin has held his fire. ',\n",
       " ' (CNN) The beginning of Donald Trump\\'s presidency began with a threat from activists  to unseat  any Democrat, in any position, who crossed party lines or failed to keep a hard line of liberal resistance against the new administration. Those calls, along with an ongoing and testy internal fight over the direction of the party, seemed to boost the prospects of a bloody 2018 primary season. But somewhere along the way, the grim reality of Democrats\\' position in Washington came into focus -- perhaps it was the travel ban, or the solidarity created during the longer battle to protect Obamacare -- and the party, at least on the federal level, settled into a period of electoral détente. The promised rebellions faded as progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, rededicated his \"political revolution\" to grassroots campaigns and organizing. And even moderate \"blue dog\" incumbents, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, stuck with the base through 2017, deflating  his progressive challenger\\'s campaign  before it could gain any traction.  Still, there is a lot worth watching as Democrats sort out their candidates, and priorities, ahead of the November 2018 elections. Here are a few races, some big and others probably below the radar, that could give us a hint about where the party is headed. 1. California: Feinstein vs. de León vs. the field No, it\\'s not technically a Democratic primary -- California throws everyone, whatever their party ID, onto the same ballot for an open primary, with the top two finishers advancing to the fall election.  That said, the California Senate race figures to be the most compelling Democratic intra-party contest of the coming year, with California state Senate leader Kevin de León the early favorite to advance to a November showdown with incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is all but a lock to finish top in the June primary. (This system locked Republicans out of the 2016 general election Senate ballot, too.) De León comes in to Feinstein\\'s left but will likely split some of the spring vote with other liberal challengers. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer hasn\\'t ruled out a run. Same for another (less) wealthy activist, Joe Sanberg, who is also considering it. Progressive groups are floating some  long shot candidates  of their own and David Hildebrand, a self-described Democratic socialist, could attract support from the left. 2. Illinois governor: Two familiar names and one outsider  A billionaire, a Kennedy, and a little known, progressive state senator are the three to keep an eye on as Democrats gear up for a fight with the wildly wealthy incumbent Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. J.B. Pritzker is the Hyatt heir and venture capitalist with a name familiar to everyone in the region (and a sister who served as President Barack Obama\\'s commerce secretary). Chris Kennedy, son of the late Robert Kennedy, had some practice jabbing at Rauner, assailing his \"so-called turnaround agenda\" as a sleight of hand, and \"part of the narrative that government doesn\\'t work so he has to privatize it,\" in remarks  at the Democratic convention  in 2016.  Kennedy is the early, if narrow, favorite, but Pritzker\\'s overstuffed pockets will allow him to spend (and spend and spend) all the way up to the vote.   State Sen. Daniel Biss might be the most interesting (and left-most) of the three, but his campaign is struggling to break through. In part, that\\'s a money issue. Pritzker and Kennedy are awash in it. Biss is not, and he tripped out of the gate when he brought on Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa as his running mate,  then promptly parted ways with him  after Ramirez-Rosa\\'s support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against the Israeli government grabbed some headlines. The decision dampened Biss\\' progressive cred -- Ramirez-Rosa, a Democratic Socialists of America member, never hid his support for BDS -- and raised questions about the campaign\\'s vetting process. 3. Iowa governor: A big, rowdy tent Perhaps the widest open of the big ticket Democratic primaries, the Iowa race was also the least likely, one year ago, to turn into a national pressure point. If Trump had not tapped the state\\'s now former Republican governor, Terry Branstad, to become his ambassador to China, the field would surely be much smaller.  Instead, there are -- right now -- seven candidates vying for the nomination. And while there\\'s no reliable public polling at this point, the early buzz is with candidates like Andy McGuire, the former state party chairwoman, John Norris, an Iowa political fixture who ran  Jesse Jackson\\'s 1988 campaign there , State Sen. Nate Boulton, and Cathy Glasson, a nurse and union leader who is working overtime to court the Berniecrat crowd. She recently nabbed an endorsement of Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action Fund, a progressive group close to Sanders.  Activist Jon Neiderbach, former Iowa City Mayor Ross Wilburn and businessman Fred Hubbell are also in the mix. But the tone of the debate could be as important as its results. As the Des Moines Register\\'s Jason Noble put it  back in May , \"a crowded and dynamic primary could help the (state) party clarify its message.\"    4. Illinois-3: Blue Dog under attack One of the few incumbent Democrats facing a serious primary challenge on the federal level, Rep. Dan Lipinski, a \"blue dog\" now vying for an eighth term in the House, is generally regarded as one of the party\\'s most conservative elected officials. He is anti-abortion and voted against Obamacare in 2010. This year, he opposed the GOP repeal plan but voted in the House for \"Kate\\'s Law,\" a controversial bill that would crackdown on undocumented immigrants who repeatedly enter the country illegally after being deported. In a district Hillary Clinton won comfortably in 2016, a challenge seemed inevitable. On the flip side, Marie Newman has a profile more in line with the party\\'s recent liberal shift. She was  endorsed by the Daily Kos , the liberal online activist hub. \"The 3rd District is beyond solidly blue,\"  Newman told columnist Ted Slowik  in July. \"We have this Republican in Democrat\\'s clothing inside the district acting as our voice in Congress.\" Lipinski, though, has deep roots in the state political establishment -- his father, preceded him in Congress before becoming a lobbyist -- and has fended off a primary challenge before. He also figures to outspend Newman.      5. Oklahoma governor: It\\'s not impossible! Yes, there are Democrats in deep red Oklahoma. And with Republican Gov. Mary Fallin a term-limited lame duck, they won\\'t have an incumbent to take on in 2018. History suggests it\\'s not a lost cause either, as Fallin\\'s predecessor, the Democratic Gov. Brad Henry, also served two terms. What was a three-way race featuring former state Attorney General Drew Edmondson, State Rep. Scott Inman and Connie Johnson, a former state senator and DSA member -- by far the most liberal of the group -- was cut down to two on Wednesday, when  Inman abruptly dropped out  and announced plans to resign his current post next year.     Edmondson belongs to one of the best known and most powerful families in Oklahoma politics. His father was a US congressman, his uncle a governor and US senator, and brother James is now on the state Supreme Court.   But progressives will be interested to see how Johnson fares -- especially after Inman\\'s departure. An unabashed progressive, she spent nearly a decade in the state senate and, in 2014, became the first woman and African American to win her party\\'s nomination for the US Senate out of Oklahoma.    6. New York: Who\\'s going to take a run at Cuomo? It\\'s been a difficult year, but Gov. Andrew Cuomo is still liking his odds in what could yet be a contentious primary.  Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner, a Cuomo ally turned antagonist who has taken public issue with his strategy for aiding financially pressed smaller cities, is among those mulling a challenge. In August, The Wall Street Journal  reported  that actress and activist Cynthia Nixon, of \"Sex and the City\" fame, was doing the same. She\\'s yet to make a decision, but her name recognition could help build some quick momentum.  Former Democratic state senator Terry Gipson is another potential opponent. He too -- sensing a theme here? -- could attract support from liberal activists and, in an interview with  The Auburn Citizen\\'s  Robert Harding earlier this month, took a shot at Cuomo, saying, \"I am continuing to be frustrated that we live in one of the bluest states in the country and our state government continues to govern as if we live in Oklahoma.\" Bottom line: a tougher-than-expected 2018 primary race could take a potential 2020 presidential bid off the table for Cuomo -- and augur trouble for similar, more moderate blue-state Democrats around the country.  7. Rhode Island: Progressives keep chipping away State Rep. Aaron Regunberg jumped into the lieutenant governor\\'s race in Rhode Island on Tuesday, setting up a showdown with incumbent Democrat Dan McKee.  The 27-year-old Regunberg supported Sanders in 2016 and will have the Working Families Party, one of the progressive organizations that helped lead the successful statewide charge to expand sick leave in the state, boosting his bid. (Regunberg sponsored the House version of the leave bill.) Gov. Gina Raimondo, a moderate Democrat, is expected to win her 2018 re-election bid, so victory for Regunberg, viewed for now as a narrow underdog, would create an interesting dynamic in Providence -- and a chance to see if the party\\'s two poles can get along and run a state government.   8. Maryland governor: Slow start to a big race  Unlike New York, Maryland\\'s gubernatorial primary is both crowded and wide-open. Incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan is a Republican and Democratic voters don\\'t yet have a clear handle on his would-be challengers.  The most familiar names nationally, former NAACP president and CEO Ben Jealous and Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, a policy consultant married to Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, haven\\'t broken through on the state level, according to a  Goucher Poll survey  released last month. Former state attorney general Doug Gansler, who registered the most potential support,  took himself out of the running  a week before the poll came out.  After him, Prince George\\'s County Executive Rushern Baker scored best, with 21% saying they would consider voting for him. Fourteen percent said the same for Jealous; Rockeymoore Cummings fell short of double-digits, at 9%. Mostly though, voters said they needed more info, with 7 or 8 out of 10, depending on the candidate, saying they \"don\\'t know enough to judge.\" Jealous\\' fate will attract the most national attention. Already known for his time running the NAACP, he was among the most prominent of Sanders\\' big-name backers in 2016. He is a former board member for Our Revolution, the political organization spun out of that campaign. Jealous has  their endorsement  and that of the  Maryland Working Families Party  in 2018.  9. Florida-7: A lefty longshot   Down in Florida\\'s 7th congressional district, former ACLU of Central Florida board president and Air Force veteran Chardo Richardson is seeking to outflank incumbent Rep. Stephanie Murphy on the left. Richardson is a longshot still and Murphy has a significant fundraising advantage, but he comes on the scene with the backing of the Justice Democrats, a progressive group launched by Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks. California Rep. Ro Khanna, the young organization\\'s most prominent backer, won his seat in 2016 by knocking off a fellow Democrat, incumbent Mike Honda.  An upset here would signal a big shift -- in the direction of the party\\'s progressive wing -- for Sunshine State Democrats.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Democrats return to Washington this week for a new round of combat with Republicans desperate to deliver on their imperiled agenda. After a long spring and summer at the barricades, pushing back against President Donald Trump\\'s attempts to bulldoze the legacy of his predecessor, the stakes are set. And with 2018 expected to be dominated by heated midterm congressional races, the coming months could be Trump\\'s last best chance to revive his reeling presidency.  \"This fall, the insanity of the Trump era is likely to kick up a notch,\" MoveOn.org Washington Director Ben Wikler said. \"It\\'s hard to believe that\\'s possible, but it seems almost inevitable.\" Here are five questions staring down Democrats as Congress gets back to work. 1. Can they use the blueprint from the Obamacare fight to defeat other Trump agenda items? They\\'re certainly going to try. First up is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era policy that protects undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children. With Trump now  planning to phase it out , Democrats will lean on their Republican colleagues -- with the aid of a furious grass-roots movement that has been mobilizing for this moment -- to pass legislation, perhaps some form of the DREAM Act, protecting an estimated 800,000 people suddenly at risk.       Democrats will have more say on \"tax reform,\" which figures to be front and center as 2017\\'s legislative clock ticks down. Trump has already begun his push. In between visits to flood-ravaged Texas last week, he formally launched the initiative with  a speech in Missouri . Though particulars are hard to come by, Democrats, with Trump\\'s campaign pledges in mind, were quick off the blocks in denouncing it.  Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez warned that any Republican plan would \"overwhelmingly benefit the super rich and corporations over hardworking Americans.\" It\\'s a simple argument and one the party seems poised to rally behind. \"The message war is going to be: Who actually gets the money?\" Wikler said. \"Trump makes this simple because he is a billionaire, his Cabinet is full of billionaires. People get who he\\'s looking out for.\"  Health care, though, is a much more visceral issue, and social welfare programs are famously difficult to roll back. Tax cuts are an easier sell. Democratic lawmakers kept a firm line in the health care fight. But with tough 2018 races ahead, especially for endangered Senate Democrats (more on them soon), defections are a concern.  The plan, as Wikler explains it, is to connect the dots -- back to health care.  \"The way we see it is that this spring, Republicans tried to take away people\\'s health care to pay for a massive tax cut for the wealthy. And they failed. Now they\\'re trying to, one step at a time, start with a massive tax cut for the wealthy, and then take away our health care,\" he said.  As weird and unpredictable as the Trump era has been, and figures to be going forward, an argument over taxes would inject some familiar elements -- and old tropes -- back into the political fray.  \"Like with health care, (the \\'tax reform\\' debate) provides Democrats plenty of opportunities to go on the offensive,\" Democratic strategist Lis Smith said. \"Democrats can reclaim the mantle of being the party that fights for people and define Republicans as the party of Wall Street, big corporations and the very, very rich.\" Republicans have a lot to lose, too. Defeat for Trump on the tax front could set off a round of damaging defections, both in terms of political backing in Congress and in the halls of the White House, where high-ranking officials like Gary Cohn, his top economic adviser, could flee if another top priority fails. 2. Can Democrats sell their own message -- and not get boxed in by Trump? Everybody has a plan until the President starts tweeting. But Smith thinks Democrats are developing tougher chins. \"Democrats (in 2016 and early 2017) fell into the trap of just responding to Trump and being in a never-ending outrage loop,\" she said. \"But with every week and month that\\'s passed, they have been getting smarter about not falling into the that trap.\"  If organizers have a clear idea of how they\\'ll oppose the Republican tax plan, the party is still searching for a bold-faced message to compete with Trump\\'s amorphous but evocative promise to \"make American great again.\" This summer, they trotted out  the \"Better Deal\" platform , signaling a renewed focus on economic issues. Inside the Beltway and in activist circles, the policy prescriptions were greeted optimistically. But Trump\\'s grip on the national political narrative was never in doubt.  So how do Democrats break through? Nick Rathod, executive director of the State Innovation Exchange and an Obama White House veteran, pointed to the \"Fight for $15,\" a union-backed grass-roots push to raise the minimum wage, as an example of how the party can pick up steam despite its deficit in Washington. \"Congress is in perpetual gridlock, Trump is doing whatever, and while I don\\'t recommend taking your eye off the ball federally, where you can actually make change and actually make a difference is at the local level,\" he said. \"That\\'s where I think people should be organizing and working.\" The Service Employees International Union and the \"Fight for $15,\" which it helped launch, tapped Sanders to be the face of a new campaign, begun on Labor Day, to push back against Republican efforts to gut organized labor in the Midwest and Rust Belt.   \"There are only two ways for workers to win higher pay,\" Sanders said in a video touting the effort, which will chip away at anti-labor elected officials ahead of the 2018 midterms. \"No. 1, we\\'ve got to increase the minimum wage. And second of all, we have got to build strong trade unions.\" Sanders is a potent political weapon, one that the party writ large has become increasingly comfortable with as one of its most prominent public spokesmen. Shut out of the nitty-gritty of trying to legislate on Capitol Hill, Rathod argued that Democrats should take a cue from Sanders and quit living in fear of pushback from conservatives.  \"Democrats should stop second-guessing themselves so much and really put forward a broad vision that\\'s bold and pushes the envelope and see what happens,\" he said. \"It\\'s OK for people to poke holes in policy, it\\'s always going to happen. But leading with our values -- big and bold -- is what leadership is about. People will follow that.\" 3. Can Democrats on Capitol Hill stick together and vote as a group, even under siege by the White House? Trump is attempting to make this hard -- particularly on tax reform.  The President traveled to Missouri on Wednesday, where he told voters to oust Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill if she votes against his tax package.  This week, Trump is set to visit North Dakota, the home of Sen. Heidi Heitkamp -- like McCaskill, a Democrat up for re-election in 2018 in a state Trump easily won in the 2016 election.  An administration official said the President has committed to a once-a-week travel schedule that would allow him to leverage his lasting popularity among Republicans to target other vulnerable Democrats.  It\\'s a much more organized strategy, and a more direct role, than the White House used during the health care fight, during which Trump didn\\'t hit the road to pressure Democrats to break ranks.  Democrats stuck together through the legislative battle over health care. They didn\\'t have a vote to spare, either. But tax-and-spend issues could present more of a challenge, particularly if Republicans bundle several items together in a single package.  The three to watch: Heitkamp, Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. They were the three who didn\\'t sign  a letter laying out Democratic tax reform priorities  earlier this year -- and therefore are Trump\\'s ripest targets.  4. Can the party keep the grass roots engaged? The fight to spare Obamacare from the congressional GOP\\'s repeal effort gave the Democratic base a rallying cry and a unifying goal -- allowing older parts of the party\\'s establishment, new organizations like \"Indivisible\" and leftist groups like the Democratic Socialists of America to  line up behind a common cause . The next big clash for the coalition is expected to come over the future of DACA recipients, as the administration threatens to end DACA by March of next year. That could run into the battle over border wall funding, leading to tense December negotiations. But with a shock victory on health care under their belt, don\\'t expect progressive activists to settle for anything less than continued, all-out opposition to the White House. The dangers of straying from that strategy were evident when Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California), in San Francisco last week, said of Trump: \"I just hope he has the ability to learn and to change, and if he does, he can be a good president. And that\\'s my hope.\" The comment drew swift condemnation from some in Feinstein\\'s home state.  \"We don\\'t have much patience for Donald Trump here in California,\" said California state Senate Democratic Leader Kevin de León. \"This President has not shown any capacity to learn and has proven he is not fit for office. It is the responsibility of Congress to hold him accountable -- especially Democrats -- not be complicit in his reckless behavior.\"  The episode showed the swiftness with which progressives will punish any Democratic lawmakers responsible for cracks in the wall of opposition to Trump -- and how critical maintaining that wall is to channeling the grass roots. Which bring us to ... 5. Can the Berniecrats and party establishment stick together  and  iron out a winning agenda?     There are two ways to look at the ongoing, sometimes tedious, always heated debate over the future of the Democratic Party.  One viewpoint holds that the divisions are overblown and that Democrats -- actual voters -- are for the most part pretty closely aligned on policy questions. Many who proudly cast ballots for Clinton last November would happily vote for Sanders in 2020.  And then there is the other, more dire version of events. In this world, Berniecrats are at war with the Democratic establishment for the soul of the party. Sanders represents a progressive push to take power for the working class, while the moderate or centrist wing zealously defends neo-liberal policies (like an embrace of \"market-based solutions\" in place of public programs) that enrich the elite and fuel growing economic inequality. There is a bit of truth in both. The party is at once coming together -- especially on Capitol Hill -- and tearing itself apart, usually over social media, as competing ideologies jockey to keep or seize power in the aftermath of Trump\\'s win and a decade of Democratic losses in the states. Luckily for the Democrats, Sanders is more deft and pragmatic than many suppose. Even as he openly condemns the party\\'s missteps, the Vermont senator is growing his slate of allies in the Senate.  His national popularity  helps -- the courtship process has, so far, mostly bent in his favor. Support for single-payer health care, or \"Medicare for all,\" dismissed by Clinton  in January 2016  as an \"idea that will never, ever come to pass,\" is a good enough bet to be written into the party\\'s next platform in 2020.  Sanders plans to introduce his new version of the bill in mid-September, this time with support from some of the party\\'s most popular and ambitious figures. California Sen. Kamala Harris, like Sanders, an early favorite to run for the nomination in three years,  announced last week  that she would co-sponsor the legislation, which, though dead on arrival in a Republican Congress, has quickly emerged as litmus test for Democrats seeking higher office. Claire Sandberg, a progressive activist and former digital organizing director for Sanders during his primary bid, said the lesson here is simple: \"Organizing works.\"  \"Centrist Democrats are starting to come around on \\'Medicare for all\\' because they\\'ve been the recipients of sustained pressure from their constituents,\" she said. \"This shift is a positive development but also a reminder that it will take exponentially more organizing to actually win.\" For now, though, after more than a year of internecine brawling, even modest signs of détente -- and an emerging consensus -- are something for Democrats to celebrate. Whether it can help vault them back into power is another question.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez\\'s corruption trial is putting Senate Democrats in a bind. His fellow Democrats are eager to avoid the subject of Menendez\\'s bribery trial, hoping that he is exonerated and then he can focus on his 2018 reelection battle in the Garden State. But there is fear inside Democratic circles that Menendez may get convicted and refuse to give up his seat, facing pressure to resign or an expulsion vote in the Senate. If the Democrat were to step aside while Gov. Chris Christie remains office, the Republican would pick a replacement. Yet if Menendez\\'s legal problems worsen and he decides to run for reelection, it could jeopardize a key seat in a critical election year. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday declined to say if he would stand by Menendez if he\\'s convicted. Instead, Schumer said simply that the New Jersey politician is putting up a \"spirited defense\" and deserves to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. \"Sen. Menendez is issuing a spirited defense,\" Schumer said Wednesday. \"We all believe in the presumption of innocence in this country, and Sen. Menendez is fighting very hard. And we respect that greatly.\" Asked if he would continue to stand by Menendez if the New Jersey Democrat were convicted, Schumer ignored the question. Democrats who face reelection in 2018 also are in an awkward position -- especially as prosecutors lay out the charges in a trial that could take weeks. \"We are a country of laws,\" said Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from the red state of West Virginia, who faces reelection next year. \"And I think people should just let this process go through before they come to judgment in any way shape or form.\" Asked if he\\'d continue to stand by Menendez if he were convicted, Manchin declined to say, adding: \"Whatever the verdict is we\\'ll deal with it at that time.\" Sen. Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat who also faces voters next year, also declined to comment, saying his attention has been focused on wildfires in his state. \"I haven\\'t really been paying attention to the trial,\" Tester said. Menendez is currently on trial for public corruption two years after charges were filed against the New Jersey politician and his alleged co-conspirator, Dr. Salomon Melgen. Prosecutors say Menendez acted in his \"official capacity\" to help advance personal and business interests of Melgen, and call the men\\'s relationship a \"corrupt pact.\"  Prosecutors accuse Menendez  of accepting gifts from Melgen, including luxurious vacations and large campaign donations, in exchange for help in government matters, including disputes over Medicare reimbursements.  However, Menendez has denied the accusations and says he and Melgen are old friends, arguing that the gifts are legal. \"I have committed my entire adult life since I was 19 to fighting for the people of New Jersey,\" Menendez said Wednesday morning before entering federal court. \"Never, not once, not once have I dishonored my public office.\" Menendez also requested to modify the trial so he could be present for \"critical votes,\" but  his request was rejected  by the federal judge overseeing the trial.  Menendez addressed the possibility of missing those votes while speaking to the press on Wednesday.  \"Now the Constitution, like any citizen, gives me the right to ultimately assist in my defense in court and I intend to be here every day. The Constitution also gives me the right to cast a vote on behalf of the people I represent in the United States Senate. When the conflict exists if it becomes a conflict, a clash between those constitutional rights, I will make a decision based upon the gravity of the situation and the difference that my vote could make,\" he said.  Sixty-seven members must vote to expel a senator from the body, meaning at least 15 Democrats would have to join the 52-member Senate Republican Conference in doing so.  The governor is responsible for picking a possible replacement if he\\'s convicted. If he is forced out of the Senate, depending on the timing, it could fall on current Gov. Chris Christie or his successor -- New Jersey has a governor\\'s race this year and Christie\\'s term is up in January.  CNN\\'s Sarah Jorgensen and Laura Jarrett contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Three Democrats from states President Donald Trump won in 2016 will join the President on Tuesday evening for dinner as the White House seeks support for sweeping tax reform, congressional aides said. Multiple sources said the White House legislative operation viewed North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and West Virginia Joe Manchin -- all moderate Democrats facing re-election in 2018 -- as \"gettable\" Democrats on an otherwise partisan legislative push to slash taxes for corporations and overhaul the system. Three Republican senators were also due to attend the dinner Tuesday: Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. Two White House officials go to Capitol Hill  The dinner comes as Trump\\'s tax reform point men -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn -- headed to Capitol Hill to solidify the effort. The two had a Hill meeting on Tuesday as part of the so-called \"Big Six,\" a group that also includes four top GOP negotiators on Capitol Hill. Separately, two sources said Mnuchin and Cohn would meet with Republican members of the Senate budget committee. The latter meeting\\'s purpose would be to try kick starting an effort to coalesce around the budget proposal for the coming fiscal year.  Mnuchin and Cohn declined to comment as they walked out of the \"Bix Six\" meeting. Hatch, the Senate finance committee chairman and a member of the tax group, told reporters \"we\\'ll have to see\" if the House and Senate would release one tax plan together or one for each chamber. \"We\\'re trying to put it together so both the House and the Senate can work together on it,\" Hatch said. \"Hopefully we can work it out.\" Asked if it was necessary to give conservatives more details on what leadership is working on in order to assuage their concerns, Hatch demurred, saying, \"That\\'s up to the leadership.\" Hatch announced later Tuesday afternoon he planned to convene a hearing next Tuesday on ways changes to the tax code could improve the situation for business. Establishing a budget proposal would overcome a key hurdle for tax reform, which Republicans must find a way to pay for in order to pass through the Senate with a simple majority vote. Under the rules of the Senate, Republicans can pass tax reform with a simple majority vote only if the plan would not increase the nation\\'s deficit outside of the 10-year budget window. The top negotiators -- who along with Cohn and Mnuchin include House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Hatch and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady -- have been hammering through the details and disputes of the forthcoming proposal for months. Those meetings have ticked up in frequency and have started to branch out to include outreach to the members of the key tax writing committees as leaders attempt to get their members comfortable with the coming effort. Brady is scheduled to brief the House GOP conference Wednesday on the status of the negotiations. It is a crucial component of the process, aides say, with leaders cognizant of the perception that members were left out of the process of drafting the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, dooming it to eventual failure.  Still, aides in both chambers acknowledge the path forward is more difficult than not given the constant tug of special interests, state and district priorities and ideological baselines. \\'We want to sit down with anybody\\' White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the press briefing Tuesday afternoon that guests for the White House dinner were chosen \"by their willingness to want to sit down and have these conversations with the President.\" Asked about the potential for including Montana Sen. Jon Tester, another red state Democrat up for re-eleciton in 2018, in tax talks, Sanders said, \"We want to sit down with anybody who is willing to be serious about real tax reform for this country, about providing real relief for middle class America, and actually looking to make bold changes.\" \"Those are the conversations we want to have,\" Sanders said. \"And I would imagine if Senator Tester wants to be involved in those and is serious about it, we\\'d certainly be willing to have that conversation with him.\" Mnuchin acknowledged the difficulty of passing the massive tax cuts Trump called for without ballooning the deficit. He said at an event hosted by  CNBC  that they might not be able to get the corporate tax rate down to 15% \"given the budget issues.\" But even with an increasingly stacked legislative calendar going into the end of the year, Mnuchin maintained his position that the Republicans would pass tax reform by the end of the year.  Mnuchin\\'s outreach to the Senate on Tuesday would come after his  muddled attempt  last week to mollify outraged House conservatives over a deal Trump brokered with Democratic leaders to tie three-month extensions of government spending and the debt ceiling to hurricane relief funds. Trump delivered a speech in Heitkamp\\'s homestate of North Dakota earlier in September, bringing the Democratic senator  along  with him on Air Force One and calling her a \"good woman.\" Aides say future visits in states that are home to Democratic senators where Trump won handily in 2016 will come in the weeks ahead.

       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is giving his efforts to wrangle red state Democrat support for his tax reform push the Air Force One treatment. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-North Dakota, will become the first Democratic lawmaker to join Trump on the presidential jet when she accompanies Trump on his trip to North Dakota on Wednesday, where Trump will continue his push to drive up public support for tax reform.  Heitkamp is just one of several Democrats up for reelection next year hailing from states Trump won in 2016 that the White House hopes to pressure into backing the tax reform push. \"Both of the Reagan tax cuts were passed by a Democratic majority in the House, a Democratic speaker and the vast majority of Democrats in the Senate including a Democratic senator from the great state of North Dakota,\" Trump is expected to say on Wednesday, according to excerpts of his speech released in advance by the White House. \"If Democrats continue their obstruction, if they don\\'t want to bring back your jobs, raise your pay and help America win, voters should deliver a clear message, do your job to deliver for America or find a new job,\" he is expected to say.   Heitkamp\\'s office confirmed she would join Trump for his speech, but a Heitkamp aide said the senator will not speak at the event. Heitkamp welcomed Trump\\'s upcoming visit to her state in a statement last week, noting that she has \"been pushing for both sides of the aisle to work together in Congress toward permanent, comprehensive solutions that will do away with loopholes and handouts for special interests and instead promote our small businesses, farm economy and energy industries with the fiscally responsible reforms they need to grow and expand.\" Trump\\'s visit to North Dakota on Wednesday  comes a week after he kicked off his fall push for tax reform last week during a visit to Missouri, where he called on the state\\'s Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill to join Republicans\\' tax reform efforts -- and called on voters in the state to vote her out of office should she vote against tax reform. Trump won both Missouri and North Dakota during the 2016 election. The White House is also targeting Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, as another vulnerable Democrat to join the tax reform effort. \"What Heitkamp has said in the past gives us hope,\" one senior White House official said. But while the White House has called for bipartisanship in supporting the push, legislative proposals to reform the tax code are being discussed among a group of Republican congressional leaders and administration officials -- without any Democratic input. Trump met earlier Tuesday with those officials -- known as the \"Big Six\" -- to discuss the path forward on tax reform. Like last week, Trump is not expected to delve into the details of the tax reform proposals congressional Republican leaders are mulling, two senior administration officials said Tuesday. Trump, who will be joined Wednesday by his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, will also continue to frame his tax reform push in populist terms. \"The pipe-fitters and plumbers, the nurses and police officers, all the people like you who pour their hearts into every penny earned in both the offices and oil fields of America, you are the ones who carry this nation on your backs and it is time you got the relief you deserve,\" Trump is expected to say on Wednesday, according to the White House-provided speech excerpts. The administration officials also downplayed any disagreements between the plans for tax reform Trump has expressed in the past, and the direction the talks with congressional leaders are headed. While Trump last week said he hoped to bring the business tax rate down to 15%, that figure has been dismissed by congressional leaders on Capitol Hill as unrealistic. \"The President has been very open about that particular number as something that he\\'s driving toward, but I think we are also -- the White House is working very closely with our friends on Capitol Hill with what that number is going to be,\" a senior White House official said. The White House has turned its focus to tax reform amid a packed legislative schedule on Capitol Hill, which must also reach an agreement to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling by the end of the month. \"How do you spell what the top priorities for the President are? It\\'s what he\\'s spending his T-I-M-E doing,\" the official said. \"He\\'s going to spend a great deal of time over the next months going around the country and selling tax reform.\" This story has been updated.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) When Donald Trump unveiled his tax-reform proposal on Wednesday in Indianapolis, he promised the audience that his plan wouldn\\'t help people like him. At all. \"Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected,\"  Trump promised . \"They can call me all they want. It\\'s not going to help. I\\'m doing the right thing, and it\\'s not good for me. Believe me.\" You\\'ll  have  to take his word for it because there is simply no way of checking to see if Trump is telling the truth about the tax plan\\'s impact on his own bottom line. Why? Because Trump still hasn\\'t released any of his personal tax returns, the first president in modern times to refuse to do so. Related: 4 ways Trump and his family could benefit At a briefing with reporters on Thursday, Trump\\'s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn,  repeatedly refused to address questions about the president\\'s returns (or lack thereof) . \"What I think the American people are worried about is their own financial situation,\" Cohn said in one dodge. \"I think what they\\'re concerned about is when they go to work every week and they get their paycheck at the end of the week how much do they get to keep?\" Cohn\\'s responses are broadly consistent with how Trump and his senior aides have long responded to his repeated refusal to release even a year\\'s worth of tax returns. Trump has said that his most recent return is under audit and that, when that audit concludes, he will release the return. (Trump could release his returns even during an audit, of course, as  Richard Nixon did in the early 1970s .) Soon after he was elected, White House senior counselor  Kellyanne Conway insisted that Trump would not be releasing his returns at all . \"The White House response is that he\\'s not going to release his tax returns,\" Conway said in an interview on ABC\\'s \"This Week.\" \"We litigated this all through the election. People didn\\'t care.\" The White House walked those comments back but Conway\\'s \"gaffe\" clearly had the ring of truth. Trump had defied repeated calls to release his returns during the campaign and clearly is convinced that voters don\\'t care. We don\\'t have any way to prove that point. The  2016 exit poll  didn\\'t ask any questions about Trump\\'s tax returns.  Here\\'s what we  do  know: Even based on the limited tax information that has leaked out,  the President could stand to save in excess of $1.1 billion under his new tax package , according to calculations made by the New York Times. Jesse Drucker and Nadja Popovich conclude: \"Though it would not be reflected on his income tax return, Mr. Trump\\'s proposal to eliminate the estate tax would generate the largest tax savings. If his assets — reportedly valued at $2.86 billion — were transferred after his death under today\\'s rules, his estate would be taxed at about 40 percent. Repealing the federal estate tax could save his family about $1.1 billion, though it could still be subject to New York estate taxes.\" That\\'s a big chunk of change. And it makes clear that Trump\\'s assertion that he would not benefit from his proposed tax cut is not likely true. You can expect to hear lots (and lots) more about Trump\\'s taxes in the coming months as Congress debates the tax reform plan.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made clear he views Trump\\'s refusal to release his tax returns as a major stumbling block in the attempts to get tax reform done. \"It\\'s going to be much harder to get tax reform done if the President doesn\\'t disclose his taxes,\"  Schumer said back in April.  \"For the very simple reason that when there is a provision in the bill, people are going to say, \\'Oh, this is for President Trump and his business, not for the benefit of the American people.\\' Particularly when you have the sort of large real estate business that he has. There are all kinds of tax laws that affect it. If the President is interested in tax reform, he should release his tax returns because it\\'s going to make it much harder to pass it without it.\" That\\'s an important point. As Republicans\\' failure to repeal and replace Obamacare makes clear, the 52 seats the party currently controls in the Senate leaves them very little margin for error. Being able to convince a Democrat or two to be for tax reform would certainly improve the chances of some sort of legislation passing. And, in theory, this Democratic caucus should be ripe for the picking on the issue. After all, 10 Democrats up for reelection in 2018 represent states that Trump won in 2016 -- including five that he won by double digits. People like Heidi Heitkamp (North Dakota), Joe Donnelly (Indiana) and Joe Manchin (West Virginia) sit in states where it would make sense for them to find a way to be for some sort of Republican-led tax reform effort. Trump\\'s refusal to release even a year\\'s worth of tax returns gives these Democrats an easy -- and politically palatable -- out. \"I can\\'t vote for something not knowing whether or not this will feather the president\\'s own nest,\" you can imagine one of these Democrats saying. On tax reform -- stop me if you\\'ve heard this one before -- Trump is his own worst enemy.  His refusal to release any tax returns -- and his administration\\'s shifting stories on why -- badly complicates what will already be a rocky road to turning this bill into a law.   None of that means, of course, that Trump will reverse himself on the taxes issue. He won\\'t. Because he doesn\\'t do that on anything. But, in the process, he\\'s making things hard on himself -- and his party.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) There is a bipartisan effort underway to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. Emerging from a meeting on the first floor of the Capitol Monday night, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana told reporters they are attempting to work with Democrats to see if there is a way forward to fix the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. \"We had 10 or 11 senators who came tonight. I think that\\'s significant,\" Collins told reporters after a meeting. \"What we\\'re trying to do is to get away from the partisanship that has made it very difficult to come up with solution and we\\'re trying to get away from semantics, we\\'re trying to get away from people being locked into a party position and instead raise fundamental questions about how can we move forward.\"  Collins and Cassidy are authors of their own legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, but said that their legislation wasn\\'t necessarily the starting point for any negotiation. \"This was really a meeting to look at all sorts of ideas,\" Collins said. The moderate Republican senators stressed that the talks are still preliminary, with just a handful of Democrats involved. They estimated there were three or four Democrats in the meeting and a few more interested who couldn\\'t attend Monday night. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- both red-state Democrats facing re-election in 2018 -- were spotted coming out of the meeting room. RELATED: The five fights Republican senators will have on health care Also spotted at the meeting were Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Dan Sullivan of Alaska. When asked if any progress had been made in the meeting, Manchin told reporters, \"no, not really.\"  \"There\\'s no way I can vote for a repeal,\" Manchin said. Manchin said there were \"some good ideas thrown out and talked about.\" \"It was mostly to see is there a way forward without repealing. Is there a way forward without throwing the baby out with the bathwater?\" Manchin said. The meeting happened as Republican senators charge ahead with their own working group of 13 members who have been tasked with finding a GOP path forward to repeal and replace Obamacare. Collins and Cassidy said their party\\'s leadership, however, was made aware of their bipartisan effort. CNN\\'s Phil Mattingly contributed to this report. ',\n",
       " ' (CNN) President Donald Trump will continue his outreach across the aisle Wednesday when he flies to Indiana with Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly aboard Air Force One. It\\'s the second time this month that the President will travel with a Democrat up for re-election in a state that voted heavily for Trump. On September 6, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp  hitched a ride to her home state  of North Dakota, where Trump gave a speech on tax reform.   RELATED: At tax reform talk, Trump warns he\\'ll work with Democrats on health care Along with North Dakota, Trump gave a speech on tax reform in Missouri, home of Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, who\\'s also up for re-election next year in a state that Trump won. It\\'s part of a White House strategy to target vulnerable Democrats who could help Republicans push through their tax reform plan. Trump\\'s speech Wednesday comes the same day that Republicans  are set to release some details of their plan . In a move that suggested he might be open to working with Republicans, Donnelly, along with two other Democrats in the Senate, didn\\'t sign a letter by the party to Republican leadership with a list of demands on tax reform. Heitkamp and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- another vulnerable 2018 Democrat -- were the other two who didn\\'t sign. \"It\\'s an honor to welcome President Trump to Indiana, and I hope he has an opportunity to hear directly from Hoosiers on an issue that impacts not only our families but our economy,\" Donnelly said in a statement. \"I believe tax reform should include policies that will benefit working and middle class families, create new jobs, and protect existing jobs.\"',\n",
       " 'The legacy of the Hatfields vs. the McCoys looms large in Mingo County, West Virginia.  Now, in the same mountainous county along the Kentucky state line where blood was spilled and lives were lost in the famed feud nearly a century ago, two new sides are squaring off over serious allegations of repeated sexual assault on two schoolgirls by two male classmates. And there are claims of sham investigations and \"punishment\" that in one case allegedly amounted to  denying the accused an ice-cream break. The case moved behind closed doors Friday at the Mingo County courthouse, where two school district officials and four faculty members made their first appearance in a courtroom for a hearing a week after the state\\'s top lawyer accused them in a civil complaint of concealing alleged sexual abuse at a Mingo County middle school.  West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a request for a civil injunction last week in which he alleges that two female students were victims of sexual assaults over the course of the year at the hands of two seventh-grade boys. According to the filing, abuse of the two 13-year-old Burch Middle School students, also in the seventh grade, took place on multiple occasions between November 2012 and May 2013.  The attorney general says in the filing that two boys would work in concert: one would restrain their victim while the other groped her \"breasts, genitalia (and) buttocks.\"   Most of the alleged attacks Morrisey outlines in the filing took place at the school, except for a class trip to the state capital of Charleston, where one of the girls said she was raped. Names of neither the boys nor the girls have been released, but the attorney general\\'s court filing identifies the suspects as Juvenile 1 and Juvenile 2, and states they are both relatives of employees of the Mingo County school system. Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney Teresa Maynard told CNN that she first learned of the investigation last week after Morrisey filed the request for an injunction. She said she met with the attorney general on Friday and explained to him that her office must be part of the investigation from now on -- and it didn\\'t take her very long to show that she meant it: Maynard filed juvenile charges against both of the boys on Friday.  She would not divulge what those charges were. Maynard has not brought charges against any other parties, but the attorney general did name a handful of teachers and administrators as defendants in the court filing requesting a civil injunction   -- which is not to be confused with the filing of criminal charges.  Attorney General Morrisey declined to be interviewed for this article, but West Virginia State Police Public Information Officer Lt. Mike Baylous explained that a civil injunction -- like the one requested by Morrisey in this case -- is an \"extreme\" court order that is made for the purpose of restraining the defendant -- or in this case, the defendants - from pursuing any conduct that amounts to harassment.  The attorney general made the case in his complaint that he has ample reason to believe that a state investigation would be stymied.  As abhorrent as the allegations are themselves, Morrissey says they are not why he is taking this action; he\\'s doing that because, he said   \"the overall handling of the allegations was inherently flawed and tainted with conflicts of interest.\"  That may seem like an understatement in a 32-page complaint that details allegations of disappearing evidence, connected suspects, sham investigations, deceitful and vengeful administrators, and refusals to cooperate with law enforcement.  Mingo County, going back to the Hatfield-McCoy days, has earned an unsavory reputation, thanks to nepotism, cronyism and a spectacular history of vendettas and public corruption. In the last few years Mingo\\'s sheriff was assassinated, its only circuit judge and prosecutor both went to prison on conspiracy charges in an unrelated case, and a county commissioner pleaded guilty to extortion. Just this week, the mayor of the county\\'s largest city pleaded guilty to lying to federal authorities in a workers\\' compensation case .  Not even the Mingo school system seems to be immune from controversy.  Court filings cite repeated examples of school officials allegedly protecting the accused in the seventh-grade sexual assault allegations, and claim that \"a relative of (one of the boys) was directly involved in the handling and investigation into the allegations against (him), and involved in decisions relating to the discipline/punishment of the male juvenile offenders.\"  That investigation, according to Morrisey\\'s injunction request, was \"ineffective, non-existent, (and) designed (to) illicit contradictory and/or less incriminating statements from the female victims.\" When punishment was doled out, the attorney general characterized it as a mockery. In one instance, for example, a school official \"\\'disciplined\\' (the boys) for the alleged abuse of a female student by denying them a break for ice cream during statewide testing,\" the attorney general\\'s court filing said. The attorney general says the problems go beyond alleged efforts to sweep the accusations under the carpet. Morrisey\\'s complaint said Burch Middle School teachers and administrators \"threatened (the girls) with discipline\" to dissuade them from coming forward, and the alleged victims   were retaliated against when they did.  The day after one of the alleged victims alerted state police in April 2014, she was written up for bullying. Morrisey wrote that the \"bullying\" was actually the victim blocking her Facebook account from the niece of a teacher at the school.  The next day she was written up again, this time for \"insubordination,\" according to the filing.   The attorney general alleges that the other victim says she was targeted as well: the injunction request states that a high-ranking Burch official \"retaliated against (her) by removing her from her classes and placing her in other classes that were below her academic level.\"  When West Virginia State Police showed up at Burch on April 24, the principal refused to allow a trooper   to take a statement from a possible third victim, according to the court filing. The principal \"went an additional step further and informed the State Trooper investigating the alleged sexual abuse at the school that he could no longer take statements from students at Burch Middle School because it \\'disrupted the learning environment.\\'\"  CNN tried repeatedly to reach the teachers and administrators at Burch Middle School named in the filing for comment on the allegations, but multiple e-mails and phone messages were never returned. Jason Long, the attorney representing the Mingo County Board of Education and the Mingo County school superintendent, released a statement that said \"the Mingo County Board of Education is committed to working with the attorney general\\'s office to resolve this investigation in a timely manner. The hearing today gathered everyone involved and opened a dialogue. We take these allegations very seriously. Be assured our goal is to create a safe learning environment for all students of Mingo County.\"  ',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) The deadliest mass shooting in modern American history  thrust the bitter debate about gun rights back to the center of Washington politics Monday -- and everyone reached for familiar scripts. As horror and disbelief rocked the nation after the massacre in Las Vegas that killed at least 59 people and injured more than 500, Democrats demanded more gun control, while Republicans, who oppose new firearms laws, offered condolences and prayers. Liberals voiced disbelief that such bloodletting, this time at a country music festival, had happened yet again. Sen Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts warned on Twitter: \"Thoughts & prayers are NOT enough.\" But conservatives accused Democrats of politicizing a tragedy: \"I just think is disgusting,\" Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said. Much is still unknown about the motivations of 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, who set up a sniper position and rained death and terror on 22,000 revelers from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel on Sunday night.  But the carnage he unleashed is unlikely to sufficiently shake up well-worn gun politics to produce meaningful changes in the nation\\'s gun laws,  even though public support for more regulation typically spikes after mass shootings. In fact, with Republicans monopolizing power in the White House and in Congress, chances of reform appear less promising for Democrats than when President Barack Obama failed to do so after the Sandy Hook school massacre in 2012. The structural impediments to change, meanwhile are formidable. Many Republicans sincerely believe their stance on the gun issue is fundamental to the character of America itself. The National Rifle Association maintains a dominant role in Republican politics, and can also threaten Senate Democrats facing re-election in red states next year. Still, the renewed debate on this emotive issue underlines the ever widening gulf of perception separating liberals and conservatives. Somber Trump  There was one new wrinkle in the depressingly well-worn ritual of Washington reacting to the latest massacre -- a new White House now understands the heart-rending duty of dealing with national trauma. In what might have been one of the most conventional moments of his unorthodox political career, President Donald Trump struck appropriate notes of grief and shock as he called for national unity. If history is a guide, Trump will become weary of repeatedly being called upon to offer comfort after a massacre, an experience that caused Obama to become increasingly contemptible of lawmakers who refused to act. Trump  used his campaign to accuse Democrat Hillary Clinton  of conspiring to subvert the Second Amendment, in a wildly popular play to the Republican base. Barring some stunning conversion, he is unlikely to start pushing for more restrictive gun laws. On Monday, however he strove to reach a wider audience, accepting a President\\'s duty to offer solace at times of national trial. He did not, as he has often done -- for instance, after the Orlando massacre last year -- seek to leverage tragedy for political gain. And while his scripted remarks were a perfect match for the moment, it remains to be seen if he will be as apolitical and restrained after he has had time to absorb the quickening Washington debate over the killings. \"We pray for the entire nation to find unity and peace,\" Trump said. \"And we pray for the day when evil is banished, and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear.\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, meanwhile, choked up  when describing the heroism of concert-goers who used their bodies to shield others. But while the emotion in the White House was heartfelt, the administration showed no evidence that it was contemplating any political shift on guns. \"Today is ... a day of reflection, a day of mourning, a day of gratefulness for those that were saved,\" said Sanders, voicing the familiar GOP refrain that the aftermath of mass shootings is a bad time to discuss gun control. \"I think that there will be, certainly, time for that policy discussion to take place. But that\\'s not the place that we\\'re in at this moment,\" she said. Other Republicans went further. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin tweeted, \"to all those political opportunists who are seizing on the tragedy in Las Vegas to call for more gun regs...You can\\'t regulate evil...\" Democrats mobilize Democrats, now, don\\'t hesitate to push gun control when tragedy strikes. Sen. Chris Murphy, who experienced the Sandy Hook tragedy in his  home state of Connecticut told Congress to \"get off its ass.\" Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts refused to join the President\\'s moment silence for the Las Vegas victims, saying on Twitter: \"it\\'s time for action.\" Clinton, who demanded gun control during her campaign, called  the massacre was \"terrible and sickening.\"  But she also diagnosed the challenge facing Democrats, for whom the issue is becoming increasingly powerful as a mobilizing force in elections. \"Until we change the political calculation for a lot of elected officials and get a much more vigorous campaign ...  we are still just going to be fighting rearguard actions,\" she said on a Center for American Progress podcast. There\\'s little political incentive for Republicans on Capitol Hill or the White House to take a risky move away from the GOP base on guns.  A CNN poll in June 2016, conducted after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando,  found that 68% of Republicans opposed more restrictive measures. Democratic reformers also believe that the immense power of the NRA -- with its intimidating political and fundraising muscle -- is a bulwark against action. \"I don\\'t think the people serving in our Congress and the Senate have the guts to have a frank conversation with the American people,\" Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy told CNN\\'s Christiane Amanpour on Monday. The shrinking middle of American politics makes gun reforms even more uncomplicated. Many conservatives, often from rural states where hunting and gun ownership is endemic to the culture,revere the Second Amendment. They do not believe the mad actions of someone who commits a massacre should infringe their constitutional rights or capacity for self defense. Many liberals from cities and urban areas have never touched a gun or gone hunting, and despair at the government\\'s inability to ban assault rifles, limit magazines and improve background checks. They have more in common with people in other Western nations who view America\\'s gun laws as insane.   In 2000, 38% of Republicans and 20% of Democrats  said it was more important to protect gun rights than to control gun ownership, according to Pew Research. By the 2016 election, the gap between Trump and Clinton supporters on the same question had jumped to 70%. Even so, polls show majorities of Americans in favor of stricter background checks for gun purchases, though it is not clear that would have made a difference in Paddock\\'s case. But a bill sponsored by  Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin  of West Virginia doing just that could not pass the Senate in 2013 in the wake of Sandy Hook. The structure of the chamber meanwhile means that public support for the bill was irrelevant because large liberal states like California and New York have the same voting power as rural conservative ones, like Wyoming or Arkansas. Given these constraints, gun rights campaigners understand that reform will take years and will begin in states and cities.  But that means outrages like the one in Vegas will not swiftly reshape the political terrain.  Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein , a longtime champion of stricter gun laws, was asked Monday whether anything will change this time. \"You know, I thought Sandy Hook would. I thought Columbine would. I thought 101 California would,\" she said. \"None of that did.\" CNN\\'s Ashley Killough contributed to this report.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Republicans and Democrats alike are voicing frustration, distrust and irritation Tuesday with the constant stream of controversies coming out of the White House. In a statement, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain described reports that the President apparently shared classified intelligence with the Russians,  as first reported by The Washington Post  and confirmed by sources to CNN, as \"deeply disturbing.\" \"Reports that this information was provided by a US ally and shared without its knowledge sends a troubling signal to America\\'s allies and partners around the world and may impair their willingness to share intelligence with us in the future,\" the Arizona Republican\\'s statement said. \"Regrettably, the time President Trump spent sharing sensitive information with the Russians was time he did not spend focusing on Russia\\'s aggressive behavior.\" Asked if President can be trusted with classified information, Republican Bob Corker, a Tennessee senator, told reporters \"sure\" and shrugged. The top Republican in the Senate also expressed frustration, but he also said national security adviser H.R. McMaster\\'s comments Monday afternoon refuted the Post report. \"I read The Washington Post story and I read General McMaster\\'s response, which tends to refute the story, rebut the story,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  told Bloomberg in an interview Tuesday morning . \"I think we could do with a little less drama from the White House on a lot of things so we can focus on our agenda, which is deregulation, tax reform, repealing and replacing Obamacare.\" The latest reports that Trump apparently leaked classified intelligence come just as the Capitol Hill was already grappling with the fallout from  Trump\\'s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey,  who was investigating any possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Throughout Congress, members say there are still questions that need to be answered. The leaders of Senate intelligence committee -- chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and ranking Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia -- publicly requested Tuesday more information from Trump\\'s White House \"on recent reports about alleged dissemination of intelligence information.\" And members of the House intelligence committee are meeting with CIA Director Mike Pompeo.  Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida who serves on the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN that he had heard from the White House Monday evening after news of the breach broke, but he still didn\\'t have complete clarity into what happened. RELATED: The two explanations for Trump\\'s loose lips go from bad to worse \"I have very specific questions and hope they will be answered at some point today,\" Rubio said. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia told CNN he was \"deeply\" troubled by Trump\\'s sharing of the information.  \"There\\'s 19 of us privy to this information. 19 people out of 100. That means 81 senators I can\\'t share info with, at highest classified levels,\" Manchin said. \"I can\\'t share even I come out of meeting and they ask \\'what did you think? What\\'d you hear?,\\' I have to say sorry I can\\'t talk about it.  You know how difficult that is with your own colleagues? So, for this type of information to be coming from the President is deeply troubling for all of us.\" At least one member of Congress bucked his frustrated colleagues. \"I think it\\'s pretty overblown, but I\\'ll have to see,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican. CNN\\'s Ted Barrett, Kristin WIlson, Tom LoBianco and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Washington is gearing up for a busy fall loaded with a number of fiscal issues, perhaps the most mammoth of which is comprehensive tax reform. Leaders from both the White House and Congress have been working quietly for months on the topic. While the White House is eager to get a bill passed by the end of the year, members of Congress have not been so enthusiastic about the timeline. After all, the last time Congress passed comprehensive tax reform was in 1986 -- and that was a feat that took years. From the White House, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will get perhaps the most visible role thus far of his tenure when he acts as a top negotiator for the Trump administration in tax reform. Presidential adviser Gary Cohn and Mnuchin released a one-page blueprint of its tax reform proposals back in April. Among the priorities were consolidating the number of tax brackets down to three from seven, doubling the standard deduction, and lowering the corporate tax to 15%, far below its current rate of 35%.  While a wide number of people will be involved in the effort, here\\'s a list of key lawmakers that will likely come up a lot over the next few months. House ways and means committee: Brady, Neal The Constitution says that \"all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives,\" which has made the House the starting point for tax and spending legislation in the past. The tax-writing committee in the House is the ways and means committee, a powerful group that also played a high-profile role in the passage of the health care bill in the House earlier this year (though it went nowhere in the Senate.) Rep. Kevin Brady, chairman of the committee, has served on it for almost two decades and helped develop and introduce that House Republican blueprint on tax reform that was released last year. And as a former Chamber of Commerce executive, the Republican from Texas had experience seeing how tax policy affects business. Teeing up the fall season of tax reform, he\\'ll be giving a speech on tax reform next week at the Ronald Reagan Center in California.    Also high ranking is the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, who\\'s in his 25th year on ways and means. Before becoming the ranking member, he was the top Democrat on the tax policy subcommittee. Largely considered a moderate, Neal is pushing for Democrats to be more involved.   While Democrats have little power against the Republican majorities in both houses, they still play a vocal part in outlining areas of debate. Plus tax reform is widely seen as a topic that could have some more bipartisan support than health care, so Republicans might be eager to win over some Democrats, especially those who represent states or districts that Trump won. Senate Finance Committee: Hatch, Wyden As the chairman of the Senate finance committee, a panel which oversees 50% of the federal budget, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah is one of the most powerful members of the Senate. Not to mention he\\'s the longest-serving Republican in the current Senate, having been elected to the office in 1976. He lead efforts to establish permanent tax cuts that were signed into law 2015. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, is the top Democrat on finance and a long-serving senator. He co-authored his own tax reform bill with Republicans before, once in 2010 with then-Sen. Judd Gregg and again later with then-Sen. Dan Coats. Wyden is widely known as a deal-maker who\\'s willing to work across the aisle, and he\\'s eager for Democrats to have more buy-in on the drafting of tax reform than they had in the health care bill. Republican leaders: Ryan, McConnell Once the bills clear the committees, the leaders of the House and Senate will have big say in what happens next on the floor. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a former chairman of ways and means himself, has been actively involved in tax legislation while in Congress. The noted policy wonk has been optimistic for months that tax reform can be accomplished this year, and after the Senate failed to pass health care legislation last month, he was one of the first leaders to say it was time to move on to tax reform. He will also be a key negotiator over potential intraparty divides that are likely to pop up between the conservative and moderate wings of the party, especially over the best ways to raise money for tax cuts. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will have that same job of overseeing rifts between his party on policy and deciding how to best maneuver the bill on the Senate floor. He has already announced that the Senate will proceed with tax reform using budget reconciliation, a move that would allow them to pass tax reform with a 51-vote majority and without any help from Democrats -- as long as all but two Republicans get on board. That strategy didn\\'t work so well with health care, when three Republicans  defected on the \"skinny\" bill  to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. But McConnell argued last week that Democrats have shown no interest in addressing \"most of the principles that would get the country growing again\" and said Republicans will have to go at it alone.   \"So, I don\\'t think this is going to be 1986 when you had a bipartisan effort to scrub the code,\" he said. \"Maybe there will be a few (Democrats).\" (It\\'s also worth noting that Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is on the finance committee and will be involved in that markup and approval of the bill in its initial stages.) Democratic leaders: Pelosi, Schumer Again, since they\\'re in the minority, Democrats don\\'t have much power to stop tax reform, though they have some procedural tools to slow it down. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will largely serve as the key spokespeople delivering their party\\'s messaging against Republicans, should things turn into a fight, as they often do. RELATED: Here\\'s Democrats\\' plan on tax reform this fall Schumer led most of his caucus in a letter to Republican leadership last week that said Democrats will not support any kind of reform that benefits the top 1% of earners, adds to the deficit, or goes through the legislative process without Democratic input through hearings. \"Donald Trump campaigned as a populist, for God\\'s sake. It\\'s a different world than it was 10 or 15 years ago. The idea that people will support huge tax cuts for the rich when they\\'re given a crumb won\\'t work anymore,\" Schumer told CNN\\'s Lauren Fox on Wednesday. For her part, Pelosi has been criticizing Republicans for not inviting Democrats to the table this year in drafting tax reform policies and have been painting their efforts as a tactic to hand out massive tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthy, as she said in a statement last month. Democrats from states that Trump won Since intra-party debates could result in the defection of some Republicans (as it did in health care), picking up even one Democratic vote could make all the difference. That\\'s why all eyes will be on these three Democrats: Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana. All three are moderates up for re-election in states that Trump won easily last year, and none of them signed the letter with the rest of their caucus to GOP leadership. The absence of their signatures suggests they are open to working with Republicans in a significant way. They\\'ve already been targets in digital ads from Freedom Partners, a conservative group that\\'s trying to push Democrats from red or purple states to side with Republicans on the issue. While Manchin agrees with the components of the Democratic letter,  he told the Charleston Gazette-Mail  last week that he wouldn\\'t agree to sign it without first seeing Democrats and Republicans trying to work together. Donnelly\\'s office has also publicly stated that he wants to see a bipartisan process for tax reform. Heitkamp, the former tax commissioner in North Dakota, has said previously that she\\'s willing to work across the aisle on tax reform but that any reform \"must support working families, grow the economy, and help create American jobs.\"',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) The terrorist attack in Manchester demonstrates to \"people in the United States of America why we\\'re so intertwined and dependent on our intelligence,\" Sen. Joe Manchin said Tuesday. \"It shows the importance of why we should be working closer together, why we should be giving them the tools they need,\" the West Virginia Democrat said on CNN\\'s \"New Day.\" Manchin added that leaders should \"encourage this interaction that we have among the international intelligence community.\" He praised intel officials \"working with the UK and other allies (who) work 24/7 trying to keep us safe.\" Manchin\\'s comments about the US-UK intelligence partnership resonate in the context of the Trump administration\\'s recent feud with the British spy agency GCHQ in the early weeks of his presidency. After the Trump White House had lumped British spies into his unsubstantiated accusation that he was wiretapped by former President Barack Obama, multiple US officials and their British counterparts scrambled to defuse the tension.  Manchin, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, also spoke to the concerns trumpeted by Republicans about the torrent of leaks that have illuminated the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election -- as well as the tension between the intelligence community and the Executive Branch. \"If those people who have this information that the so-called leaks are coming from, come and leak it to the intelligence committee. Come and leak it to the professionals. Come and leak it to the staff that has the ability to go through the sources to find out if they are credible or not. Don\\'t play them out in the news media,\" Manchin said.  Manchin was also asked by CNN\\'s Chris Cuomo about the news Monday that former national security adviser Michael Flynn would withhold documents and invoke the Fifth Amendment in response to a subpoena by the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation.  The senator responded with a mixture of regret and frustration.  \"For him to take this direction, that\\'s not the Michael Flynn I knew before. I don\\'t know what happened. But I would say to Mr. Flynn, please, Mr. Flynn, come forward and work with us. Don\\'t make us pull everything tooth by tooth.\" More broadly, Manchin urged the Trump administration to cooperate with the investigation.  \"I have said this: if you are innocent, help us let you prove that you\\'re innocent. Don\\'t make us work on the presumption that you are guilty. That\\'s pretty simple,\" he said.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump asked two of the government\\'s top intelligence chiefs to publicly deny evidence of cooperation between his campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, multiple current and former US officials confirmed to CNN Monday. The revelations,  first reported  by The Washington Post, deepen the intrigue over alleged links between Trump\\'s campaign and Russia. They follow the President\\'s firing of FBI Director James Comey and  subsequent statement  he sacked Comey because of the Russia probe. Trump, on his first major trip abroad as President, has sought to shake off the damaging political blowback from the drama, exacerbated by the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller last week. The President\\'s treatment of Comey has raised questions about whether he abused his powers by seeking to discredit the FBI investigation or risked giving the impression that he was obstructing justice, a debate now given new life by the latest revelations. Trump spoke to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Adm. Michael Rogers after  Comey revealed in March  that the bureau had launched a probe into alleged collusion. Both Coats and Rogers were uncomfortable with the nature of the President\\'s request and refused to comply, the sources with knowledge of the situation told CNN. Coats  declined to comment  during a Senate armed services committee hearing Tuesday, that had been previously scheduled. The White House declined to comment on the details of Trump\\'s contacts with Rogers and Coats. \"The White House does not confirm or deny unsubstantiated claims based on illegal leaks from anonymous individuals,\" said a White House spokesperson who declined to be named. \"The President will continue to focus on his agenda that he was elected to pursue by the American people.\" The revelations deepen the intrigue over alleged links between Trump\\'s campaign and Russia, and follow the President\\'s firing of Comey and subsequent statement he sacked him because of the Russia probe. Trump, on first major trip abroad as President, has sought to shake off the damaging political blowback from the drama, exacerbated by the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller last week. The President\\'s treatment of Comey has raised questions about whether he abused his powers by seeking to discredit the FBI investigation or risked giving the impression that he was obstructing justice, a debate now given new life by the latest revelations. But Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, warned that the latest reports represent \"yet another disturbing allegation that the President was interfering in the FBI probe.\" \"If further reports are accurate that White House staff also tried to persuade personnel at these agencies to help get FBI Director Comey to back off an investigation involving (former national security adviser) Michael Flynn, the specter of possible obstruction has grown larger and more troubling.\" CNN reported in February  that the White House had asked the FBI to push back against stories in the press about potential coordination between Trump associates and Russia. Comey revealed in a hearing before the House intelligence committee on March 20 that the FBI was looking for any links between Trump campaign aides and Russia and whether there was coordination between the two sides. Supporters of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton believe that the publishing by Wikileaks of emails hacked from her campaign servers helped contribute to her defeat in November. A US intelligence community report in January said Russian intelligence was behind the hacks, staged to undermine confidence in US democracy. The report said Moscow eventually developed a preference for Trump. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and railed against the investigations into his campaign\\'s alleged ties to Russia. The Post story said a record of Trump\\'s request to Rogers was detailed in a memo from a senior NSA official -- and that memo, as well as any that may be from the DNI\\'s office, would be available to Mueller, the former FBI director now heading the Justice Department\\'s investigation. A source told CNN that Mueller  had been briefed on memos Comey had written about his interactions with Trump, including his recollection of the President asking the FBI to end its probe into Flynn. Congressional investigators have requested copies of Comey\\'s memos and testimony from the former FBI chief himself. One source added that part of Mueller\\'s investigation is expected to focus on obstruction of justice. In that case, Comey would be a witness and Mueller will likely interview him as part of the probe. Potentially complicating that effort is Comey\\'s acceptance to testify on Capitol Hill after Memorial Day. The source says Comey likely will be limited in what he can say now that the Russia probe is in the hands of Mueller. \"There\\'s no way in the world Mueller wants his witness testifying,\" the source said. \"He wants to question him before anyone else does but before that he\\'ll have to go through tons of documents.\" Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, wrote on Twitter on Monday that Comey now wanted to speak to Mueller before he gives public testimony and that a hearing scheduled for Wednesday next week had been postponed. Rogers is also scheduled to appear before Congress this week, but not before either the House or Senate intelligence committees, which have separate investigations into Russian meddling in the election. The House Armed Services Committee has a hearing with Rogers. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said on CNN\\'s \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" that he was as \"shocked as anybody else\" upon hearing the news and noted Coats and Rogers had appeared before the panel earlier this month. \"Might be good to get them back,\" Manchin said. CNN\\'s Dan Merica contributed to this report.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) President Donald Trump may have nothing to hide when it comes to alleged links between his campaign and Russia -- but he is behaving in a way that makes it look like he does. The President is now facing questions about two potential incidents of obstruction of justice: applying pressure on and eventually firing FBI Director James Comey, and separately  leaning on National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats  to publicly deny any collusion between his aides and a Russian operation to disrupt the election last year, according to sources cited by The Washington Post and CNN. Of all the rapid-fire revelations, these could be the most serious. They indicate not just a single decision, but a possible pattern of behavior -- the scope of which appears to be broadening. A key question moving forward will be whether the President or his advisers had intent to influence the investigation into contacts between Russia and his campaign, or whether Trump\\'s actions were solely an attempt to manage a bad public relations cycle. The eye-opening new chapter in the swirling Russia saga unfolded as Trump was trying to recast the political narrative of a young presidency already facing an existential crisis. But as he basked in red carpet welcomes -- and some favorable headlines -- in Saudi Arabia and Israel on his first foreign tour, his political and possibly legal plight back home seemed to be inexorably worsening. Pressure applied Sources with knowledge of the events  confirmed Washington Post reporting  Monday that Trump spoke to the two men after then-FBI chief Comey testified in March that the bureau was investigating whether there had been cooperation between the Russian operation and members of Trump\\'s campaign team. For Democrats, the new revelations added to the rapidly accumulating  pile of evidence that Trump conspired to obstruct justice. They also highlight Trump\\'s decision to fire Comey, and subsequent comments in an NBC interview that he did it out of frustration with the Russia probe. The disclosures over the past few days also include sensational reports last week that Trump told a high-level Russia delegation in the Oval Office that firing the \"nut job\" Comey had relieved \"great pressure\" over the Russia investigation. Trump\\'s critics are using the latest claims to bolster their contention that the White House is sailing into deeply questionable legal waters. The prospect of impeachment, distant though it may be, was once little more than a liberal pipe dream, but is now at the center of many conversations in Washington. Most of all, the sheer pace of the revelations, driven by almost daily reports by newspapers like The Washington Post, The New York Times, and by CNN, has made it impossible for the White House to frame a workable defense -- even when the President was in the country. After all, Trump\\'s administration is only four months old. To have this kind of a drumbeat of scandal and revelation this early in a presidency is highly unusual. \"I\\'m as shocked as anybody else, but it keeps coming,\" Democratic Sen Joe Manchin told CNN\\'s Erin Burnett on Monday night. \"This is coming at a pretty fast pace right now.\" Calculating or naïve? What nobody, possibly apart from Trump himself can know, is what lies behind his actions. But there are at least two possible opposing rationales. The most serious rests on the possibility that Trump does indeed have something to hide -- some past link to Russia or involvement in the hacking scheme either personally or by one of the people in his inner circle. In logical terms, that would at least explain the decision to sack Comey, his comments to NBC and leaked accounts of his conversations with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Such a scenario would also validate Democratic claims that Trump has already abused his powers or obstructed justice, offenses that were at the centerpiece of articles of impeachment against Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. In its Monday night article that first revealed Trump\\'s conversations with Rogers and Coats, The Washington Post reached for another historical analogy that will also trouble Trump\\'s supporters. It quoted Jeffrey H. Smith, a former general counsel of the CIA as saying that Trump\\'s move recalled President Richard Nixon\\'s \"unsuccessful efforts to use the CIA to shut down the FBI\\'s investigation of the Watergate break-in on national security grounds.\" Smith described Trump\\'s actions as \"an appalling abuse of power.\" Trump\\'s West Wing was unable or unwilling to provide any explanation that diminished the impact of the latest bombshell. \"The White House does not confirm or deny unsubstantiated claims based on illegal leaks from anonymous individuals,\" said a White House spokesperson who declined to be named. \"The President will continue to focus on his agenda that he was elected to pursue by the American people.\" But even if Trump is really covering something bad up, his behavior would still add up to an extraordinarily reckless strategy, that no one with any Washington experience would think could ever be remotely successful. Seeking to involve such experienced intelligence and political operators like Comey, Rogers and Coats for instance would almost certainly expose the President to grave political risk. It\\'s no surprise that Comey penned a memo detailing what he saw as troublesome conversations with Trump. An alternative explanation for the President\\'s response to the allegations allows for the possibility that there is no collusion with the Russians, or any nefarious behavior by his aides -- at least that he is aware of -- and encounters with the spy bosses instead reflect a catastrophic oblivion to barriers and protocols that exist between presidents and key intelligence operatives. It\\'s possible that the President\\'s fury is brewed from yet more frustration that he is not getting his due over last year\\'s election victory, and that he feels the permanent Washington establishment, of the media, Washington politicians and the intelligence agencies are victimizing him because he\\'s an outsider. \"I don\\'t think anybody knew what to expect, to be honest with you. But the President isn\\'t a politician and I think you are seeing the good of that and some of the side problems that come with that, too,\" Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said on CNN\\'s \"New Day\" on Tuesday. Trump\\'s fellow Republicans have little choice but to look on at the madcap cycle of revelations and suspicion that is unfolding and adopt the most hopeful interpretation of events. \"It would be troubling for this President or any President to be viewed as interfering or take actions that would be interfering with any investigation and one of the things we would want to understand,\" said Utah Republican Rep. Chris Stewart on \"New Day.\" But Stewart also suggested that Trump\\'s calls with Rogers and Coats could be be more innocent than they appear to many Democrats. \"I think he was asking them to make a public comment on something he believed had come and gone, that is that he wasn\\'t under investigation for collusion. I think he wanted that to be known publicly. I\\'m not an attorney but it\\'s hard for me to believe it\\'s viewed as illegal and technically obstruction,\" he said. Fallout Whatever the explanation, one that may only become clear to outsiders after special counsel Robert Mueller wraps up his investigation, probably after many months, it\\'s clear that the way Trump is handling the scrutiny is making the situation far worse from a political and possibly even legal point of view. It\\'s hard to believe that the President or his White House aides could have settled on the course of action Trump has pursued as a rational strategy to get out from under the Russian cloud that is now choking his administration. When he lands back in Washington early next week he will return to a White House under siege. He will face the blowback from what is already shaping up as one of the most eagerly awaited congressional appearances in decades, from Comey, sometime after Memorial Day. It remains unclear however how much the former FBI chief will say before he has consulted Mueller about his evidence that is expected to allege Trump asked him to shut down investigations into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The latest revelations about Trump\\'s conversations with Rogers and Coats will fray the already tenuous relationship between the President and key members of his intelligence agencies and their capacity to work with the White House. Sources told CNN\\'s Jim Scuitto Monday that both men were uncomfortable with the nature of Trump\\'s request and refused to say that there was no collusion between the campaign and the Russians. \"It goes further in my mind as a member of the intelligence committee than just the focus on the Russia investigation,\" Rubio said. \"I think it goes into the very nature of the intelligence community\\'s work and its ability to work with the executive branch and the presidency.\" With Trump out of the country, the Russian thriller that is gripping Washington politics spun through a couple of new plot twists on Tuesday. Former CIA Director John Brennan was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee and was likely to be put on the spot about what the Obama administration knew about Russian election meddling. And the most intriguing figures of the hour, Coats and Rogers were due to appear before the Senate and House Armed Services committees. Their ostensible topic is budget issues but both men are likely to face a grilling from Democrats over the latest reports about their contacts with Trump. Yet another aspect of the now sprawling Russia mystery is also likely to challenge the White House -- the increasing legal peril of Flynn. The former national security adviser is pleading his Fifth Amendment rights rather than comply with a subpoena to turn over documents related to the Senate intelligence\\'s committee\\'s probe into Russian election meddling. Of course, Flynn is exercising his constitutional rights against self incrimination and his move should not be seen as an admission of guilt. But his action further stokes speculation and intrigue that is damaging to the White House along with an impression that the Russia matter is now having serious consequences for people close to Trump and reaching into his inner circle. After all, Trump was advised by people including former President Barack Obama and his supporter, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie that Flynn was a poor fit for the administration and ignored them. Subsequent events, including Flynn\\'s telling of untruths to Vice President Mike Pence about the content of his conversations with Kislyak, that led to his resignation, at the very least reflect poorly on the President\\'s judgment in offering him such a senior administration post. None of this, for now, seems to have changed the reality that the ultimate threat facing Trump -- impeachment, is a political question as much as a legal one. Despite clear discomfort about two weeks of often barely believable allegations, it\\'s not clear yet that Republican leaders are any closer to cutting their president loose. But the appointment of Mueller last week means that the Russia story is now a long game, and even incremental damage, week by week to Trump\\'s image and popularity could seriously weaken his political position, potentially increasing his vulnerability at the moment when Mueller finally reaches his conclusions.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday issued his long-expected decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate deal. The announcement sent supporters of the deal, companies and other nations reeling, while opponents hailed the move. Here are some of the immediate reactions to Trump\\'s decision to pull the US from the landmark deal. Top Democrats Former President Bill Clinton slammed the move on Twitter, saying, \"We owe our children more.\" Former President Barack Obama issued a statement defending the deal, a cornerstone of his environmental legacy.  The statement said, \"The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.\" John Kerry, who served as secretary of state under Obama, called the move Trump\\'s \"big mistake.\"  He wrote on Facebook: \"The President who promised \\'America First\\' has taken a self-destructive step that puts our nation last.\" Congress Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, applauded the decision in a statement, saying: \"President Trump has once again put families and jobs ahead of left-wing ideology and should be commended for his action.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan called the accord, which was entered by former President Barack Obama in 2016, \"a raw deal for America.\"  Other Republicans by and large praised Trump, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz claiming: \"The Paris agreement would have destroyed $3 trillion in American GDP and killed 6.5 million industrial sector jobs by 2040.\" On the other side of the aisle, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called Trump\\'s move \"a devastating failure of historic proportions.\" Rank and file Senate Democrats joined Schumer in opposing Trump.  Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley said on Twitter: \"Trump\\'s shortsighted, extremist strategy on #ParisAgreement threatens to put American leadership at a disadvantage for generations to come.\" However, Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, expressed his support: \"While I believe that the United States and the world should continue to pursue a cleaner energy future, I do not believe that the Paris Agreement ensures a balance between our environment and the economy.\" Ahead of the announcement, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham had said he hoped Trump would not take the US out of the deal.  After Trump said he would, Graham seemed to look for solace in Trump\\'s call for the US to renegotiate the nearly 200-nation deal. Graham said, \"I support President Trump\\'s desire to re-enter the Paris Accord after the agreement becomes a better deal for America and business.\" State and local Three Democratic governors announced they had formed a \"climate alliance\" in the wake of Trump\\'s decision.  California Gov. Jerry Brown, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that they would work together to cut the nation\\'s CO2 emissions, and invited other states to join. Likewise, a group of 61 mayors signed on to  an open letter  saying they would push for action on climate change at the local level. The mayors included New York\\'s Bill de Blasio, Los Angeles\\' Eric Garcetti and Chicago\\'s Rahm Emanuel, together the leaders of the nation\\'s three most populous cities. Business and interest groups Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk  expressed regret  over Trump\\'s decision on Twitter and said he would exit Trump\\'s economic councils. Goldman Sachs\\' CEO Lloyd Blankfein, a Trump campaign target who has since seen many current and former Goldman employees join the Trump administration, sent a tweet -- the only on his account -- decrying the \"setback for the environment.\" The Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy organization, sent a tweet ribbing Trump for the influence of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, a major opponent of the agreement. Heritage Action, the advocacy arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, supported the move. Its CEO, Mike Needham, posted a picture at the White House of Trump delivering his speech.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Senate Democrats grew increasingly incredulous and visibly frustrated Wednesday with intelligence chiefs testifying at a hearing after Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers  repeatedly said they would not discuss their private conversations with President Donald Trump. Coats and Rogers  said they did not feel the public setting of the Senate intelligence committee\\'s hearing  was an appropriate venue to discuss their conversations with Trump, which have reportedly included talk of the FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. But that did not satisfy Democrats, who said there was no reason for them not to divulge the details. \"Director Coats, you\\'ve said as well that it would be inappropriate to answer a simple question about whether the President asked for your assistance in blunting the Russian investigation,\" said Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat. \"I don\\'t care how you felt. I\\'m not asking whether you felt pressured. I\\'m simply asking did that conversation occur? \"And once again, senator, I will say that I do believe it\\'s inappropriate for me to discuss that in an open session,\" Coats responded. \"You can clear an awful lot up by simply saying it never happened,\" Heinrich later said. \"I do not share with the general public conversations that I have with the President or many of my colleagues within the administration that I believe should not be shared,\" Coats repeated. \"Well, I think your unwillingness to answer a very basic question speaks volumes,\" Heinrich said. Sen. Angus King of Maine, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, picked up on Heinrich\\'s questions, demanding a \"legal justification\" for why Rogers and Coats were not answering questions. \"Why are you not answering the questions? Is there an invocation of executive privilege?\" King asked. \"Not that I\\'m aware of — because I feel it\\'s inappropriate,\" Rogers said. \"What you feel isn\\'t relevant, admiral,\" King shot back. \"The question is why are you not answering the question?\" King also went after acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe for invoking the probe of special counsel Robert Mueller, when McCabe said he wouldn\\'t comment on issues in the special counsel\\'s lane. \"I don\\'t understand why the special counsel\\'s lane takes precedence over the land of the United States Congress\" King responded. Interactive: The many paths from Trump to Russia Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, tried to push back on that argument, asking whether Mueller has told the witnesses they should not testify. \"If you\\'ve not had questions waived off with Mr. Mueller, I think frankly — and I understand your commitment to the administration — but Sen. King, Sen. Heinrich and my questions deserve answers, and at some point the American public deserve full answers,\" Warner said. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein responded that when there\\'s a Justice Department investigation, their default position is not to discuss that publicly. \"Is that the rule for the President of the United States as well?\" Warner responded. \"Because that is what the questions are being asked about, reports that nobody has laid to rest here that the President intervened directly in an ongoing FBI investigation. And we\\'ve gotten no answer from any of you.\" During California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris\\' questioning of Rosenstein, Sens. John McCain and Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr both spoke up to tell her to give the witnesses a chance to answer her questions. \"The chair is going to exercise the right to allow the witnesses to answer the question,\" Burr said after cutting off Harris\\' questions. \"And the committee is on notice to provide the witnesses the courtesy — which has not been extended all the way across — extend the courtesy for questions to get answers.\" In an interview on CNN\\'s \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" following the hearing, Republican Sen. Susan Collins joined her Democratic colleagues taking issue with the lack of answers from Coats and Rogers. \"There was no assertion of executive privilege, and thus I don\\'t understand why these individuals did not answer all of our questions today,\" Collins said. \"If the special counsel Bob Mueller had put constraints on them, or if the President had made the mistake of asserting executive privilege, then I would\\'ve understood their failure to respond.\" She said it appeared the intelligence officials were in a \"limbo\" where executive privilege had been discussed, but not yet decided on. Wednesday\\'s hearing was not scheduled to discuss the Russia investigation, and both Coats and Rogers indicated they might be more forthcoming in a classified setting with an intelligence panel. There was a classified session for Wednesday\\'s hearing scheduled for the afternoon, but the witnesses were not among those supposed to appear. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia asked if they could show up in the SCIF, the secure facility for classified hearings, but Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr said that was not an option. \"I think we need you in the SCIF sooner than later,\" Manchin said.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday that Rep. Tom Marino, a Pennsylvania Republican, has withdrawn his name from consideration to become the nation\\'s next drug czar.  \"Rep. Tom Marino has informed me that he is withdrawing his name from consideration as drug czar,\" Trump tweeted. \"Tom is a fine man and a great Congressman!\" The congressman\\'s withdrawal comes after a joint CBS \"60 Minutes\" and Washington Post  report  revealed that Marino took nearly $100,000 from the pharmaceutical lobby while sponsoring a bill that made it easier for drug companies to distribute opioids across American communities and thwart the Drug Enforcement Agency.  Trump spoke with radio host Brian Kilmeade following Marino\\'s decision. \"He told me, look, if there is even a perception that he has a conflict of interest with insurance companies, essentially, but if there is even a perception of a conflict of interest, he doesn\\'t want anything to do with it,\" Trump said.  It was not immediately clear what Trump meant when he referred to insurance companies. \"There was a couple of articles having to do with him and drug companies and I will tell you, he felt compelled, he feels very strong about the opioid problem,\" the President added. \"Tom Marino said, \\'Look, I\\'ll take a pass, I have no choice, I really will take a pass, I want to do it.\\'\" At a Rose Garden news conference on Monday, Trump said he would look into the report and spoke warmly of Marino. \"He was a very early supporter of mine, the great state of Pennsylvania,\" Trump said. \"He is a great guy. I did see the report. We are going to look into the report. We are going to take it very seriously.\" Trump added that he will speak to Marino and \"if I think it is 1% negative to doing what we want to do, I will make a change.\" A DEA whistleblower told \" 60 Minutes \" the US government slowed down enforcement against large pharmaceutical companies just as the opioid epidemic was taking hold. He said the companies turned a blind eye as the pills flooded US communities while lawmakers passed a law to help the industry at the same time. The bill was signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in April 2016. The law, which was supposed to further define \"imminent danger,\" raised the bar for evidence on the suspension orders on drug shipments. Former DEA lawyer Jonathan Novak said the result of the bill was fewer busts, and more DEA staff \"auditioning\" for the pharmaceutical industry as opioid deaths and overdoses continued to climb. RELATED: Opioid Crisis Fast Facts The slowdown in DEA busts comes alongside a recent spike in opioid overdoses and deaths. The number of overdose deaths related to heroin  increased  533% between 2002 and 2016, and a  Washington Post report  found that fentanyl-related overdose deaths increased nearly 600% in some of America\\'s largest cities over the last three years. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat  who had called for Marino to be removed  from consideration in the report\\'s wake, thanked the President on Twitter following Marino\\'s withdrawal.  He added, \"I look forward to working with @realDonaldTrump to find a drug czar that will serve #WV and our entire country.\" Before Trump\\'s announcement Tuesday, Manchin, who represents  one of the hardest-hit states  in the epidemic, told CNN\\'s Chris Cuomo on \"New Day\" that Marino\\'s bill \"allowed hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people get killed.\" \"Over my dead body will he be the drug czar,\" he said. Manchin said that though the bill was passed with unanimous consent and members of Congress could have voiced their dissent, neither he nor any other member spoke up. \"They probably thought they greased this bill,\" he said, later adding, \"There (was) no dissenting because no one has raised any concern because they think everybody is fine, DOJ is fine, DEA says it hasn\\'t impeded them whatsoever. ... We didn\\'t know about all the people who left and took big-paying jobs for the other side. No one knew about all of this. It wasn\\'t revealed.\" However, as the Post reported, then-Attorney General Eric Holder publicly opposed the bill. He also suggested his own staff didn\\'t flag concerns during the bill\\'s consideration.  \"I am as outraged as you,\" he said. \"How does this happen? My entire staff, you think I haven\\'t berated them?\" Manchin also told Cuomo that he doesn\\'t believe Trump knew about Marino\\'s links to the pharmaceutical lobby prior to the report.  \"It wasn\\'t even brought to our attention,\" he added. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican who sponsored the Senate version of the bill backed by Marino in the House, said he \"feels badly\" about the would-be drug czar\\'s withdrawal. \"Some of the criticism is just false. In fact, all of it is,\" he told reporters on Capitol Hill. \"The fact of the matter is if we have a substance that can help people, physically and emotionally and so forth, with true illness, then we ought to explore that. And I have no problems with that.\" Following the CBS/Washington Post investigation, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill announced she would pursue legislation to repeal the 2016 law Marino supported. Following his withdrawal, the Democrat said in a statement that she believed it was \"the right decision.\" CNN\\'s Dan Merica contributed to this report.',\n",
       " \"At about 4:15 p.m. ET Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any current and future investigations into Russia ties to the Trump campaign. Washington (CNN) Capitol Hill has been dominated Thursday by a disagreement over what, if any, steps Attorney General Jeff Sessions should take after it surfaced that he spoke with the Russian ambassador to the US during last year's campaign. Sessions, a top surrogate at the time for Donald Trump, did not disclose the private meetings in his confirmation hearings in January. Many Democrats are calling for Sessions to outright resign. Others are merely saying he must recuse himself from ongoing investigations into Russia's alleged interference into the presidential election. Republicans are more split: Some agree with their Democratic colleagues that Sessions should recuse himself, but a large group of GOP lawmakers are either evading questions from reporters or instead trying to wade through the choppy political waters without taking a clear position.

       " ' (CNN) Democrats are finally back on the offensive on health care, brandishing an explosive new report stocked with damaging information about the Republicans\\' plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. Their new ammunition:  24 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2026  under a House Republican proposal, while premiums would skyrocket for some of the most vulnerable Americans, including low-income elderly patients, according to analysis released on Monday by the Congressional Budget Office.  Democrats mobilized quickly on Monday to begin lobbing a stream of attacks against the Republican health care proposal, marking a drastic role reversal for a party that has struggled to defend the Affordable Care Act for the past eight years -- and suffered significant political losses along the way. Particularly encouraging to Democrats is the CBO\\'s conclusion that the Republican bill would hurt demographic groups that President Donald Trump tended to perform better with, including older Americans. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the liberal independent from Vermont who challenged Hillary Clinton from the left in the 2016 presidential primary, was characteristically blunt: Thousands will \"die,\" he said, if the GOP bill is passed. \"Throwing 24 million Americans off of health insurance, raising premiums for older low-income Americans, while giving $285 billion in tax breaks to the top 2% is a disgusting and immoral proposal,\" Sanders said. \"Thousands of Americans will die if this legislation is passed and we have to do everything that we can to see that is defeated.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Obamacare is becoming an asset -- not a liability -- for Democrats, even those running in red states that Trump won in November. \"That\\'s because people realize by losing it they are going to be in real trouble,\" Schumer said. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is using the CBO findings to target vulnerable Republicans in the House -- particularly those who have already voted in support of the GOP legislation in last week\\'s committee markups. Between the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees -- the two panels that approved the House GOP Obamacare bill last week -- there are at least a dozen Republican lawmakers that the DCCC view as beatable. The DCCC released a statement on Monday against one of those members: New Jersey Rep. Leonard Lance. In an email titled, \"CBO report shows Lance voted for healthcare bill that would leave 24 million more uninsured,\" DCCC spokesperson Evan Lukaske wrote: \"Now Lance will have to own the consequences of voting for this disastrous bill.\" Republicans had anticipated the CBO report would show that millions of people would lose coverage under the GOP proposal. Lawmakers and aides alike preemptively pushed back on the findings even before the CBO released its study, saying the loss of coverage would be due to people electing not to get insurance because they would no longer be mandated to do so. But the loss in coverage is only exacerbated by other details in the CBO report. Fourteen million fewer people would enroll in Medicaid by 2026 under the GOP legislation compared to under Obamacare. And while premiums on average are expected to decrease, there would be a steep premium hike for older people with lower incomes. A 64-year-old making $26,500 would pay $1,700 for coverage in 2026 under Obamacare, thanks to its subsidies -- but under the Ryan plan, that person would get hit with a annual premium bill of $14,600. \"You\\'ve got to have a moral compass inside of ya. That\\'s just not right,\" said Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \"You can\\'t do that and look at the elderly and look at the poor and look at the people that are addicted that need care. You just can\\'t do that.\" In public, GOP lawmakers and top administration officials vehemently questioned the credibility of the CBO\\'s findings. \"We disagree strenuously with the report that was put out,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said, arguing that the CBO report doesn\\'t take into account other legislative changes that Republicans have proposed. But in private, Republicans are on high alert. \"Oof,\" one Republican official supportive of the House GOP bill said. \"We can recover, but this is not a good look.\" CNN\\'s Deirdre Walsh, Lauren Fox and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.',\n",

       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump delivered a sweeping prime-time address Tuesday without the hiccups and bombast that have put Republicans on edge for months, ticking through his administration\\'s top priorities without distraction and leaving even some Democrats worried.  \"For people not committed to Donald Trump already, he did become presidential tonight. And I think we\\'ll see that reflected in high approval ratings,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who decried Trump\\'s Twitter tirades a little more than a week ago.  \"It was an inspirational speech, widely applauded, as you can imagine, on our side, but greeted with a lot more applause and respect on the other side than I would have anticipated,\" the Kentucky Republican told CNN\\'s Wolf Blitzer. Behind the scenes, Republican lawmakers expressed relief that Trump did not go overboard in his speech. It was a far cry from his inaugural address, where he decried the \"carnage\" he said has beset America. Instead, Trump used a more traditional political tactic of painting a picture of that \"carnage\" -- talking about murders in Chicago and telling the personal stories of people whose family members were killed by undocumented immigrants.  Even Democratic lawmakers said Trump sounded more presidential Tuesday night in his first joint address to Congress -- while acknowledging it offered little in new details and may not have swayed any votes he\\'ll need to approve reform efforts for health care or immigration or a $1 trillion infrastructure package. \"It sounded like the Donald Trump who is maturing into president,\" said Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia who White House leaders have identified as an important target for many of their top priorities. And Manchin suggested Tuesday night he\\'d be willing to work with the White House on any immigration reform, saying, \"I\\'m happy to work with him.\" \"That was the best speech Trump has ever given,\" said another Democratic senator, who acknowledged Trump\\'s controlled demeanor would make it harder for Democrats to fight him if he can keep it up.  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who has developed a close relationship with the Trump administration, appeared ecstatic about Trump\\'s performance. \"I thought it was the best speech I\\'ve heard him give. And like anything else, when you get into a job and you do it for a while, you get better at it, and I think he\\'s improving every single day,\" McCarthy told reporters gathered outside the House chambers after Trump\\'s speech. Trump\\'s style Tuesday was far different than the fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants approach some members of Congress have come to expect. Instead of talking about his electoral victory or voter fraud, Trump sought unity. Instead of calling out political enemies from the bully pulpit, Trump asked for Republicans and Democrats to come together as millions of Americans watched, with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and the American flag draped behind him. \"Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week\\'s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its very ugly forms,\" Trump said. But Democrats still found plenty to fight against in Trump\\'s first address to Congress. Some Democrats booed Trump as he called for a special force that would target undocumented immigrants who commit violent crimes. And one Democrat yelled, as Trump said Republicans should support health coverage for preexisting conditions: \"That\\'s Obamacare!\"  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN\\'s Blitzer it was \"another one of his speeches where he talks like a populist, but the way he\\'s been governing is the opposite -- governing from the hard right.\"  \"The American people don\\'t want a speech, they heard a lot of those, they want action. And the action he\\'s giving them is disjointed -- he doesn\\'t know how to really run a government,\" Schumer said.  Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran in the Democratic presidential primary last year, used Twitter to highlight policies Trump implemented, contrasting them with the words in his speech.  \"When Trump said we need to promote clean air and clean water, I had a hard time not laughing. Today he rolled back clean water rules,\" the Vermont senator tweeted.  CNN\\'s Manu Raju and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Charleston, W.V. (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence doubled down on the Trump administration\\'s health care message Saturday, even reading one of President Donald Trump\\'s tweets from the podium during an event about small business. \"The American people want Obamacare gone, and as the President said today, don\\'t worry, America,\" Pence told a crowd of a few hundred gathered at a construction supply company outside of the state capital. \"He just tweeted this morning. Obamacare is going to continue to explode. And when Republicans and Democrats finally decide to come together and repeal and replace Obamacare, we\\'ll be ready to get the job done.\" Pence promised Trump would continue fighting Obamacare until the \"nightmare\" is repealed. He reverted back to vintage, campaign-trail Pence, reading off a list of promises that President Barack Obama made about health care, such as those covered by the program being able to keep their doctors and lowering costs of health insurance -- promises he says were not kept. Pence\\'s visit to West Virginia comes on the heels of a stunning defeat of the Republican alternative to Obamacare, dubbed the American Health Care Act, in the House. The vice president canceled a previously scheduled trip to Little Rock, Arkansas, on Friday to help with the whip effort.  Pence joked Saturday that he \"could have used a WWE fighter up on the Hill yesterday,\" a nod to the professional wrestling company owned by the family of Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon, who introduced Pence to the crowd. The vice president conceded in the speech that \"Congress wasn\\'t ready\" to repeal the bill and acknowledged that a \"handful\" of Republicans were to blame as well for the failure. Tax reform is next on the administration\\'s list of issues, he said, specifically promising that the administration would lower the corporate tax code to 15% to bolster American businesses. Pence also made a direct appeal to West Virginia\\'s senators, Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Shelley Moore-Capito, to support Judge Neil Gorsuch\\'s nomination to the Supreme Court, saying that even though Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, is threatening to filibuster the nomination, the Senate would confirm Gorsuch \"one way or the other.\"  Senate rules say 60 senators must vote to break a filibuster, meaning eight Democrats would have to join the 52 Republicans unless the GOP changes the rules on Supreme Court nominations through a majority vote. Some in the party have vowed to invoke that so-called \"nuclear option,\" which would then require only a simple majority to approve a Supreme Court nominations going forward.  ',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Neil Gorsuch finished his final day of testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, facing tough questions from Democrats on the panel without ever hinting how he might rule on hot-button issues. Fireworks instead were more prevalent between Republicans and Democrats on the committee, who lobbed accusations against each other of politicizing the Supreme Court nomination process. Gorsuch, however, came out of the gauntlet with barely a scratch. Democrats poked and prodded, attempting to get a better understanding of his personal views and how they would affect his potential court rulings. But the 49-year-old federal judge was unwavering, yielding little fodder that could derail his nomination. Even one of his fiercest Democratic questioners on the committee seemed to suggest Gorsuch\\'s confirmation was inevitable. \"This is probably the last time you\\'ll pay attention to me,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island said. \"I am not likely to appear before the court unless things should change fairly dramatically. I have argued in the Supreme Court, but some time ago.\" Though Gorsuch did well in the hearings, it doesn\\'t necessarily mean he won over his critics. It\\'s unclear yet how things will shake out in the full Senate after Gorsuch gets a committee vote.  Democrats on the panel expressed great frustration with Gorsuch, saying he was not being forthcoming enough in his answers. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, for one, said at the end that he \"remained troubled\" by Gorsuch not revealing his views about certain cases. Sen. Mazie Hirono told Gorsuch she wished the hearing had been more \"illuminating,\" saying she\\'s left to judge his qualifications based on what he \"refused to say.\"   RELATED: Gorsuch forced to defend decision in frozen trucking case Still, the hearings went into a third round Wednesday night, but Republicans gave back most of their time and even some Democrats gave back some of their allotted 15 minutes. Audience seats were half-empty by then -- and the hearing didn\\'t see one protester all week.  It was yet another sign that Gorsuch\\'s nomination could potentially avoid a knock-down-drag-out brawl in the Senate. Republicans have 52 senators, and need the support of eight Democrats to avoid a filibuster in the full Senate.  The Republican National Committee announced a six-figure ad buy targeting 12 Democratic senators from mostly states that President Donald Trump won, in part  urging voters  to call their senators and demand an up-or-down vote for Gorsuch in the Senate.   Sen. Joe Manchin, one of those Democrats, stopped by the hearing Wednesday afternoon. The West Virginia senator said he\\'s still keeping an open mind and requested a second meeting with Gorsuch next week.  Manchin said Gorsuch was \"pretty solid\" from what he saw in the hearings and offered some tough love for some of his Democratic colleagues when it comes to considering the Supreme Court pick.  \"I need to tell them every now and then that we lost, the Democrats lost the presidential election. You\\'re not going to get someone of your preference,\" he said. \"You get someone you can live with and someone who has good character and good stature -- and can you go that direction? Does that prevent the 60-rule threshold to be broken? There\\'s a lot of considerations there.\" While Gorsuch is finished with appearing before the committee, witnesses will testify on his behalf before the committee on Thursday.  Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley announced he expects the committee will vote on Gorsuch\\'s nomination April 3. The nominee himself -- who remained steadfastly polite throughout the hearings -- interrupted the final round of questions to ask if he could say his \"thank yous\" before any senators had to leave early. Gorsuch recalled individual meetings he held with 72 senators over the past six weeks and thanked the lawmakers for their \"courtesies.\" \"I wish the American people could see what I\\'ve seen,\" he said. \"I think that if they had seen what I\\'ve seen, they\\'d be much bigger believers in their government than they are. It\\'s not perfect, my branch isn\\'t perfect, but I\\'m a believer in it and I want to thank you.\" Republicans, Democrats square off  Gorsuch faced long days of grilling -- including an 11-hour hearing on Tuesday -- answering questions on a range of issues, from his previous rulings to the President\\'s attacks on the judiciary. While tense exchanges between Gorsuch and Democrats were minimal, Democrats still grew irritated by his refusal to opine on certain issues.  Democrats also hammered Republicans for blocking a vote on President Barack Obama\\'s nominee to the Supreme Court last year so they could keep the seat open until a new president was inaugurated. It was a topic that came up throughout the week, with one senator flat-out telling Gorsuch he thought Merrick Garland was more qualified than Gorsuch. Republicans, in turn, accused their Democratic colleagues of applying a double standard, saying they\\'ve been quick to criticize Gorsuch -- a federal judge -- yet at the same time condemn Trump\\'s attacks on federal judges -- something Democrats did repeatedly when trying to get Gorsuch to comment on the President\\'s rhetoric.  Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, used a chunk of his time Wednesday to read off a list of attacks against Gorsuch by high-profile Democrats, including some on the committee. \"My colleagues, the Democrats, have a right to engage in whatever attacks they chose. But it\\'s a little rich for them to be maligning a sitting federal judge and at the same time giving speeches about how unacceptable it is for anyone to criticize a federal judge,\" he said. \"You can\\'t have both at the same time.\"  Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, clarified that he wasn\\'t defending Trump\\'s attacks, but said he found Democrats\\' rhetoric about Gorsuch\\'s previous rulings \"ironic\" and \"quite troubling.\" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, called it \"absurd.\" Earlier Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, bemoaned that the confirmation process has become too politicized and specifically targeted Democrats for trying to get Gorsuch to state his personal views. \"What\\'s happened? Did the Constitution change? I don\\'t think so. I think politics has changed. I think it\\'s changed in a fashion that we should all be ashamed of as senators, and I think we\\'re doing great damage to the judiciary by politicizing every judicial nomination,\" he said. \\'I expect judicial decrees to be obeyed\\' Gorsuch throughout the week sought to paint himself as a fair and independent judge, walking a delicate line of trying to answer questions without tipping his hand. If confirmed, Gorsuch will fill the seat vacated by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away a little more than a year ago. Though Gorsuch had deep admiration for Scalia, his attempts to stay independent meant keeping his distance from the former justice at times. Sen. Patrick Leahy, who said Scalia was \"intelligent\" and a friend, asked Gorsuch if he agreed with Scalia\\'s comment that the 2013 renewal of the Voting Rights Act was a \"perpetuation of racial entitlement.\" Gorsuch did not give a direct answer. \"I don\\'t speak for Justice Scalia,\" he said. \"I speak for myself.\"  The nominee also repeatedly suggested he\\'d be willing to rule against the President, if necessary. Citing the Bush administration and torture, Leahy asked Gorsuch on Wednesday if he thinks there\\'s any circumstance in which a president can ignore a law on the books. \"I can\\'t think of one, offhand,\" Gorsuch said. Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, used his answer to transition to a question about the Trump administration. Without mentioning a name, Leahy referenced a quote by Trump adviser Stephen Miller on the President\\'s executive order banning immigration from six Muslim majority countries. Miller, around the time a federal court ruled against the ban earlier this year, stated that the President\\'s powers to protect the nation \"will not be questioned.\" Reading the quote, Leahy asked Gorsuch if a president would have to comply with a court order. \"That\\'s the rule of law in this country,\" Gorsuch said. \"I\\'m a judge now, and I take that seriously,\" he added. \"And you better believe I expect judicial decrees to be obeyed.\" \\'Law of the land\\'  On the campaign trail, Trump said he would appoint a judge who would overturn the Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion, Roe v. Wade, but Gorsuch said he was never asked during the selection process to make promises on certain decisions. Pressed on what he would have done if Trump had asked him to do so, Gorsuch said he \"would have walked out the door.\" Gorsuch acknowledged that abortion came up once in a conversation with Trump, but he said it was in the context of saying many of his supporters were opposed to it. RELATED: Nuclear option saber-rattling begins over Gorsuch vote Later in the day, he appeared to give his clearest answer yet on abortion rights. Gorsuch was asked by Sen. Dick Durbin about a book he wrote on assisted suicide, which touched on the debate over when life begins. \"As the book explains, the Supreme Court of the United States has held in Roe v. Wade that a fetus is not a person for purposes of the 14th Amendment and the book explains that,\" Gorsuch said. \"Do you accept that?\" Durbin, D-Illinois, asked. \"That\\'s the law of the land, senator,\" Gorsuch said. \"Yes.\" Democrats seize on Supreme Court decision Democrats pounced on the news that the Supreme Court Wednesday reversed an interpretation of a federal anti-discrimination statute that Gorsuch played a role in crafting. Chief Justice John Roberts explained that the federal appeals court in Denver had applied too strict a standard to claims by an autistic child\\'s parent that they were entitled to reimbursement for the cost of private education under the federal Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA). The decision reversed Wednesday was by a different three-judge panel (that didn\\'t include Gorsuch) of the same court on which he sits -- but it relies largely on an earlier decision by the same court that Gorsuch wrote. Gorsuch\\'s interpretation was that if a school district satisfies federal law, it does not need to reimburse the cost of private education, so long as it provides educational benefits to disabled students that are \"more than de minimis.\" In Wednesday\\'s opinion, the Supreme Court stressed that more was required by the federal statute. Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Durbin quizzed Gorsuch on his interpretation, with Klobuchar pointing out more than once that the Supreme Court was unanimous in its decision disagreeing with him. Gorsuch noted there was a circuit split on the standard, and argued he was trying to follow precedent as best he could. \"To suggest that we were in any way out of the mainstream or that I was doing anything unusual would be mistaken, because it\\'s the standard used by many circuits up until, I guess, today,\" he said. Gorsuch said he finds it \"wonderfully reaffirming\" that there\\'s a body like the Supreme Court that resolves situations like these in which federal courts disagree. CNN\\'s Steve Vladeck, Mary Kay Mallonee, Ben Krolowitz, and David Shortell contributed to this report. ',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Republicans are considering their next step now that many Democrats are planning to filibuster the nomination of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.   The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Monday to send Gorsuch\\'s nomination to the full Senate. The vote was along party lines, 11-9. Republicans, who number 52 in the Senate, were unsuccessful in securing the eight Democrats to join them in order to end the expected filibuster, or in more technical terms, invoke cloture.  However, the majority party can still get around it by changing the rules and requiring only a simple majority, or 51 votes, to end the debate. So far, only four Democrats -- Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado -- have said they are planning to vote to advance Gorsuch\\'s nomination. Monday afternoon during the judiciary hearing, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware became the 41st senator to say he plans to filibuster, giving Democrats enough votes to sustain the debate. By Tuesday afternoon, 44 senators had said they would oppose cloture on Gorsuch\\'s nomination.   Republicans are preparing to launch the rule change, which is also known as the \"nuclear option,\" a controversial move that Democrats took more than three years ago for all judicial nominees other than Supreme Court justices.  Neil Gorsuch\\'s sales pitch: I\\'m my own judge Here\\'s what Democrats have said about Gorsuch.  Democrats who will vote for Gorsuch:  1. Sen. Joe Manchin (West Virginia) --  \"I will vote to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the ninth justice on the Supreme Court.\" -- Tweet and statement from 3/30/2017 2. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (North Dakota) -- \"After doing my due diligence by meeting with Judge Gorsuch and reviewing his record and testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I\\'ve decided to vote in favor of his confirmation.\" Statement from 3/30/2017 3. Sen. Joe Donnelly (Indiana) -- \"After meeting with Judge Gorsuch, conducting a thorough review of his record, and closely following his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well-respected among his peers.\" -- Statement from 4/2/2017 Democrats who won\\'t filibuster 4. Sen. Michael Bennet (Colorado) -- \"Using the filibuster and nuclear option at this moment takes us in the wrong direction.  I have spent the past several weeks trying to avoid this outcome.  Changing the Senate rules now will only further politicize the Supreme Court and prevent the Senate from blocking more extreme judges in the future. I will oppose efforts to filibuster the nomination, and strongly encourage my colleagues not to use the nuclear option.\" -- Statement on 4/3/2017 Democrats who plan to filibuster: 1. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (New York) -- \"My vote will be \\'no\\'. ... To my Republican friends who think that if Judge Gorsuch fails to reach 60 votes, we ought to change the rules, I say: If this nominee cannot earn 60 votes, a bar met by each of President Obama\\'s nominees, and President Bush\\'s last two nominees, the answer isn\\'t to change the rules, it\\'s to change the nominee.\" -- Statement on Senate floor on 3/23/2017 2. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vermont) -- \"After careful consideration of Judge Gorsuch\\'s record, I have concluded that I will not vote to confirm him to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court, and I will not support Republican efforts to change the rules to choke off debate and ram the nomination through the Senate.\" -- Statement on 3/23/2017 3. Sen. Bob Casey (Pennsylvania) -- \"I don\\'t believe that Judge Gorsuch, his judicial approach, would ensure fairness for workers and families in Pennsylvania and indeed across the country, and I will not support his nomination. ... If you seek to become a justice of the Supreme Court ... you ought to be able to rack up 60 votes ... I think that\\'s the standard you should be able to meet.\"  -- Press call with reporters on 3/23/2017 4. Sen. Ron Wyden (Oregon) -- \"I will vote no on his nomination and I will vote to sustain a filibuster.\" -- Statement on 3/23/2017 5. Sen. Patty Murray (Washington) -- \"After careful consideration, I will be voting against the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, and I will oppose a cloture motion ending debate.\" -- Statement 3/24/2017 6. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) -- \"I believe Judge Gorsuch\\'s nomination should be blocked.\" -- Op-ed in the Boston Globe on 3/20/2017 7. Sen. Jeff Merkley (Oregon) -- Merkley has long been supportive of the filibuster and reiterated that on Twitter on 3/29/2017. \"I will not stand idly by and allow the people\\'s government to be stolen. We must restore our #WeThePeople democracy and #StopGorsuch.\" 8. Sen. Tom Carper (Delaware) -- \"Ultimately, I believe that moving forward with Judge Gorsuch\\'s nomination will send a signal that it\\'s acceptable to put partisan politics over fidelity to our Constitution. It is not. While I do not believe that two wrongs make a right, I believe this may be our only opportunity to right a historic wrong. Therefore, I am left with no other choice but to oppose Judge Gorsuch\\'s nomination until we find agreement on moving Judge Garland\\'s nomination forward at the same time.\" -- Statement on 3/29/2017 9. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin) --  \"President Trump and his nominee need to earn 60 votes in the Senate,\" said Baldwin. \"I will not be one of them.\" -- Journal Sentinel article on 2/2/2017 10.

Cory Booker (New Jersey) -- \"This is going to be a real test. I\\'m not sure what\\'s going to happen, but I\\'m going to oppose Judge Gorsuch every step of the way. A 60-vote threshold is not something new for Supreme Court nominees to overcome. It helps ensure that presidents seek nominees whose views are in the mainstream.\" Interview with NJ.com on 2/5/2017 12. Sen. Mazie Hirono (Hawaii) -- \"I have concluded that I will not be supporting Neil Gorsuch for this opening and so I very much support a 60-vote threshold.\" -- Interview with Wolf Blitzer on 3/27/2017 13. Sen. Tom Udall (New Mexico)  -- \"Every recent Supreme Court nominee has received at least 60 votes either for cloture or confirmation. Judge Gorsuch will be subject to the same test, and therefore, I will vote no on his confirmation, including cloture.\" -- Statement on 3/24/2017 14. Sen. Jack Reed (Rhode Island) -- \"I will vote no on cloture and no on his nomination.\" -- Statement on 3/24/2017 15. Sen.

Whether we like it or not, the rules of the Senate requires 60 votes for closure and that shouldn\\'t change for Gorsuch. It\\'s been the case for every other vote that hasn\\'t been exempt for that requirement.\"  -- To reporters on 3/27/2017 16. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island) -- \"Judge Gorsuch needed to convince me he would not join the posse that has relentlessly stretched the law to benefit Republican partisans and corporations at the expense of everyone else.

Life tenure. Highest court in the land. Should have to get to 60 votes.\" -- To reporters on 3/27/2017 18. Sen. Kamala Harris (California) -- \"Exactly yes,\" Harris said when asked by David Axelrod for \"Axe Files\" whether she\\'s urging Democrats to force supporters to produce 60 votes.

Al Franken (Minnesota) -- \"Earlier today, I sat down with WCCO\\'s Esme Murphy and announced that I will be voting no on Judge Neil Gorsuch because I fear he\\'d be a part of a U.S. Supreme Court that would put the interests of large corporations before Minnesotans and all Americans.\" -- Statement on Facebook on 3/26/2017 20. Sen.

I cannot support a nominee who refuses to answer important questions. With Judge Gorsuch on the bench, I am deeply concerned that dark money will continue to drown out the voices and votes of citizens, the court will stand between women and their doctors, and the government will reach into the private lives of law-abiding Americans. These are not Montana values, which is why I cannot support this nomination.\" His office also said  Tester will be voting \"no\"  on cloture as well as on final passage. -- Statement on 4/2/2017 38.

Sen. Bob Menendez (New Jersey) -- \"The last four judges confirmed to the Supreme Court received more than 60 votes in the U.S. Senate, and there is no reason that Neil Gorsuch shouldn\\'t be held to the same standard.

Independent Sen. Angus King (Maine) -- \"Although there could be circumstances where it might be appropriate to support cloture and then vote against the nomination, the current status of this procedure does not strike me as such a case. If I am opposed to this nomination, it seems logical to oppose cloture because under the current rules, this would defeat the nomination. To support cloture in the current circumstance would make me guilty of \\'complicity\\', to borrow Judge Gorsuch\\'s memorable term.\" -- statement on 4/4/2017 This story has been and will be updated as CNN receives updated information.

       " 'Washington  (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that Neil Gorsuch  will be confirmed to the Supreme Court next Friday , confidently dismissing Democratic efforts to block the nominee knowing the GOP can use the \"nuclear option\" to get past the Democrats\\' filibuster if needed. But the exact math behind breaking a filibuster or changing the Senate rules did not yet appear to add up as of Tuesday evening.  McConnell: Full Senate vote on Gorsuch on April 7 Senior Democrats predicted their caucus will ban together to block Gorsuch on a key procedural vote expected next Thursday. And they held out hope that not all Republicans would back McConnell\\'s use of the nuclear option, a controversial rule change that would lower the threshold for overcoming a filibuster for Supreme Court nominees from 60 to 51 and allow them to confirm Gorsuch on a partly line vote.  \"I don\\'t want to change the rules of the Senate, and I hope we\\'re not confronted with that choice,\" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one of several GOP moderates Democrats think might vote against the nuclear option. In an interview with CNN, Collins stopped short of saying whether she would vote for the rule change.   But Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the GOP whip, predicted enough Republicans would vote together to approve the nuclear option. RELATED: Inscrutable Gorsuch raises Democratic ire \"I hope it doesn\\'t come to that but if the Democrats force our hand, then we\\'ll be prepared to do what we need to do to confirm the judge,\" Cornyn said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who actively whipped members of his caucus on the issue, said Gorsuch didn\\'t \"impress\" Democrats during his confirmation hearings and faces \"an uphill climb\" to get to 60 votes. Only a handful of Democrats appeared to be even contemplating advancing Gorsuch, although some Democrats thought the number might climb as the vote nears.  \"I\\'m going to base my decision on him, input from Montanans, and what his opinions are,\" said Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana, who is under immense pressure from fellow lawmakers and outside interest groups. The second-term senator is running for re-election in a state President Donald Trump easily won in November.  Tester said he hoped the Republicans would not use the nuclear option because it would make the Senate more like the House -- where majority party can rule without much input from the minority party -- but insisted that issue would not weigh into his decision. The status of the Democratic filibuster  Republicans are struggling to come up with the eight Democrats needed to join them in breaking the filibuster.   Only two Democrats -- Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota -- have signaled they would oppose the filibuster, but even those two senators have hesitated to be definitive about it.  RELATED: Here\\'s how senators plan to vote on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch The Republican National Committee targeted 12 Democrats from mostly states that Trump won, urging them through paid ad campaigns to support an up-or-down vote on Gorsuch -- code for opposing the filibuster.  However, several of those senators, like Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, have said they\\'ll join the filibuster and won\\'t support Gorsuch. Republicans are still waiting to hear from some of the targeted Democrats, like Tester, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, and Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, all of who have been mum this week on where they\\'re leaning.  Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado has also stayed silent. He introduced Gorsuch, who\\'s from his home state, at his hearing last week but said he was doing so out of tradition and wasn\\'t necessarily telegraphing his support.  Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who also hasn\\'t announced his decision, said Monday on MSNBC that he doesn\\'t think Gorsuch will get the 60 votes he needs to end the filibuster. While unlikely, Democrats are hoping their filibuster will result in Republicans deciding against using the nuclear option and instead put forth a different nominee.   RELATED: Orrin Hatch to back nuclear option if needed to confirm Gorsuch \"If the nominee cannot earn the support of 60 Senators, the answer is not to break precedent by fundamentally and permanently changing the rules and traditions of the Senate, the answer is to change the nominee,\" Schumer said Tuesday on the Senate floor.  According to CNN\\'s latest whip count, 26 Democrats are on the record planning to join the filibuster. That\\'s a little more than half of the Democratic caucus. More are expected to announce their decision in the coming days.  But the real number to focus on is eight -- the number of Democrats needed to vote against the filibuster.  And so far there are only two maybes, and its not immediately clear whom the remaining six would be.  Republicans threaten controversial nuclear option  While Republicans can win at the end of the day using the nuclear option, it\\'s not a choice they\\'re particularly thrilled to make.  It was a controversial move when Harry Reid lowered the filibuster threshold in 2013 for cabinet nominees, and it would be just as controversial for Republicans do so now.  Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said they don\\'t \"have a choice.\"    \"It\\'s very unfortunate. I think it turns our stomach,\" the first term Republican told reporters Tuesday, adding that he\\'s uneasy with the idea of setting a new precedent. \"Once it\\'s been used once, it\\'s going to be used time and time again.\" Rounds expressed concern that it could ultimately be used to impact legislation, in addition to presidential nominees, and he thinks Democrats are privately wanting the rules change so that Republicans can shoulder some of the drama that Democrats stirred up in 2013.   \"I think it hurt the Democrats when they did it, and I think they\\'d like to share that with Republicans in the future,\" he argued.  When asked whether he\\'d support the nuclear option, Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, said he hopes it doesn\\'t get to that point and questioned \"whether long term it makes any sense at all.\" \"If we keep doing that, you eventually end up being very much like the House and historically that\\'s not a good thing for the Senate according to what the Founding Fathers wanted,\" he added. Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, said he was playing it \"straight and narrow right now\" on whether he was leaning in favor of the nuclear option or against it. But he added: \"I think his confirmation is an absolutely necessity.\" What happens next The Senate Judiciary Committee will meet next Monday to vote on Gorsuch and send him to the full Senate with a final confirmation vote expected Friday evening, according to a GOP leadership aide who explained the anticipated schedule for next week. On Tuesday, McConnell would move to end floor debate on Gorsuch.  This would set up the key procedural vote Thursday morning when the chamber\\'s 52 Republicans hope to get at least eight Democrats to join them in defeating a filibuster of the judge. If the filibuster is not defeated, McConnell would then move immediately on the nuclear option, which would need a simple majority of those present and voting to succeed.  Vice President Mike Pence is expected to be in the chamber if he is needed to break a tie. If Republicans hold together and the nuclear option passes, the Senate would vote again to break the filibuster of Gorsuch, this time needing just 51 votes to do so.  After that, Senate rules allow for up to 30 hours of what\\'s called \"post-cloture\" debate time. That would set up a final confirmation vote for Gorsuch sometime Friday evening.  He would only need a simple majority on that final vote. ',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Republicans in the Senate are plotting an aggressive effort to save Andrew Puzder\\'s embattled nomination to become labor secretary, leaning on well-funded business groups, the White House and the powerful Senate majority leader to ensure his confirmation over stiff opposition from the left.  Puzder\\'s nomination has emerged of particular interest to Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who has a long-standing relationship with the nominee. In private meetings with GOP senators, McConnell has told his colleagues that he thinks Puzder is more prepared than any nominee in history to be labor secretary, several sources say. This has surprised some of McConnell\\'s colleagues because his wife, Elaine Chao, served as George W. Bush\\'s labor secretary for eight years, but it underscores the seriousness that the shrewd GOP leader is taking the nomination. While GOP leaders have expressed confidence that Puzder will be confirmed, some top Republicans privately believe that the battle over the Labor Department nominee could be the most intense of any of President Donald Trump\\'s picks so far. That\\'s partly because GOP senators have already taken a beating over confirming Betsy DeVos as education secretary, and many are wary about expending even more political capital for another nominee who is bound to prompt an emotional fight -- especially one with significant liabilities before his hearings have even begun.  The most significant: His revelation that he hired a housekeeper from Guatemala who was an undocumented immigrant, only to pay back taxes later. \"I have not reached a decision,\" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. \"I almost always wait until there is a hearing unless I know the individual well. I have had two conversations with Mr. Puzder, and I think there are questions outstanding that I\\'m sure will be ... delved into at his hearing.\" And Puzder is at serious risk of losing some swing Democratic votes, meaning Trump cannot afford to lose more than two GOP votes in the Senate to get him confirmed. \"He hasn\\'t gotten through that yet,\" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, said of Puzder\\'s hiring of an undocumented immigrant. \"He\\'s going to have to explain that. That\\'s serious.\" At a private meeting in McConnell\\'s office Wednesday night, the GOP members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee discussed Puzder\\'s problems, with several raising concerns about the undocumented immigrant, according to several sources.  But McConnell, sources said, made the case that Puzder should not lose sight of the bigger picture: That Puzder has spent many years delving deeply into labor and business issues and that combined with his record running the parent company of the Hardee\\'s and Carl\\'s Jr. restaurant chains, it makes him imminently qualified for the job. McConnell made the case that Puzder acknowledged his \"mistake.\"  Leaving the meeting, some believed the GOP leader would be heavily involved in convincing his skeptical members of to go along with the nomination. McConnell, in particular, trusts Puzder because of his extensive writings over the years about key policy issues affecting businesses, sources said. And the two have a relationship through the fundraising circuit that McConnell regularly hits. \"He was very effective,\" said one GOP Senate source who attended the meeting, talking about McConnell\\'s sales job. Still, several key Republicans on the committee are withholding their support so far, including Collins, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Lisa Murkowksi of Alaska. \"It\\'s something that\\'s got to be considered in the totality of the other issues,\" Isakson said. \"When he knew, how we knew, how he found out, what he did afterward ... I\\'m not prepared to make a definitive statement until I\\'ve seen all the facts.\" Battling back against liberal groups What makes things tougher: Puzder\\'s confirmation hearing will take place next week -- right before a week-long Senate recess. That means the confirmation vote will not take place for potentially a few weeks after the hearings, giving opponents time to mobilize against him.  And already, Democrats are ratcheting up their attacks, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warning Trump on Thursday that his party is prepared to do battle. \"This is Donald Trump believing he can get away with almost anything,\" Schumer said Thursday. \"He will not be able to.\"  To counter the battle from the left, McConnell and Sen. Lamar Alexander are hatching their plans. They plan to lean on roughly a dozen outside groups on the right -- including groups that represent home builders, retailers, small businesses and restaurant associations -- to launch a major public relations offensive in support of Puzder.  And they are getting assurances from the White House that it will be more engaged in the effort to confirm Puzder, with hopes that the President will persuade some in the labor community to sit out of the battle. The cover from the outside was lacking in the DeVos fight -- making things much harder for the GOP as it took a beating from the left. A number of Republicans privately griped about the White House\\'s lack of public push for DeVos as the GOP senators took a brunt of the blame. Alexander expressed confidence in Puzder\\'s chances. \"I think he\\'s a very talented individual,\" said Alexander, who chairs the HELP Committee. But above all else, Republicans need Puzder to have a strong performance at his hearings next week -- to win over GOP skeptics more than anything else. Beyond Puzder\\'s undocumented immigrant problems, the nominee has other personal issues as well. His messy divorce from three decades ago has entered the media spotlight, when he was accused of domestic abuse at that time, something his ex-wife discussed in disguise on the \"Oprah Winfrey Show.\" But she later dropped the charges, and has since sent a letter to the HELP Committee members vouching for his character and saying she regretted pressing charges. \"Andy is not and was not abusive or violent,\" said Lisa Fierstein in the January 18 letter to the committee. \"He is a good, loving, kind man and a deeply committed loving father.\"  Yet, Puzder risks putting off senators from the left and the right. Other ideological issues are bound to come up that could spark controversy from liberal groups and some conservatives may be put off by his more moderate immigration positions.  But the Trump administration is expressing confidence. \"The Democrats and their special interests -- and particularly the unions -- have taken their smear tactics to a new level of ugly,\" said Puzder spokesman George Thompson. \"The fact is, Mr. Puzder is exactly what America\\'s workers and businesses need -- a proven job creator.\" CNN\\'s Ted Barrett and Ashley Killough contributed to this story.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump hosted a bipartisan group of senators for lunch Thursday at the White House to discuss their potential support for Neil Gorsuch, the President\\'s Supreme Court pick. The meeting was an attempt by Trump to smooth the way for Gorsuch\\'s confirmation, but his attempt may have been colored by his continued criticism of Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. Blumenthal said Wednesday that Gorsuch told him he found Trump\\'s previous attack on a federal judge \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\" Trump responded early Thursday morning saying it was Blumenthal who was wrong about what Gorsuch said. Trump repeated that claim even as he was seated with five members of the Senate\\'s Democratic caucus.  \"His comments were misrepresented and what you should do is ask Sen. Blumenthal about his Vietnam record that didn\\'t exist,\" Trump said at the beginning of a meeting, referring to the fact that the Connecticut Democrat was forced to apologize in 2010 for saying he served in Vietnam, when he only served during the Vietnam era. Blumenthal had not been invited to the White House gathering. Four of the Democratic senators who attended the lunch -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana -- are up for re-election in 2018 in states Trump won in 2016.  Manchin and Heitkamp, addressing reporters after the meeting, tried to avoid questions about whether it bothered them that Trump questioned the service record of a Senate colleague.  But when pressed, Manchin offered a simple \"oh yeah\" when asked if it bothered him.  Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who is up for reelection in 2018, did not attend Thursday\\'s lunch with Trump, due to a previously scheduled constituent meeting. Trump and McCaskill are now working to set up a phone call instead, the senator\\'s spokeswoman said.  Sens. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, and Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, also attended the meeting. Trump also looked to shore up support for Gorsuch within his own party Thursday by inviting GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, John Cornyn of Texas, Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who all attended. Blumenthal back-and-forth Within a half-hour after Blumenthal relayed Gorsuch\\'s comments about Trump on Wednesday, a White House-tapped aide to the judge confirmed them. Several other senators, including Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, later relayed similar accounts of Gorsuch forcefully criticizing Trump\\'s public attacks on the judiciary branch. And on Thursday morning, Blumenthal said on MSNBC Gorsuch specifically told him he \"should feel free to mention what I said about these attacks being disheartening and demoralizing.\" But none of that stopped Trump from firing off a shot against Blumenthal -- and at the same time raising questions about the coherence of the White House\\'s messaging. \"Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?\" Trump tweeted Thursday morning. CNN\\'s Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told a bipartisan group of senators at the White House Thursday that he is interested in learning more about the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" immigration reform bill, multiple meeting attendees told CNN. Backing a comprehensive immigration reform bill like the one pushed by a bipartisan group of senators in 2013 would be a dramatic break from what Trump said during his 2016 campaign. The President made the comment Thursday as he urged the group to work together to figure out a solution to break gridlock on immigration. White House press secretary Sean Spicer quickly knocked down speculation that Trump was supportive of a bill like the one supported by the Gang of Eight, which would have created a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants as long as certain border security measures were undertaken at the same time. But those in the room said Trump did not dismiss the measure and encouraged bipartisan work on immigration. Senators, according to one attendee, told Trump that it was important to fix the nation\\'s immigration system and stressed that Trump was in a \"unique position to help do that.\" \"He encouraged us to review it,\" West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said referring to the 2013 bill. \"He didn\\'t boo-hoo it,\" Manchin added. \"He engaged.\" According to a source in the room, the plan to address comprehensive immigration reform was broached by Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican who backed the measure in 2013. Trump responded, the source said, by expressing an openness to reopen talks about immigration reform. \"The senator did suggest that it is important to fix our immigration system and that the President is in a unique position to help do that,\" a spokesman for Alexander said after the meeting. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said immigration was just one of several issues discussed at the meeting and was not the main focus. But he encouraged Trump not to pursue a big immigration bill, instead to move on the issue piece by piece. \"I basically said, \\'Mr. President, before these people lead you down a rabbit trail, let me tell you that what they\\'re talking about will never pass.\\' But I think there was an almost universal interest in addressing our lauded immigration system,\" Cornyn told CNN. Spicer, in response to reporting on the meeting, told reporters that Trump was not in favor of a Gang of Eight-style bill. Instead, Spicer said Trump pledged to look at whatever the senators came up with as an immigration compromise but did not express support for \"amnesty.\" \"He said, \\'If you guys want to work on something, I\\'m willing to look at it,\\'\" said Spicer, adding that Trump remains opposed to the Gang of Eight bill. In August 2015, Trump told CNN that his immigration reform plan would require people to leave the country.  \"No, there\\'s not a path to legalization unless people leave the country, if they come back in and then they have to start paying taxes,\" he told Anderson Cooper. And during the Republican primary, Trump repeatedly bashed opponents -- particularly Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida -- who backed the measure. \"Marco is a politician -- he flip-flops,\" Trump tweeted in response to a story that alleged Rubio\\'s bill would have helped cities that harbored undocumented immigrants. Rubio eventually backed away from his work on the Gang of Eight bill, even attempting to argue during his 2016 presidential campaign that the bill was never meant to become law. Eight senators -- four Democrats and four Republicans -- got together in 2013 to push the comprehensive immigration reform measure that was meant to solve the immigration problem with a mix of progressive and conservative solutions. In a 68-32 vote, the roughly 1,200-page measure was passed by the Senate in 2013. But House Republicans, whose members railed against illegal immigration and the comprehensive immigration reform measure, never took up the bill.

       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump, stung by Republicans\\' failure to pass a party line  vote on health care reform  earlier this year, said Thursday that he expects -- and will court -- Democratic support for tax reform. Trump\\'s new openness to work with Democrats signals the President\\'s eagerness to live up to his reputation as a shrewd negotiator. Trump  struck a deal on funding the government earlier this month  and appears  to have reached an agreement for a tentative framework  with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on a narrow immigration fix Wednesday night. But the work with Democrats could come at a cost: Republicans were not eager Thursday to go along with Trump\\'s planned immigration deal, and some of his more conservative followers said the President\\'s shift went against all he campaigned for. Mnuchin\\'s blunders bolstering Cohn\\'s stock as tax reform looms Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday, Trump said if Republicans are \"unable to stick together, then I am going to have to get a little help from the Democrats.\" \"I will tell you, for the tax bill, I would be very surprised if I don\\'t have at least a few Democrats,\" Trump said. \"I have states that I won by 30 points and more where they have people running and frankly, and I think, and I get the impression, that they very much like the ideas of this tax plan.\" Trump dined with three red state Democrats  -- North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and West Virginia Joe Manchin -- earlier this week to discuss tax reform. The three a viewed as \"gettable\" Democrats in the push pass tax reform, White House sources said. Details about Trump\\'s tax plan have been scant. Trump\\'s two point men on the issue -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn -- went to Capitol Hill earlier this week to brief top negotiators on Capitol Hill about their plans. Republicans hope to lower the corporate tax rate as part of their tax overhaul and Mnuchin and Cohn have both said they hope to get the bill passed by the end of the year. While some Democrats have signaled their tentative support for tax reform, many are waiting to see the details of a plan and even more have said they will not support a bill that gives the richest Americans a tax cut. During a meeting Wednesday on tax reform, Trump said \"the rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,\" adding that what \"the wealthy\" pay in taxes will either stay the same or possible go higher. Trump echoed that sentiment on Thursday while speaking with reporters. \"The wealthy Americans are not my priority. My priority are people in the middle class,\" he said. \"And that\\'s where we\\'re giving the big tax reduction to.\"',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) The Senate voted Monday to confirm former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as the next treasury secretary, the latest Cabinet member to be approved after a lengthy and at times contentious confirmation process. The vote was 53-47, mostly along party lines, with Sen. Joe Manchin the lone Democrat voting yes. The Senate then voted to confirm David Shulkin as the next secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The vote was 100-0. Democrats were unable to block Mnuchin, as they are outnumbered by a largely unified bloc of Republicans, 52-48.  Republicans lauded Mnuchin\\'s lengthy experience in the field.  \"Mr. Mnuchin has 30 years of experience working in a variety of capacities in the financial sector,\" said Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican. \"He has experience managing large and complicated private-sector enterprises and in negotiating difficult compromises and making tough decisions -- and being accountable for those decisions. Mr. Mnuchin is clearly qualified to serve as secretary of the United States Treasury.\" But Senate Democratic leaders still looked to score some points before Mnuchin\\'s vote. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, hosted a briefing on Trump\\'s \"pro-Wall Street agenda\" shortly before the Mnuchin vote. Schumer argued that Trump was breaking promises made in his populist pitch to voters by hiring Wall Street veterans, like Mnuchin, to oversee the very institutions he railed against on the trail. \"President Trump told Steve Mnuchin -- a Wall Street insider with decades of experience in that board room he described -- \\'you\\'re hired\\' as my treasury secretary no less,\" Schumer said Monday. \"That\\'s a broken promise.\" The Mnuchin fight has lacked some of the last-minute theatrics that marked confirmation battles last week -- including a string of protests against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and a surprising rebuke of Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the fight over Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Instead, all eyes are on Labor nominee Andrew Puzder, who will come up for a confirmation hearing Thursday, almost one week after revelations that he had hired an undocumented worker to do housework for him. That revelation has led Democrats to call for his removal as nominee, but top Republicans have stood firm behind Puzder. The main focus will be on rank-and-file Republicans, and whether they change their minds on him. Trump\\'s pick for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, continues his tour of Capitol Hill this week -- with stops with Republican Sens. Todd Young of Indiana, Joni Ernst of Iowa and John Kennedy of Louisiana.',\n",

       " 'The man who ran the West Virginia mine that exploded in 2010, in what was one of the worst U.S. mine disasters in decades, was indicted Thursday on federal charges. Don Blankenship, the former CEO of Massey Energy, faces four charges: conspiracy to violate mandatory federal mine safety and health standards, conspiracy to impede federal mine safety officials, making false statements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and securities fraud. The counts carry a maximum combined penalty of 31 years in prison, according to the Justice Department. \"The indictment alleges that from about January 1, 2008, through about April 9, 2010, Blankenship conspired to commit and cause routine, willful violations of mandatory federal mine safety and health standards at Massey Energy\\'s Upper Big Branch mine, located in Raleigh County, West Virginia,  the department said in a statement. Massey was the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States and the largest mine operator in Appalachia at the time of the Upper Big Branch explosion, which killed 29 workers. But it had racked up an extensive list of violations before the disaster, and a 2011 report by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration found that Massey had a history of \"systematic, intentional, and aggressive efforts\" to evade safety regulations. The company kept two sets of books to mislead miners and inspectors, tipped off crews before surprise inspections and intimidated workers to prevent them from reporting violations, the report found. Blankenship\\'s attorney, William W. Taylor, III, said Thursday that his client is innocent of the charges, and will fight them and be acquitted. \"Don Blankenship has been a tireless advocate for mine safety. His outspoken criticism of powerful bureaucrats has earned this indictment. He will not yield to their effort  to silence him. He will not be intimidated,\" the lawyer said. Massey was bought by another company, Alpha Natural Resources, after the disaster. In December 2011, it settled with the Justice Department for a record $209 million in fines, penalties and compensation for families of the men killed at Upper Big Branch.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Senate Democrats on Wednesday sought to ride the latest revelations of coordination between President Donald Trump\\'s campaign and Russian officials while Senate Republicans -- even some of the most hawkish on Russia -- sought to hold the line against new investigations.  Democrats called an \"emergency\" caucus meeting at the Capitol to discuss their options roughly 12 hours after new reports that the FBI is investigating extensive communications between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officers.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the investigation into Russia\\'s connections to the Trump campaign and other facets, including the phone calls that led to the resignation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn this week. \"We need to get all the facts, so in the days and weeks ahead, the Trump administration needs to answer some serious questions,\" the New York Democrat said Wednesday morning. \"These questions must be asked by an independent and unbiased law enforcement authority.\" As he headed to the meeting, Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said anything less than a complete investigation would amount to a \"coverup.\"  \"We\\'ve got to look at what our options are to send a message that a cover-up is not OK,\" Murphy said. \"By stopping a bipartisan, independent investigation from moving forward, we will continue to incentivize the separation of the intelligence forces from the executive. That\\'s terrible for this country.\"  But Senate Republicans, including those who have been hawkish on Russia, held their ground against Democratic calls for deeper investigations.  \"I think that first questions have to be answered and then to go from there,\" said Sen. John McCain, one of a handful of Republicans who has broken with his party in calling for a tough stand against Russia. \"We need to find out a lot of basic information, because it is just the beginning of this, before we decide to move forward.\" When asked if there should be an independent investigation of Flynn and the latest Russian revelations, Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who frequently breaks with her party, dismissed the idea.  \"There is an independent investigation, it\\'s being done by the Intelligence Committee,\" she said.  Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee who met yesterday to discuss Flynn\\'s stunning resignation, said they were still plotting the timeline of their investigation but hoped to briefed soon by intelligence officials.  Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, said he was looking forward to reading the transcripts of Flynn\\'s calls with the Russian ambassador to the US and having Flynn testify before the committee. \"Right now we\\'re going for everything we can to make sure the committee\\'s up and running and does it job,\" he said. \"Once we get into it, all the different intelligence people will come in.\"  Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican member of the intelligence panel, said he was confident in the investigation already underway.  \"That\\'s an ongoing situation and Flynn will be a part of it,\" said the Florida senator, who is scheduled to have dinner with Trump on Wednesday. \"I\\'m confident in the process we put in place. It\\'s bipartisan. There is strong support for it.\" House Democrats are also pressing for an aggressive investigation, including asking for transcripts and calling for Flynn to testify.  However, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other top Republicans insist that any probe should be part of the existing House Intelligence Committee investigation.   Chairman Devin Nunes, of California, dismissed any move last night to create any outside panel, and all top GOP leaders continue to back him up and defer any questions on next steps to him.  California Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking member of that House committee, told reporters Wednesday he\\'s meeting later with the chairman.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Don Blankenship, the former CEO of Massey Energy, was convicted Thursday of conspiracy to willfully violate mine health and safety standards, a U.S. attorney said. Blankenship was acquitted on two other felony charges,  according to CNN affiliate WCHS : securities fraud and making false statements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The former CEO ran the West Virginia mine that exploded in 2010, in what was one of the worst U.S. mine disasters in decades.  Former Massey Energy CEO indicted in wake of 2010 mine explosion Sentencing is set for March. Blankenship could face up to a year in federal prison.  \"This is a landmark day for the safety of coal miners. Really it\\'s a landmark day for all working men and women,\" Booth Goodwin, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, told reporters. \"The CEO and chairman of one of America\\'s largest coal companies now stands convicted of willful violations of the laws that are designed to keep coal miners safe.\" He said that it was his hope the verdict would make a difference throughout the country. \"To go from boardroom to the prospect of incarceration sends a powerful message to executives who would ignore the safety of their workers. It doesn\\'t matter who you are, how rich you are, how powerful you are, if you violate the laws and gamble with the lives of your workers, you will be held accountable,\" Goodwin said. Coal exec pleads guilty, points to former CEO in mine probe Blankenship\\'s attorney told reporters his team was disappointed by the jury\\'s decision, but he believes the conviction will be overturned on appeal. \"We wanted to be acquitted on all counts, but the fact the jury acquitted him on all felonies and convicted only on the misdemeanor is some consolation,\" WCHS reported attorney Bill Taylor as saying.

       " 'Washington (CNN) The Senate confirmed Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency, an agency Republicans desperately want to rein in after what they charge was eight years of dangerous activism under the Obama administration that hurt businesses, jobs and the economy.  Pruitt maybe just the person to do it. As Oklahoma attorney general he sued the agency many times in that pursuit and has vowed to curb the EPA\\'s regulatory reach once in office.  The largely party line vote was 52-46.  Democratic senators Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who both represent energy producing states, voted for Pruitt. Moderate Republican Susan Collins of Maine voted against him. \"He\\'s exceptionally qualified,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"He\\'s dedicated to environmental protection. And, as someone with state government experience, he understands the real-world consequences of EPA actions and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are sustainable over the long-term.\"  The vote came a day after a federal judge ruled the Oklahoma attorney general\\'s office must turn over thousands of emails related to Pruitt\\'s communications with fossil fuel companies, which have a large presence in his state.   Environmental activists and many Democrats pushed to delay the confirmation vote until those emails are released -- probably sometime next week -- but Republicans had no interest in a delay, especially after Democrats deliberately slow-walked the confirmation process for many of President Donald Trump\\'s Cabinet. In a last fit of protest, Democrats kept the Senate in session overnight so they could make speeches about their concerns with Pruitt and his close ties to the oil and gas industry. \"Mr. Pruitt has extreme environmental policy views. And he has zero experience running an environmental protection agency. In fact, he does not believe in the fundamental mission of EPA,\" said Sen. Tom Udall, D-New Mexico. \"Attorney General Pruitt made his name opposing EPA rules that protect human health and the environment, fighting against clean air and clean water, disregarding the science behind the EPA\\'s protections for human health and the environment, on behalf of for-profit special interests, not the public interest.\" At a press conference Friday, Merkley said the first batch of emails will be released on Tuesday, with a second batch released on February 26. They scanned documents will be transferred to the Center for Media and Democracy, then the Senate will get copies. So Democrats originally requesting the vote be postponed until March 3, but that request was denied.  Democrats also lost a motion to extend debate until February 27, in a mostly party-line vote. McConnell argued that Democrats were simply using stalling tactics. \"The goal here is to feed the base, to give people a chance to get organized and complain and they want to have Pruitt out there over the recess so all of their supporters can come express themselves,\" McConnell told reporters Friday. In an extraordinary lobbying blitz against Pruitt, the labor union that represents EPA employees urged their members to call senators and urge them to vote against Pruitt.  The Senate is scheduled to begin a week long recess after votes Friday and will return to confirm more Cabinet nominees when they return.  Next up will be Commerce nominee Wilbur Ross, Interior nominee Ryan ZInke, Housing and Urban Development nominee Dr. Ben Carson, and Energy nominee Rick Perry.

       " 'Washington (CNN) Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said Wednesday she will vote against President Donald Trump\\'s pick for Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt. Collins -- who voted against the confirmation of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and,  according to sources , indicated she was likely to vote against Andrew Puzder for labor secretary before he withdrew Wednesday -- is the first Republican to break ranks over Pruitt. \"The fact is, Mr. Pruitt and I have fundamentally different views of the role and mission of the EPA,\" Collins said in a  statement .  Collins did say, however, she would vote to invoke cloture on Pruitt\\'s nomination, which would help clear him from the threat of a filibuster.  Republicans currently hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate, with Vice President Mike Pence holding a tie-breaking vote. A source told CNN that West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin will likely support Pruitt. Pruitt is currently the Oklahoma attorney general, and in that office, he has led lawsuits against the agency he stands to lead. Despite overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change, Pruitt  has said  human impact on the climate needs more debate. Environmentalists have staunchly opposed his nomination, while many Republicans have praised him for combating what they view as regulatory overreach. A vote to break the filibuster is scheduled for Thursday, and a final confirmation vote is expected Friday afternoon, assuming Democrats do not yield back time. They have not signaled their intention to do so and worked to delay recent confirmation votes. CNN\\'s Manu Raju and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said on Thursday that she may face a primary before the 2018 mid-term elections, comparing calls for ideological purity from the Democratic base to the conservative Tea Party movement of the Obama era.  \"I am for sure gonna run,\" McCaskill said on  \"The Mark Reardon Show\"  on KMOX Newsradio 1120. \"And I may have a primary because there is, in our party now, some of the same kind of enthusiasm at the base that the Republican party had with the Tea Party. We are seeing that same--and many of those people are very impatient with me because they don\\'t think I\\'m pure. For example, they think I should be voting against all of Trump\\'s nominees and of course I\\'m judging each nominee on its own merit.\" McCaskill is among a group of red state Democrats up for reelection in 2018 that also includes Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, and North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.  In Thursday\\'s interview, she told the St. Louis radio station it was \"too early\" to know how she\\'d vote on Neil Gorsuch, Trump\\'s pick to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court. She added that while she was making decisions about Trump\\'s nominees based on individual merits, that wasn\\'t \"good enough\" for some members of her party. \"As of today it\\'s about half and half of the ones I\\'ve voted no on and the ones I\\'ve voted yes on and I\\'m making an individual decision based on merit on each one,\" McCaskill said. \"That\\'s not good enough for some of these folks who want me to be just against Trump everywhere. On the other hand, you know, I do think that I was humbled and I realized that there\\'s a whole lot of people in Missouri that fundamentally think Washington, DC, is not paying any attention to their needs. My party\\'s not talking to them about what they\\'re worried about. I hear that loud and clear and I\\'m gonna work as hard as I can to show respect for those folks and to listen and to try to do better and correct mistakes that I may have made in terms of serving them as well as I possibly can.\" She continued, \"So, I\\'m gonna remain one of the Senators who works in a bipartisan way more often than most of my colleagues and I\\'m gonna continue to try to find compromise where I can and I\\'m gonna continue to call out the president when I think he needs to be called out which, so far, has been fairly frequently but who knows how that will evolve over time.\"',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Democratic incumbents, challengers and open-seat contenders outraised Republicans across the Senate map in 2017, a new round of campaign finance reports show.  The fundraising gap is yet another sign that the GOP is struggling to take advantage of a map ripe with Democratic incumbents in red states.  The good news for Republicans: Their tax bill is more popular than it was weeks ago, polls show. And Vice President Mike Pence showed some teeth on a trip to West Virginia , previewing a more aggressive line of attack  from President Donald Trump\\'s administration against Democratic incumbents.  In this year\\'s midterm elections, Democrats -- or independents who caucus with them -- are defending 26 seats, while Republicans are defending just eight. The GOP has a 51-49 advantage in the Senate at the moment.  Here are 10 Senate seats most likely to switch party hands in this year\\'s midterms, as of February 2018: 1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller Heller raised just $820,000 in 2017\\'s fourth quarter. That\\'s bad -- particularly for an incumbent.  The Democratic candidate, Rep. Jacky Rosen, hauled in more than $1.5 million, helping her close Heller\\'s $4.2 million to $1.8 million cash on hand advantage. And Heller still has to contend with Republican primary challenger Danny Tarkanian.  RELATED: Trump tells RNC members he\\'ll campaign for Dean Heller in Nevada, will visit other states This is the only state on this list that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. It\\'s diverse, Democrats there are organized and  Heller\\'s gymnastics on health care  are sure to provide fodder for attack ads targeting him. 2. Arizona Open seat (Republican Sen. Jeff Flake is retiring) GOP Rep. Martha McSally is in a tough spot when it comes to Trump.  She  told the Los Angeles Times it\\'s \"not your business\"  whether she voted for him in 2016, and she  recently attended a fundraiser  hosted by Randy Kendrick, who funded a \"Never Trump\" super PAC. But she\\'s also backing a hard-line GOP approach to immigration.   McSally is trying to navigate through a primary against state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio while preserving some room to pivot for the general election.  The biggest problem for Republicans here is that the primary is August 28 -- which means the winner won\\'t have much time to turn to Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (who now has $5.1 million in the bank) before November.  3. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill Is Josh Hawley ready for prime time? The GOP\\'s prized recruit of the 2018 cycle raised just shy of $1 million in 2017\\'s fourth quarter and has $1.2 million on hand -- far short of McCaskill\\'s $2.9 million quarter and $9 million war chest.  The 38-year-old Missouri attorney general was also taped  blaming the cultural revolution of the 1960s for sex trafficking  -- an odd linkage that\\'s shaken up the race in recent days.  It led Democrats to chirp that Hawley demonstrated why he\\'s a less frequent presence on the campaign trail than McCaskill, who held 51 town hall events last year.  Still, Trump won Missouri by 19 percentage points. That\\'s a big hole for McCaskill to climb out of. 4. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Republicans are split over whether they really want to brand Donnelly as \"Mexico Joe.\"   The national GOP loves blasting Donnelly over reports that a family business outsourced jobs to Mexico so much that the National Republican Senatorial Committee sent a mariachi band to troll him at a campaign stop in August. But Gov. Eric Holcomb and the Indiana Republican Party saw the stunt as offensive and aren\\'t taking part in the line of attack.  Republicans face a bitter, competitive primary between Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and former state Rep. Mike Braun that won\\'t be settled until May.  In the meantime, it\\'s worth paying close attention to whether poll numbers for the GOP\\'s tax bill continue to rise. At the Republican National Committee\\'s winter meeting in Washington, one Hoosier said Donnelly could have iced this race by voting for the tax bill, and speculated that he\\'ll ultimately regret his vote against it.   5. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Manchin might have come out on top of his recent rumble with Vice President Mike Pence when he labeled Pence\\'s attacks on his vote against the tax bill \"why Washington Sucks.\" (Yes, he capitalized the S.)  But Pence sent an important signal by hitting Manchin hard in his home state: The Trump administration is ready and willing to burn its bridges with even the friendliest Democratic senators in order to take their seats this fall.  Manchin, after all, stood and applauded during Trump\\'s State of the Union when other Democratic senators sat on their hands.  This is another race where a crowded, nasty, personal GOP primary will sort itself out in May. Rep. Evan Jenkins, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and former coal baron Don Blankenship -- who was in prison just last year for conspiracy to commit mine safety violations -- are all running.  6. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp The fourth in our run of five consecutive Democratic-held seat where Trump won by double digits in 2016, this race just got a little more crowded with former state GOP chair Gary Emineth entering the race. He joins state Sen. Tom Campbell in a Republican contest that the national GOP is disappointed Rep. Kevin Cramer decided not to enter.  Remember Trump calling Heitkamp a \"good woman\" last year, on stage with the television cameras rolling? It\\'s another reason why it was so important for Pence to show he\\'s willing to give Republicans much tougher tape to use against Democratic incumbents.  7. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Tester was the only one of the five Democratic incumbents in states Trump won by double digits to vote against the continuing resolution that ended the government shutdown.  It was a risky vote, sure -- but also a reflection of the confidence Democrats have that he can hold this seat against the likes of state auditor Matt Rosendale or businessman Troy Downing.  8. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Baldwin is a top target of the Koch brothers, who plan to spend $400 million in this year\\'s midterms. They\\'ll try to use her vote against the tax bill to portray Baldwin as too liberal. And with Gov. Scott Walker up for re-election, his effective state party machinery will be running at full steam, benefiting Republicans up and down the ballot.  State Sen. Leah Vukmir and businessman Kevin Nicholson are in a competitive (and likely expensive) GOP primary. 9. Florida Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson Wake us up when Rick Scott makes up his mind.  The term-limited governor currently in his last year could announce whether he\\'ll run for the Senate in March, after Florida\\'s state legislative session wraps up and just before the filing deadline.  If he\\'s in, this is a marquee race and Democrats might have to spend heavily to defend the seat. If he\\'s out, that money could be scattered to the states that are higher on the list -- where the media markets are smaller and the advertising dollar goes much farther.  10. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown State treasurer Josh Mandel\\'s surprise withdrawal left Republicans with Rep. Jim Renacci and investment banker and major donor Mike Gibbons to take on the populist progressive Brown, who has $10 million in the bank and a little 2020 presidential buzz following him.  This is a state Trump won by 9 percentage points in 2016 -- so a rise in Trump\\'s approval rating would make Brown uncomfortable.  Just missed  Increasingly, it looks like Texas -- not Tennessee -- represents Democrats\\' best chance at putting a third GOP-held seat in play.  Democratic Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke actually outraised Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2017\\'s fourth quarter, hauling in $2.4 million to Cruz\\'s $1.9 million. That means Cruz\\'s cash on hand advantage is down to $7.3 million to O\\'Rourke\\'s $4.6 million -- nowhere near the insurmountable gap many expected.  Hotline\\'s Josh Kraushaar  convincingly made the case  for a close Texas race in part by pointing to three competitive House contests that will engage voters in the Dallas, Houston and San Antonio media markets.  Yes, there\\'s a Lucy-with-the-football element at play for Democrats in Texas. For years, they\\'ve thought they could win there -- and for years, their best candidates ultimately haven\\'t even been able to make Republicans sweat. But elections in recent months have shown that diverse states with expansive suburbs are rapidly moving leftward. It makes Texas one to watch closely.    In Tennessee, we\\'re still waiting to see whether former Gov. Phil Bredesen has shaken off the dust and is headed into an open-seat contest where he\\'ll likely face Rep. Marsha Blackburn.  In Pennsylvania, Republicans are concerned about the campaign of Rep. Lou Barletta -- a Trump ally in a year when that\\'s a politically problematic label. And in Minnesota, newly appointed Sen. Tina Smith has not yet drawn a high-profile Republican opponent. State Sen. Karin Housley looks like the leading GOP contender.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) The pain and anger of people who lost loved ones in the Upper Big Branch mine explosion could not be contained in court. Family members shouted as former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship walked to a waiting car Wednesday, shortly after being sentenced to a year in federal prison for conspiracy to willfully violate mine health and safety standards.  \"That man has no remorse,\" said Tommy Davis, who lost his son, nephew and brother in the explosion,  CNN affiliate WSAZ reported. \"He\\'s standing up there, and he\\'s hugging them people. I don\\'t hug nothing but a damn tombstone. I hold a picture. I don\\'t get to hold no grandchildren.\" Twenty-nine people died at Upper Big Branch. Blankenship was found guilty of conspiracy in December  and sentenced six years after the 2010 disaster. Massey was the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States and the largest mine operator in Appalachia at the time of the explosion, which was one of the worst U.S. mine disasters in decades. It had racked up an extensive list of violations before the explosion, and a 2011 report by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration found that Massey had a history of \"systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts\" to evade safety regulations. The company kept two sets of books to mislead miners and inspectors, tipped off crews before surprise inspections and intimidated workers to prevent them from reporting violations, the report found. Blankenship spoke to reporters briefly outside the Charleston, West Virginia, court. \"I feel badly for them,\" WSAZ reported he said. \"A lot of emotion; it\\'s understandable.\" Acting U.S. Attorney Carol Casto described Wednesday\\'s sentence as a victory for workers and workplace safety. In addition to time behind bars, Blankenship was ordered to pay a $250,000 fine. Massey was bought by another company, Alpha Natural Resources, after the disaster. In December 2011, it settled with the Justice Department for a record $209 million in fines, penalties and compensation for families of the men killed at Upper Big Branch. \"It lets companies and their executives know that you can\\'t take chances with the lives of coal miners and get away with it. Putting the former chief executive officer of a major corporation in prison sends a message that violating mine safety laws is a serious crime and those who break those laws will be held accountable,\" Casto said. But Davis feels the punishment doesn\\'t go far enough.  \"I miss my family. He hugged his, and all he gets is a year,\" WSAZ reported Davis as saying. \"They need to be stricter, more harsh penalties for people like that who puts greed -- money -- over human life.\"',\n",
       " 'Now you can get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily.  Sign up here .  (CNN) Trading punches. Watching ripples. Remembering a legend. It\\'s Thursday, and here are the 5 things you need to know to   Get Up to Speed and Out the Door . 1. Campaign 2016 The gloves are officially off, at least on the Democratic side of this wacky nomination race. Yesterday Team Sanders and Team Clinton  traded body blows , with Sanders saying Clinton wasn\\'t \"qualified\" to be president, you know with her accepting that Wall Street money and all. Earlier in the day Clinton wondered out loud if Sanders  was even a Democrat , much less \"ready to be president,\" since he kind of bombed in an interview with a media outlet last weekend. And to think we always considered this match-up the more civil of the two. 2. Panama Papers Ripples from the disclosures found within the Panama Papers continue to spread out: Iceland will swear in a new Prime Minister today, after Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson stepped down because the leaked documents revealed his links to an offshore company, triggering mass protests.  FIFA boss Gianni Infantino  is entangled in the mess as well. A controversial TV rights contract between UEFA -- European football\\'s governing body -- and a South American network has emerged from the leak. Infantino, who\\'s denied any wrongdoing, used to be UEFA\\'s general secretary -- and the contract reportedly has his signature on it. Yesterday Swiss police raided UEFA\\'s headquarters. 3. Mine explosion disaster He\\'s going to prison and has to pay a huge fine, but the punishment a former mining executive got yesterday will never be enough for some folks. Ex-Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship got  a year in federal prison  and a $250,000 fine for his part in the Upper Big Branch mine explosion that killed 29 people in West Virginia in 2010. Blankenship\\'s company deliberately evaded safety regulations for years and even had two sets of books to mislead miners and inspectors. As he walked to a car after the sentencing, victims\\' family members shouted at him. 4. Impeachment Spring is in the air, and lawmakers\\' thoughts are turning toward kicking folks out of office. In Brazil, President Dilma Rousseff is  one step closer to getting the boot  after a committee voted yesterday to continue the impeachment process against her. Closer to home, Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley\\'s scandal overshadows everything there, but don\\'t mention the \"I\"-word to Bentley, who made clear  in a news conference  yesterday that he\\'s concentrating on the \"real problems\" the state faces and not the possibility that articles of impeachment may soon be introduced against him. 5. Death penalty Executions are up sharply around the world. Amnesty International notes in its  report on the death penalty  that at least 1,634 people were executed last year, an increase of more than 50% over 2014. But most of that number comes from three countries: Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Together they accounted for almost 90% of all executions in 2015. The United States only had 28 executions last year, the lowest number in more than two decades.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who\\'s facing a tough re-election bid in West Virginia, urged his colleagues on Tuesday to pledge not to campaign against other sitting senators. \"I don\\'t see anybody in public service that\\'s willing to put their name on the ballot as my enemy. If you\\'re willing to serve, then I\\'m your comrade. I\\'m willing to work with you,\" Manchin said on the floor just before he signed a large, chart-sized pledge. The practice has created a \"hostile environment,\" Manchin told CNN before his speech, because senators remember which of their colleagues tried to defeat them. \"It could be from five or 10 years ago. But they haven\\'t forgotten.\" The practice has created a \"hostile environment,\" Manchin said before his speech in an interview with CNN, because senators remember which of their colleagues tried to defeat them. \"It could be from five or 10 years ago,\" he continued. \"But they haven\\'t forgotten.\"  It\\'s unclear how senators will respond to the pledge, though Manchin acknowledges it\\'s unlikely he\\'ll get droves of support in what he called the current \"toxic environment.\"  \"If I get one other person, that\\'d be a big win,\" he said. Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, mentioned Manchin\\'s pledge on  Twitter  and appeared to ask the No. 1 Democrat in the Senate, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, for his thoughts. \"Sen Schumer?\" his Twitter said. The non-binding pledge addresses five actions, according to a copy of the document provided to CNN. Anyone who signs it would be promising (1) not to campaign against sitting colleagues; (2) not to directly fundraise against them; (3) not to distribute any direct mail against them; (4) not to appear in or endorse any ads directed at them and (5) not to use or endorse social media campaigns that attack them.  The fundraising aspect, Manchin said, also applies to raising money for Senate campaign groups, like the National Republican Senate Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which work to defend and pick up seats for their respective parties, even if that means ousting incumbents.   Manchin stressed the pledge would only cover races with a sitting senator, not open Senate races. So, for example, if Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont signed the pledge, he could still campaign for the Democratic candidate in the Senate race in Arizona -- where Republican Sen. Jeff Flake isn\\'t running for re-election -- but Leahy couldn\\'t campaign for the Democratic candidate in Nevada, where Republican Sen. Dean Heller is seeking to keep his seat.  A filing with the Federal Election Commission, however, shows that Manchin\\'s political action committee, Country Roads, donated $1,000 to Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, who challenged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky in 2014.  Asked to explain, Manchin\\'s\\' spokesman Jonathan Kott said Manchin at the time would \"only donate against the two senators who are most responsible for the dysfunction in Washington -- Senator McConnell and Senator Reid\" (Reid, a Democrat, was the Senate majority leader at the time. FEC records do not show any contributions from Manchin\\'s PAC for or against Reid). Moving forward, Kott said, Manchin would not donate against the two current Senate leaders, McConnell and Schumer. The pledge is part of a larger effort Manchin is expected to push in the coming weeks and months as he seeks to sharpen a brand of bipartisanship and civility ahead of the midterm elections. While Manchin was elected in 2012 with 61% of the vote, Republicans view West Virginia as a potential pickup seat to help widen their slim 51-49 majority in the Senate. President Donald Trump won the state with 68% of the vote in 2016, and the state\\'s newly elected governor left the Democratic Party in August to become a Republican. Manchin is widely considered the most conservative Democrat and sided with Republicans on key votes last year, such as  confirming Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch  and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But he has faced heavy criticism from Trump for voting against the Republican-backed tax reform plan in December and not supporting efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.  \"I like Joe,\" Trump said in a  New York Times interview . \"You know, it\\'s like he\\'s the great centrist. But he\\'s really not a centrist. And I think the people of West Virginia will see that. He not a centrist.\" Attempting to navigate the political battle ahead in November, Manchin has taken on a new message of late that Washington \"sucks\" -- including in his response to Pence last week -- but he\\'s still determined to run for re-election.  Campaigning for the defeat of colleagues was largely unheard of until the past two decades and has even been practiced among the highest ranks of the Senate. In 2004, then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tennessee, traveled to South Dakota to campaign for the opponent of the then-Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. It was an unprecedented move for a Senate majority leader but it demonstrated the competitive, cutthroat political climate.  Others have made it a personal commitment to not do so, like Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats. \"I don\\'t know how you\\'re expected to work together with somebody you know that tried like hell to kick you out six months before,\" King said in a podcast he did with Manchin last month.   When Sen. Susan Collins was new to the Senate in 1997, the late Republican Sen. John Chafee advised her to never \"campaign against those with whom (she) served,\" a principle that was known as the \"Chafee rule,\"  she wrote in a 2011 op-ed.  \"The Senate is too small a place for that, he counseled. Campaign for your fellow Republicans and go to states with open seats, but do not campaign against your Democratic colleagues. It will poison your relationship with them,\" she wrote, recalling Chafee\\'s advice.  Ultimately, Manchin said he\\'d like to see the Senate make it an ethics violation to campaign or raise money for the ousting of incumbents. Asked if he had concerns that such a penalty could violate free speech rights, Manchin said, \"We work under our own rules and regulations here in the Senate.\"  \"It\\'s not violating the Constitution,\" he added. \"If you\\'re going to be a senator, that would be the ethics you agree to.\" This story has been updated to include information about contributions from Manchin\\'s political action committee in previous elections and developments through the day Tuesday. CNN\\'s Ted Barrett contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) The national debate over gun control has thrown a new dynamic into this year\\'s top Senate races. For the five Democrats defending seats in states President Donald Trump won in 2016 by double-digits, the issue is complicated: Their national party and donors want gun restrictions, but the right-of-center, exurban and rural voters they\\'ll need to win have historically opposed tighter gun laws. They\\'ll have to decide how far they can go, and how they can sell it.  For some Republicans, particularly Florida Gov. Rick Scott, it\\'s a different problem: They\\'ll be accused of ignoring opportunities to act on gun violence before the shooting in Parkland, Florida.  As we wait to see how the gun debate evolves in statehouses and on Capitol Hill, here\\'s our March edition of the 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties in November.   Remember: The current balance of power in the Senate is 51 Republicans, 49 Democrats (and independents who caucus with them). That means Democrats need a net gain of two seats to take control of the chamber. That\\'s a tough task on a map where Democrats are defending 26 seats and Republicans just have to hold eight. 1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller Primary date: June 12 Heller tops this list for two reasons: He\\'s the only Republican up for re-election in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and unlike the split fields we see in other states, he has dangerous one-on-one matchups in both the primary (against Danny Tarkanian) and the general election (against Rep. Jacky Rosen).  The good news for Heller: President Donald Trump wants to help him. Trump  told Republican National Committee members  he\\'ll go to Nevada to campaign for Heller ahead of the primary. (And if Trump forgets that promise, the fact that  Tarkanian used Ivanka Trump against Heller  will probably serve as a strong reminder.)  The bad news: Cozying up to Trump is a problem in a general election.  2. Arizona Incumbent: Open seat (Republican Sen. Jeff Flake is retiring) Primary date: August 28 In a year of Republican primaries all over the map, this one has the makings to be the nation\\'s most chaotic.  Rep. Martha McSally spent much of the last month backing away from her 2016 criticism of Trump. Former state Sen. Kelli Ward  was in Washington for CPAC  courting major donors and organizations for a well-financed brawl. And former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio is a wild card who could spoil the entire race for Republicans if he wins the primary.   With the primary still months away, Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is watching and waiting.  Flake, meanwhile, is off to New Hampshire for an event later this month, kicking up 2020 presidential speculation.  3. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill Primary date: August 7 Republican attorney general Josh Hawley has played the scandal surrounding  indicted  Gov. Eric Greitens carefully, breaking with the Missouri GOP in calling for an investigation and tweeting that there is \"no place for party or partisanship.\"  Still, Greitens\\' seemingly inevitable downfall is bad for the party\\'s brand. Navigating those choppy waters -- ideally as quickly as possible -- is important for Hawley\\'s Senate prospects in a state Trump won by 19 points in 2016.  4. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Primary date: May 8 In the three-way Republican primary between Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and former state Rep. Mike Braun, it\\'s Rokita who wields the sharpest knife.  His opening line in their first debate got at both Braun\\'s past participation in Democratic primaries and questions surrounding Messer\\'s residency. \"Mike, welcome to the Republican Party,\" Rokita said. \"Luke, welcome back to Indiana.\" Rokita\\'s all-base, all-the-time strategy was on vivid display in his first TV ad: 5. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Primary date: May 8 Manchin tried an odd idea last month: He  urged other senators to sign a pledge  not to campaign against each other.  It seemed like a self-serving proposal by a former governor who, while in that job, was chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, an organization with the sole job of defeating Republican governors.  Even if senators stay out of it, others are willing to wade in. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker endorsed attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who along with Rep. Evan Jenkins and coal CEO Don Blankenship are running to oppose Manchin. 6. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Primary date: June 12 Republicans got good news when Rep. Kevin Cramer changed his mind and decided he\\'d run against Heitkamp after all.  The cherry on top: There won\\'t be a GOP primary. State Sen. Tom Campbell, who was also in the race, is instead running for Cramer\\'s House seat.  Heitkamp will benefit from footage of Trump extending a handshake and calling her a \"good woman\" on stage at a September event. But there are good reasons Republicans consider this a top target: Trump won the state by 36 points in 2016. And Heitkamp won her seat by less than a point in 2012. Heitkamp is still well-funded and hasn\\'t had to cast many tough votes (with tax reform being a possible exception), and there remain questions about Cramer\\'s strength as a candidate. But this race looks better for Republicans now than it did a month ago.   7. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Primary date: June 5 Last in a string of five straight Democratic-held seats in states Trump won by double digits, Tester is watching and waiting to see how the GOP primary develops.  State auditor Matt Rosendale, the other Senate candidate with a flat-top, appears to be the Republican front-runner, with businessman Troy Downing, former judge Russell Fagg and state Sen. Al Olszewski are also in the race.  8. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Primary date: August 14 Many families dislike the political life. But rarely do you see the parents of a candidate -- Republican businessman Kevin Nicholson --  give the maximum possible donations to his Democratic opponent , Baldwin.  Nicholson has challenged state Sen. Leah Vukmir to six debates in a primary that is still developing. Businessman Eric Hovde is also exploring a run.  The first debate is set for March 28 hosted by WTMJ-AM and being broadcast on the radio.  9. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown Primary date: May 8 Here\\'s the counterintuitive case for Republicans having a shot here:  When state treasurer Josh Mandel dropped out, the assumption was that Brown probably had this race in the bag. But the truth about Mandel was that Republicans never believed he\\'d win. They\\'d already seen Brown beat him once, in their 2012 head-to-head.  At least Rep. Jim Renacci, the front-runner for the nomination, gives the GOP a bit of a clean slate. He\\'s capable of self-funding at least partially in an expensive state, too.  As Ohio drifts rightward, it\\'s possible this one will be harder for Democrats to put away than they\\'d like.  10. Florida Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson Primary date: August 28 In the wake of the Parkland shooting, Nelson is showing that he\\'s ready for a fight against Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican who is widely expected to announce a Senate run in the near future.  In a CNN town hall on guns,  Nelson linked Scott\\'s inaction  in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando to the Parkland shooting.  \"Two years ago, when 49 lives were taken in the Pulse nightclub, and nothing was done -- not in Washington, not in Tallahassee, not one thing offered by the administration in Tallahassee,\" he said. \"And here we are, going through this again. And it\\'s going to unfortunately very possibly continue unless we get some common-sense laws on the books.\" ',\n",
       " ' (CNN) White House aides and a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill are cheering $6 billion in new funding to fight the opioid crisis in the recently approved budget deal, but treatment advocates and drug policy experts are concerned the uptick in funding won\\'t be spent wisely and isn\\'t nearly enough. Those concerns stem from the tough-on-crime rhetoric that the Trump administration has employed in recent months, leading treatment advocates in states to worry that opioid addiction -- something President Donald Trump seized on during the 2016 campaign -- will be treated as a law enforcement, not a health, issue. If money is diverted from treatment to tackle crime, advocates said, the already small amount of money going towards the problem will do even less. Trump fed these concerns on Monday during a speech in Cincinnati when he disparaged \"blue ribbon committees\" and said he had a \"different take\" on combating opioid abuse. \"My take is you have to get really, really tough, really mean with the drug pushers and the drug dealers,\" he said. A White House official told CNN on Thursday that the Trump administration has told appropriators in Congress, who are now tasked with spending the $6 billion, that they would like to see the influx of cash spent on both treatment and law enforcement priorities. \"It is a law enforcement issue,\" the official said. \"We have a supply problem and a demand problem. ... It is all of the above.\" That worries Grant Smith, deputy director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance. \"President Trump and his administration, in many ways, are pushing a more punitive approach. And there has been a lot of rhetoric about making this a law enforcement issue,\" Smith said. \"Favoring enforcement over treatment would be a major misstep, a huge missed opportunity.\" He added: \"For decades, this country has poured billions into enforcement and billions into the war on drugs at the expense of our treatment infrastructure.\" The official dismissed concerns that the Trump administration will prioritize law enforcement over treatment, arguing that 80% of of the money the administration has spent on the crisis since Trump took office has focused on treatment. But the public rhetoric coming out of the Trump administration has recently been less caring than advocates would like, including a speech on Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggested people addicted to opioids needs to get tougher. \"I mean, people need to take some aspirin sometimes,\" Sessions said of the over-prescription of opioids. \"Tough it out.\" Since 1999, the number of American overdose deaths involving opioids has quadrupled. More than 63,600 lives were lost to drug overdose in 2016, the most lethal year yet of the drug overdose epidemic,  according to a new report  from the National Center for Health Statistics. The issue became central in the 2016 presidential election, with both Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton promising communities affected by overdose deaths to focus the federal government on the issue. Trump\\'s efforts as President, though, have left some advocates concerned, including those who felt Trump could stem the tide of opioid abuse in the United States. The Office of National Drug Control Policy, those advocates say, has seen its role diminished under Trump, and even though the President declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in 2017, he didn\\'t back up the declaration with any increase in direct funding. An official for the drug office declined to comment on the funding boost. Melania Trump has made opioid treatment a focus of her platform as first lady. She traveled to a West Virginia opioid treatment center in October 2017, her first visit to a drug treatment center to visit families since her husband took office. Concerns over funding The White House official said the money in this bipartisan agreement should be considered funding for the public health emergency, calling the agreement a \"huge and important victory.\" Some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, particularly those in states deeply affected by the opioid crisis, agree, but are now eager to ensure the money flows to their states. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, responded to the deal by saying he had been \"relentlessly pressuring congressional leadership to make sure that West Virginia gets the funding it needs to end the opioid epidemic.\" But a spokesman for the senator said Manchin is concerned about making sure states like West Virginia -- a place dramatically affected by the opioid crisis -- gets much of the funding recently approved. \"He believes we need more treatment families, and he wants a fair allocation of the money so that West Virginia, a state thetas ground zero for this, is receiving a majority of the funds,\" the spokesman said. \"He has made clear that he wants that.\" The White House official said the Trump administration understands those concerns, adding that Trump \"is committed to actual hard targets and because of that, we are going to have to go where the targets are.\" \"We are not ruling in or out any place or any approach, except for the approach that brings down the numbers,\" the official said. The other concern treatment advocates have with the new agreement is that $6 billion -- while welcome -- is not nearly enough to tackle the issue. \"It\\'s a good start,\" said Tym Rourke, the former chairman of the New Hampshire governor\\'s commission on alcohol and drug abuse prevention. \"The question of what is enough is always a big one. Is it enough? Probably not.\" In 2017, when $45 billion over 10 years was proposed in a Senate budget for states to spend on opioid addition treatment, many senators said the money wasn\\'t nearly enough. Sen. Maggie Hassan, a New Hampshire Democrat, said the money was \"a drop in the bucket that would not come close to making up for the damage\" done by the Republican healthcare bill. Hassan and her counterpart, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, cheered the passage of the budget on Friday, but both noted that far more funding was needed. \"Much more needs to be done to provide substance use disorder treatment to those who desperately need it,\" Shaheen said. \"We still need a federal response to this epidemic that matches the national public health emergency we are facing.\" Hassan agreed in a statement on Friday: \"We also know that we will ultimately need far more funding beyond this measure over the years to come to truly address this crisis.\" The White House official didn\\'t disagree that more could be done, but said the $6 billion in funding \"is the right number that can be spent well (now) and can bring the numbers down of people who are dying.\"',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Joe Manchin seems like a very nice guy. And he\\'s clearly a talented politician -- having been elected as governor and senator as a Democrat in the increasingly Republican state of West Virginia. But  his new proposal -- unveiled on Tuesday -- designed to bring comity and bipartisanship back to the Senate  makes no sense. And wouldn\\'t work. There are five basic tenets of Manchin\\'s proposal -- as outlined by CNN\\'s  Ashley Killough: 1. Don\\'t campaign against other senators.  2. Don\\'t raise money in support of challengers to sitting incumbents -- nor to the party committees tasked with electing and reelecting those incumbents. 3. Don\\'t be part of any direct mail efforts against colleagues. 4. Don\\'t be in any radio or TV ads against a fellow incumbent. 5. Don\\'t take part in any social media efforts against another senator. \"I don\\'t see anybody in public service that\\'s willing to put their name on the ballot as my enemy,\" Manchin told Killough. \"If you\\'re willing to serve, then I\\'m your comrade. I\\'m willing to work with you.\" Which sounds great! People are frustrated that their representatives in the House and Senate can\\'t get much done. Taking some of the heat out of those relationships seems like a good thing! But, like all things that seem good, this is bad. (OK, not  all  good things. But, realistically, most.) Here\\'s why. What Manchin is proposing is to take the politics out of politics. And to turn our two-party system into a single party system -- a party in which incumbency would be the common ideological thread between politicians. The clear winners if Manchin\\'s proposal was to be implemented would be the people already in office. By taking away a significant source of campaign cash from challengers -- and by starving the party campaign committees of money as well -- it would be that much harder for any candidate not already in office to come anywhere close to the financial might of an incumbent.  Remember that every trade association, every political action committee and every lobby shop has a vested interest in giving to incumbents so politicians in office would have no problem continuing to hoover up cash. Take away the ability to play on anything close to an even financial playing field and incumbent reelection rates, which are already sky high, would get even closer to 100%. Incumbents not badly damaged by scandal or too lazy to raise money would win. At the heart of Manchin\\'s proposal sits a false assumption: That politics -- and even polarization -- is, by default, bad.  It\\'s not. Like everything, too much politics and too much polarization is, of course, bad. But a proposal to eliminate -- or come close to eliminating the politics from politics -- is just as bad. We have two parties in this country for a reason. Republicans and Democrats, broadly speaking, have very real philosophical differences regarding the right role for government in the lives of average citizens. That doesn\\'t make one side right and the other wrong or one side evil and the other good. But it  does  make them different. And that\\'s totally fine!  Our current system is messy as hell. And highly inefficient. We lurch from crisis to crisis and call it governing. We say we want politicians who work across the aisle and then we punish them politically when they try. Outside groups have commercialized and monetized opposition for the sake of opposition. The extremes of both parties are now running things. This is all bad! And I commend Manchin for trying to come up with a creative way to fix it. Unfortunately, his proposal isn\\'t it. Pretending that the differences between the two parties are wholly a creation of campaign dollars and senators campaigning against one another simply misses the mark.  What the Manchin proposal would ensure is a political class living with almost no fear of political pain or retribution no matter what they did in office.  Incumbency would reign -- for as long as incumbents wanted it to, which would be forever. (Who among us would volunteer to leave a job we liked?) The entrenched political class would get even more entrenched.  None of that would help the current morass of our politics. In fact, if we put Manchin\\'s proposals in place today, I think things might actually get even worse.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Senate Republicans shouldn\\'t have a care in the world heading into the 2018 election.  Democrats are defending more than two dozen seats -- including 10 in states where President Donald Trump won in 2016 -- while Republicans have just 8 seats up for re-election. Those numbers led some ambitious Republicans to openly speculate about the possibility of controlling 60 seats -- a filibuster-proof majority-- after the 2018 election And yet, there are signs in just the last 48 hours that Senate GOP strategists are growing increasingly nervous about their chances of holding the majority. Consider: 1. In North Dakota, Republicans are desperately trying to change Rep. Kevin Cramer\\'s mind about challenging Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, in November,  according to the Washington Examiner\\'s David Drucker . Kramer decided against the race in January but Republicans have grown increasingly concerned about the remaining candidates in the race --  state Sen. Tom Campbell in particular -- and their ability to beat Heitkamp. 2. Some Republicans are pressuring Sen. Bob Corker to re-consider his decision to retire at the end of the 115th Congress --  as first reported by CNN . Corker has been silent about the speculation since the news broke over the weekend, meaning that he almost certainly is thinking twice about his previous decision. (If Corker wasn\\'t reconsidering, he could shut down all speculation with a simple \"No\" to any of the scads of reporters asking him if he is reconsidering.)  The concern among Washington Republicans is that Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the clear favorite for the Republican nomination, is  simply too conservative  to beat the popular former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen in the fall. Blackburn has said she is staying in the Senate race no matter what -- and there are some within the GOP who believe she would have the upper hand against Corker in a GOP primary. Those individual race anxieties are reflective of a broader concern among Senate Republicans that, despite their overwhelming numbers advantage, the combined weight of historical losses for the president\\'s party in midterms election and President Trump\\'s continued unpopularity nationally could endanger their majority come November. That concern has only deepened since the  Doug Jones beat Roy Moore  late last year to become the first Democrat to represent Alabama in the Senate in decades. Recruiting has been far more difficult than Republicans would have hoped. In addition to the saga in North Dakota, a top tier challenger has yet to emerge against Sen. Jon Tester in Montana, a state Trump won by double digits in 2016. In Ohio,  Josh Mandel, the Republican frontrunner, suddenly dropped his candidacy,  forcing Rep. Jim Renacci to switch from the governor\\'s race to the Senate contest. In Florida, every one is waiting on a go/no-go decision from Gov. Rick Scott; if he doesn\\'t run, Republicans will be a major underdog against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. In several other potential Republican takeovers, the party has struggled to clear the primary field. In Indiana and West Virginia, where Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly and Joe Manchin are imperiled, Republicans are headed toward what look like costly and expensive primary fights. Meanwhile, Republican chances in Nevada (where GOP Sen. Dean Heller is seeking reelection) and Arizona (where GOP Sen. Jeff Flake is not) remain very much up in the air, with potential ideological primaries forming in both.  None of this is to say Republicans will lose their majority come fall. The numbers -- still -- favor them. Republicans have, at most, three truly endangered seats right now (Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee). Democrats are still defending 10 seats where Trump won in 2016 including five -- Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia -- where the President won by double digits. But, the attempts to convince Kramer to change his mind coupled with efforts to coax Corker out of retirement are the latest evidence that an election cycle that looked like one of the best for Republicans in modern memory suddenly appears to be a bit more of a nail-biter.',\n",
       " 'Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) The two top leaders of the Senate sought to paint a picture of civility in a rare dual\\xa0appearance\\xa0outside the Capitol, following a year of\\xa0bitter fighting between the two parties in Congress over issues like tax cuts, health care and the Supreme Court. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\\xa0introduced his Democratic counterpart,\\xa0Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, before a speech Monday morning that\\xa0Schumer gave at the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville.  At the top of his speech, Schumer presented McConnell with a bottle of bourbon that was made in Brooklyn, where Schumer was born and raised. \"I\\'m sure he\\'ll never agree that New York bourbon even counts as bourbon,\" Schumer quipped.  Toward the end, the McConnell\\xa0Center\\xa0presented Schumer with a clock that has the\\xa0university\\'s emblem\\xa0on it.\\xa0\"Story of my life: Mitch gets the bourbon, I get the clock,\" Schumer\\xa0joked. It\\'s not unusual to see the two men together. They speak on a near daily basis on the Senate floor when they each deliver their opening remarks, and they are frequently involved in negotiations over legislative action that takes place on the floor.  But it\\'s not a common sight to see them \"take this show on the road,\" as McConnell teased at one point. While the two men acknowledged their differences, they attempted to keep the message focused on the recent  two-year budget deal  they struck and the upcoming immigration debate this week on the Senate floor.  The Senate will vote Monday night to  open up debate on a bill that will serve as the main vehicle for immigration legislation.  Members can propose amendments to the bill, but they must get at least 60 votes to pass -- a high hurdle that will require some bipartisanship, as the chamber is currently split 51 Republicans to 49 senators who caucus with the Democrats.  Schumer gave McConnell credit for holding an open floor debate on immigration,\\xa0and he\\xa0framed the Senate as the best chance to carry out \"the business of the country,\" describing the House as too \"fractious\" and saying with a shrug \"the President is the President.\"  He urged Trump to \"lead in a\\xa0bipartisan way\" and recalled his own involvement in the \"Gang of Eight\" immigration bill, saying many of the policies that people currently want were in that bill.\\xa0 Schumer,\\xa0however, didn\\'t hold back in his criticism of the other senator from\\xa0Kentucky, Rand Paul. He was asked during a Q&A portion by a member of the audience about Paul\\'s  opposition to the massive spending bill , which is expected to add to the deficit.  He said Paul\\'s\\xa0concerns about fiscal\\xa0responsibility \"ring very hollow\" because he\\xa0supported the tax bill that also increases the deficit. \"If you\\'re a deficit hawk, you got to be a\\xa0deficit\\xa0hawk all the way through,\" Schumer said.  Asked about Democratic strategy for the 2018 midterms, Schumer said his party can\\'t rely solely on public resistance to the President.  \"Our mistake, I think, you cannot just run against Donald Trump. It is the job of we Democrats to put together a strong cohesive economic group of proposals aimed at the middle class,\" he said, pointing to a rollout of policy proposals Democrats have been making since last summer.  This was the second time the McConnell Center has had both Senate leaders on the stage. The last time was in 2007 when former Sen. Harry Reid was a McConnell Center guest. When McConnell introduced Schumer, he said the center has had many interesting guests over the years but \"none more interesting than our guest this morning.\" The two men argued that their relationship was closer than it appears. \"We\\'re kind of like the offensive and defensive coordinators,\" McConnell said, joking that offensive\\xa0coordinator is a better position. \\xa0 \"Robust debate is not unusual,\" McConnell continued. \"But at every critical moment in this country, we\\'ve come together to do what is needed to be done to move the ball down the field.\" \"We really do get along despite what you read in the press,\" Schumer said.   There was no mention of Schumer voting against McConnell\\'s wife, Elaine Chao, in her nomination to become\\xa0transportation\\xa0secretary early last year, which was seen in the media as a major sign of partisanship in the immediate aftermath of Trump\\'s election. Nor was there in-depth discussion of the all-consuming legislative battles that rocked Capitol Hill in recent years.  Weighing in on what he sees as shared value with McConnell, Schumer said both men consider it their jobs to unify their respective members.    \"We have very diverse parties, he has a Susan Collins and Ted Cruz. We won\\'t say Rand Paul, we\\'re in Kentucky,\" Schumer said to laughs. \"I have Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin. I think what makes us most successful ... is to try and create unity in our caucuses.\" CNN\\'s Casey Riddle contributed to this report. ',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the longest serving Republican senator and a Senate traditionalist, told CNN Monday he will vote for the \"nuclear option\" if it\\'s needed to break a Democratic filibuster of Judge  Neil Gorsuch\\'s nomination  to the Supreme Court.  Hatch said the controversial procedural move, which would be instituted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, would be \"a very bad thing\" for the Senate -- but would be acceptable if it gets Gorsuch installed on the high court. The nuclear option  would change Senate rules to lower the threshold for breaking a filibuster of Supreme Court nominees from 60 votes to 51, meaning Republicans could advance Gorsuch without the support of any Democrats. Republicans would take the rare and contentious step over the objections of Democrats, who themselves changed the rules on Republicans in 2013 when they lowered the filibuster threshold for all other presidential appointments besides the Supreme Court.  Many Senate institutionalists worry that changing the filibuster rules would diminish the chamber\\'s role of finding bipartisan solutions to the nation\\'s problems and acting as the \"cooling saucer\" to the sometimes emotionally-charged actions  of the House, where rules allow the majority to dominate the minority.  RELATED: After lobbying from Trump, Orrin Hatch plans to run again Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Thursday that  Democrats would filibuster Gorsuch , meaning Republicans, who hold a 52-48 advantage, would have to pick up the support of eight Democrats to overcome the blocking procedure. \"I can\\'t believe that the Democrats would do that,\" said Hatch, a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee. \"I know there are a few radicals that might do that but I would think the vast majority would say this is a very good man.\" Only two Democrats -- Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota -- have signaled they might vote against a filibuster. Democratic leadership aides have said they expect most Democrats to support a filibuster, and many have already expressed their plans to do so. Meanwhile, some Democrats have said they oppose Gorsuch but haven\\'t spoken directly to whether they will filibuster him.  \"I will vote no on cloture,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from the blue state of Rhode Island and a vocal Gorsuch critic, speaking of the procedural motion involved.  RELATED: Here\\'s how senators plan to vote on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch But for senators from red and purple states, the calculus on Gorsuch is trickier.  \"I\\'m not going to talk about Gorsuch,\" said Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri as she blew past reporters on the way to vote.  McCaskill is under intense pressure by Republicans to vote to break a Gorsuch filibuster, and she\\'s up for re-election in a state won by President Donald Trump. Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana declined to answer reporters\\' questions Monday on Gorsuch, directing them to call his office instead. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who is also up for re-election, was less guarded. \"Probably (we\\'ll) have an announcement sometime either later this week or next week,\" he said calmly. \"Filibuster and the vote on him are the same in my book. It\\'s always been that way since I\\'ve been here.\" One senior Democratic senator, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, tweeted that he is not supporting Gorsuch\\'s confirmation, but at the same time he\\'s \"never inclined\" to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee.  \"I need to see how Judge Gorsuch answers my written Qs, under oath, before deciding,\" Leahy said on whether he\\'ll filibuster. The second-ranking Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, alled Leahy\\'s comments \"hopeful\" and said Republicans were trying to talk to some Democrats about preventing a filibuster. \"There are a number of conversations taking place. I don\\'t think we\\'re where we hope to be but they, I think, are putting off decisions until they know they have to vote,\" Cornyn said.  Hatch\\'s comments came the same day Republicans began a major push to get Gorsuch confirmed. The Senate was supposed to be focused on passing the repeal and replace bill for the Affordable Care Act,  but after it was surprisingly defeated in the House Friday , senators turned in earnest to Gorsuch a week earlier than anticipated.  RELATED: How Trump\\'s health care loss will shape his presidency The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to clear Gorsuch next Monday, and GOP leaders have vowed to have him confirmed by the end of that week, before leaving town for a two-week recess.  \"Look, we know that our Democratic friends are under an enormous amount of pressure from some on the far left who want them to resist. It\\'s clear that many radical special interest groups simply refuse to accept the results of the election and would like nothing more than to obstruct the serious work before the Senate,\" McConnell said on the floor. \"This much is clear: If our Democratic colleagues choose to hold up this nominee, then they\\'re acknowledging that they\\'ll go to any length to block any Supreme Court nominee of a Republican president. This isn\\'t about the nominee at all.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has negotiated resolutions during past Senate eruptions over judicial nominations, said he is prepared to vote for the nuclear option even though he would prefer not to. \"I think it would be bad for the Senate,\" he acknowledged.  But asked if he would try to head off the crisis as he has done before, Graham said: \"I don\\'t think so.\" Another long-serving Republican senator, Richard Shelby of Alabama, defended the use of the nuclear option. \"We have an outstanding nominee,\" Shelby said. \"If the Democrats want to filibuster I think we ought to make sure that he\\'s confirmed. Period.\" Asked if he was worried the changes to the filibuster rules would alter the Senate\\'s DNA, Shelby said no and blamed Democrats for using the nuclear option first. \"If you asked me that 10 years ago, I might have had a different opinion. But majorities rule. Majorities traditionally always rule. And remember the filibuster is not in the Constitution. It\\'s not in any statute. It\\'s not the law. It\\'s a rule,\" he said. \"Democrats have already broken the rule.\" Headed to votes Monday evening, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, another veteran senator with a reputation for working across the aisle, was not interested in talking about the nuclear option after reporters peppered him with questions about the failed health care bill. \"Let\\'s do one thing at a time,\" a slightly flustered Alexander said, before he walked away from reporters.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) 97%. That\\'s the percentage of people in a new Quinnipiac University national poll who say they support \"requiring background checks for all gun buyers.\" 97%. If you asked people whether water is wet, you might not get 97% of them to say that it is.\\xa0 Democrats (99%), Republicans (97%), independents (98%), men (96%), women (98%), 18- to 34-year-olds (99%) and those 65+ (98%) all overwhelmingly support making a background check a requirement for anyone trying to purchase a gun. And yet, attempts to provide legislative fixes to some of the issues with the background check system have run aground in years past. The biggest failure came in 2013, following the murder of more than two dozen people, including schoolchildren, in late 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School.  A bill that would have expanded background checks  failed to gain the 60 votes required in the Senate. Ditto a bipartisan compromise bill offered by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania. In 2017,  following a shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas , Senate Majority Whip  John Cornyn, R-Texas, along with Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, offered legislation  that would force states to comply with regulations for updating the\\xa0National Instant Criminal Background Check System. It went nowhere. That bill appears to have gained a second life over the weekend, with  President Donald Trump seemingly signaling support for it  -- or something very like it. If past is prologue, however, you would be right to be leery that last week\\'s shooting in Parkland, Florida -- and even the outspoken calls to action from students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\\xa0-- will prompt significant action from Congress. Which is, if you stop and think about it, totally baffling.\\xa0\\xa0 Politicians are in the business of getting re-elected every two or six years. One way to do that is to take actions that are broadly popular with the public. And you don\\'t get much more popular than 97% of people supporting something -- like requiring background checks. So why doesn\\'t anything get done?\\xa0 Because of the National Rifle Association\\'s striking success in selling the slippery slope argument. The NRA has convinced its members -- and the many members of Congress the organization donates to -- that allowing any sort of movement toward more gun control is an inevitable step to someone from the government coming along to collect your guns. The Point : The all-or-nothing dynamic that has dominated gun politics for the past two-plus decades ill serves a public that clearly is able to differentiate between gun collection and requiring background checks. It\\'s a depressing reality of our politics.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) There\\'s a lot of talk. There are plenty of proposals. But at the moment, there are no actual plans for Congress to pass tighter gun laws. Could that change? Of course. But as it stands, Republican leadership, which has been intentionally silent on policy proposals since the Florida shooting, is waiting to hear from their respective conferences before moving (or not moving) on anything.  Bottom line:  Republican sources with direct knowledge of the current state of play express significant skepticism of anything major happening legislatively. At most, they expect some push for the \"Fix NICS\" (short for National Instant Criminal Background Check System) bill sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, combined with some type of financial package. Even that, they acknowledge, may be a bridge too far.  The wildcard: It\\'s President Donald Trump. Period. If he demands legislative action on something  specific , beyond his ambiguous 280-character ideas, that would change the calculations of GOP leaders. But keep the proper perspective on this -- it would not, per sources, shift GOP leaders in a way that sets up substantive gun control legislation for consideration. Instead, it will have the effect of forcing them to just do something.  Multiple sources express skepticism that the President will stick with this long enough to force the hands of GOP congressional leaders. But so far, he certainly has. Other proposals that are out there at the moment:  - A background checks bill sponsored by Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, and Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia. (Aides say this doesn\\'t have 60 votes and has zero chance in the House.) - A draft proposal by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, and Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, to raise the purchase age for long guns. (Aides say this doesn\\'t have 60 votes in the Senate and has zero chance in the House.) - An assault weapons ban. (Aides say this doesn\\'t have 60 votes in the Senate and has zero chance in the House.) Read:  Lauren Fox and Ted Barrett\\'s  excellent rundown  of the (very complicated) electoral and policy dynamics facing this debate in an election year (spoiler: it\\'s not just Republicans who are wary of this policy debate):  What to watch Monday: Taking the temperature of the rank and file as the return in the House and Senate for votes this evening. What to expect Monday night: Florida Sens. Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat, are tentatively planning to call for unanimous consent to move the bipartisan \"Fix NICS\" bill. Leadership aides tell me to expect this to be blocked. (Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky still have known concerns with the bill.)  Along those lines: Keep an eye on Democrats, in both the House and Senate, trying to force votes on measures in both chambers. Take these for what they are -- efforts designed to increase pressure on the majority, but with zero chance of actually going anywhere.  What really matters:   Tuesday is the day to keep a close eye on. House Republicans will hold a closed-door conference meeting in the morning. Senate Republicans will hold their policy lunch in the afternoon. What the respective leaders say after those meetings will determine what, if anything, happens next.  Just a reminder:  The House will be out of session by Tuesday afternoon. The Senate already has a series of judicial nominations cued up for consideration throughout the week. The idea that something substantive is happening this week is very unlikely.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said Sunday that the effort to stem mass shootings like the one in Parkland, Florida, needs to go beyond focusing on law enforcement and encompass a comprehensive approach to gun control and mental health. \"You can\\'t suppose every single time that you\\'re going to be able to intervene before the shooter walks into a school with a military-style assault weapon,\" Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said on CNN\\'s \"State of the Union\" Sunday morning when asked what he thought about the law enforcement response to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting last week. During the mass shooting at the Parkland, Florida, high school, one of the Broward County deputies waited outside the building and later resigned after being suspended without pay for his actions.  Murphy also acknowledged that the gunman in Parkland exhibited several warning signs that were flagged to law enforcement officials.  \"There clearly are a lot of questions that need to be answered about why law enforcement didn\\'t step in earlier in Florida. But there are just as many of these shootings that look like Sandy Hook, where there were no red flags,\" the senator said.  Murphy, an outspoken advocate for gun control, was previously a House member representing the district that encompassed Newtown, Connecticut, during the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.  \"As much as we all would have liked this school security officer to act differently, once you\\'re in the position where you\\'re hoping the school security guard or a gym teacher decides to take a pistol to somebody with a military-style assault weapon, public policy has failed,\" Murphy said. \"You should be passing laws to stop that kind of horrific incident from happening in the first place.\"  Murphy added that he doesn\\'t think \"you can just assume that better law enforcement response is going to quell the epidemic of gun violence in this country.\" The senator is set to meet with President Donald Trump this week, potentially to highlight his bipartisan bill with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to reform the background checks system.  \"I was encouraged that President Trump said he\\'s in favor of comprehensive background checks,\" Murphy said. \"I\\'m not sure if he knows what that means. That generally means universal background checks applying to all commercial sales, but he has not backtracked on that tweet since he made it.\"  Murphy said the approach to the issue must be comprehensive.  \"I think there\\'s this false construct that\\'s created that either you need to work on mental health and identifying shooters ahead of time or you have to focus on strengthening our gun laws. That\\'s not true. You need to do all of it,\" he said.  On television on Sunday, some Republicans agreed with Murphy.  Florida GOP Gov. Rick Scott said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he disagrees with the President\\'s proposal to arm teachers.  \"I want our teachers to teach. I want our law enforcement officers to be able to protect the students. I want each group to focus on what they\\'re good at,\" Scott said. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania spoke about a bill he introduced with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to expand background checks for gun purchases, saying on  NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press \" that the bill they introduced is \"not going to solve all problems, and we never suggest that it would.\"  \"One of the challenges that we face is what to do about someone who is clearly mentally deranged, but they haven\\'t acted out yet in a way that allows you to adjudicate them as dangerously mentally ill or they haven\\'t committed a crime,\" Toomey continued, adding that \"there\\'s an important discussion to be had about a temporary restraining order.\" But some Sunday show guests called for less focus on gun laws and background checks:  Dana Loesch, National Rifle Association spokesperson, on  ABC\\'s \"This Week\" : \"I wish that as much attention were given to the Broward County sheriff and their abdication of duty as trying to blame 5 million innocent, law-abiding gun owners all across the country.\" Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky said on  NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press\"  that more gun laws are \"false senses of security,\" adding that increased background checks are like putting \"lipstick on a pig.\"',\n",
       " ' (CNN) The Senate voted Thursday to roll back the Stream Protection Rule, an Obama administration regulation aimed at curbing waste from coal mines from entering waterways but that Republicans complained was an onerous job killer in coal country.  The 54-to-45 vote was largely along party lines though four red state Democrats supported it and one moderate Republican voted against it.  The vote came out one day after the measure passed the House 228-194, sending the bill to President Donald Trump\\'s desk. This is the first of what is expected to be dozens of environmental, financial disclosure and energy rules put in place by Obama in the last weeks of his tenure that the GOP leaders on the Hill plan to undue using a special legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act. Trump is expected to sign each of the measures. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, a vocal advocate for the thousands of coal miners in his state, decried the stream rule as a \"an 11th hour parting salvo in the Obama Administration\\'s war on coal families that could threaten one-third of America\\'s coal mining jobs.\" Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from coal-heavy West Virginia, defended cutting the regulation, telling CNN\\'s Jake Tapper that supporters of the rule \"don\\'t understand how it works.\" \"EPA will have control. So will the Corps of Engineers,\" Manchin said, calling the Stream Protection Rule \"needless\" and \"duplicated.\"  But Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic Whip, called repealing the regulation part of \"Trump\\'s war on clean drinking water.\" \"Shame on us if we decide to eliminate this protection for families and run the risk, the very real risk, the pollution in those streams could cause public health issues,\" he said on the floor just before the vote.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) The nation is reeling after a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School  that killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida . But if there is a feeling that something is about to change on gun control in the rest of the country, it\\'s not yet palpable on Capitol Hill. As lawmakers filed in after a weeklong recess, Republicans and some Democrats appeared reluctant to wade in too publicly or too quickly on a topic as contentious and politically rife as gun control. \"I don\\'t think we need more gun control. I think we need better idiot control,\" Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana said when asked what might come next on Capitol Hill. Even modest proposals quickly hit roadblocks Monday. A plan to incentivize states and federal agencies to enter more records into the country\\'s gun background check system  known as Fix NICs  seemed too little for Democrats while Republicans maintained it was the best first step they could offer. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, blocked the bill from coming up under a fast-track process in the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, meanwhile,  released a statement Monday afternoon calling any plan to just vote on Fix NICs  without more robust proposals  \"abject failure\" and a \"dereliction of our duty.\" \"Democrats believe that, at a minimum, the congressional response to the Parkland shooting should include universal background check legislation that would close the gun show and internet sales loopholes that allow guns to fall into the wrong hands,\" Schumer said. But some Republicans weren\\'t even ready to accept the narrow plan to add more data to the background check system. \"I basically believe the Second Amendment is important to all of us and how do we work within the Second Amendment, OK?\" Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby said. In the week Congress was gone, the country  began the most robust dialogue it has had on gun control  since the aftermath of a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 with governors and even a handful of Republican members of Congress publicly re-examining past positions on high-capacity magazines, background checks and the age at which an individual can purchase a rifle. \"There\\'s always political risk, but at the same time, we\\'re talking about the lives of kids and innocent men and women and people,\" said Republican Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, in town for a gathering of the nation\\'s governors. \"We need to have this difficult conversation and get it out in the light of day.\" But on Monday evening it seemed little, if anything, would change in the way of an appetite to tackle gun control on Capitol Hill. Asked if he supported raising the age that individuals could purchase rifles from 18 to 21 or banning bump fire stocks, devices that make it possible to fire semiautomatic weapons like automatic ones, Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said, \"I\\'m not very enthused about those. \" And on the Fix NICS proposal? \"I have trouble with anything in that area because I\\'ve always been a strong proponent of the right to keep and bear arms,\" Hatch said. And it wasn\\'t just Republicans who were divided. The Democratic Party, which has 10 senators who are up for re-election in 2018 in states that Trump won and a number of senators on the left of the debate who may run for President in 2020, was trying to find its own agreement. Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat up for re-election in 2018 in Montana, said he thought there was still room for debate on guns.  \"It depends on where the gun debate goes,\" he said when asked if he worried about the effects it might have on red state Democrats. \"I think keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, mentally ill folks, terrorists, that\\'s solid ground.  There are not law-abiding citizens, they ought not have the same rights as law abiding citizens, all right?\" Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia up for re-election in 2018, argued that in the era of Trump, he thought there was even more room to act. He argued the Senate should re-examine a bill he sponsored in 2013 that would have expanded background checks to gun sales at gun shows and on the internet. \"Common sense still prevails. Manchin-Toomey was common sense back then,\" Manchin said about his push for the background check bill in 2013. \"The reason we were not able to get the support we needed was because they were afraid President Obama would go further. Well, they\\'re not having that fear with President Trump, so if he wants a good piece of legislation that protects Second Amendment rights, this one protects it better than any legislation that\\'s out there and it\\'s been vetted for five years. So we\\'ll have to see what the President wants to do. It\\'s really up to him.\" All eyes are on President Donald Trump and whether he -- who pushed to make changes to some of the country\\'s gun laws last week including raising the age for buying rifles and enforcing background checks -- will continue that effort. Over the weekend, Trump spoke over the phone with House Speaker Paul Ryan about the gun issue. And Trump told reporters Monday he lunched with National Rifle Association leaders Wayne LaPierre and Chris Cox over the weekend. Monday morning, Trump told governors at the White House that  the NRA was on their side. \"Don\\'t worry about the NRA, they\\'re on our side,\" Trump said. \"Half of you are so afraid of the NRA, there\\'s nothing to be afraid of.\" \"And you know what? If they\\'re not with you, we have to fight \\'em every once in a while, that\\'s OK. They\\'re doing what they think is right,\" he said. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida who\\'d spent the previous week with victims from the Parkland shooting, said Monday he\\'d seen a sea change happening in Florida. But in Washington? he was asked. \"I can\\'t tell you that,\" he said. \"I don\\'t know. Ask me that question in a couple of days.\" CNN\\'s Deirdre Walsh, Eric Bradner, Noah Gray and Sarah Mucha contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Detroit (CNN) Gobsmacked by their base\\'s ferocious rejection of Donald Trump\\'s presidency, the candidates to chair the Democratic Party scrambled Saturday to show how devoted they are to the cause. Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez bragged to the Democratic National Committee\\'s \"future forum\" about racing to airport protests in Houston and then San Francisco. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, made sure everyone knew he was the only one to skip David Brock\\'s donor summit to participate in the Women\\'s March in Washington. Put him in charge, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison pledged, and \"We will be asking Democrats all over the country, \\'Bring coffee to the marches. Be in the marches yourself. Carry a sign.\\' \" As for those white rural and exurban voters who so brutally rejected Democrats in November -- well, bringing them back into the fold is also a priority for those vying to lead the party.  If the base allows it.  After three weeks of anti-Trump protests, Democrats are still stunned by the sudden burst of energy. The party\\'s organs are all racing to keep up as dozens of events pop up -- often on Facebook, without any party chapter or progressive organization\\'s involvement at all -- each weekend.  \"The activism of people who are concerned about the Trump administration\\'s threat to the country is very energizing to us,\" said US Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee and one of the swing-state senators up for re-election in 2018. \"We don\\'t view that as threatening -- we love the energy.\"  The energy, though, is all rooted in ferocious opposition to Trump -- the same strategy that failed Hillary Clinton in 2016. That reality has some Democrats on Capitol Hill fretting that the rising anti-Trump fervor is putting the party at risk of papering over the same problems with voters in rural and exurban America they woke up with on November 9. \"If you can\\'t get them back to where they\\'re looking and thinking, \\'The Democratic Party still represents me,\\' then you\\'ll always be in the minority,\" said US Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia.  \"The anger that people feel is righteous and justified, but it can\\'t just be a party against Mr. Trump,\" said US Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia.  \"I understand the righteous anger against some of the President\\'s policies, but we also need to lay out a narrative that\\'s more than just a series of position papers -- that gives us an overarching theme,\" Warner said. \"And that\\'s what I\\'m looking for.\" The 2018 map vs. the base\\'s demands Manchin and nine other Senate Democrats are up for re-election in 2018 in states that Trump won.  Four of those Democrats -- Indiana\\'s Joe Donnelly, Missouri\\'s Claire McCaskill, North Dakota\\'s Heidi Heitkamp and Montana\\'s Jon Tester -- are in states where Trump crushed Clinton.  Just how much latitude those senators need -- and should be given by the base on votes like Cabinet and Supreme Court confirmations -- is the challenge confronting Democrats now, as the party frantically searches for ways to protect those red-state Democrats without jeopardizing the base\\'s energy and enthusiasm.   Meanwhile, much of the base is demanding total opposition to Trump -- no matter the political costs for Democrats in red states.  And there are no sacred cows, as US Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, learned when she voted in committee to confirm Ben Carson for Housing and Urban Development secretary. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, was the target of protective protesters who recently marched to his home, chanting an expletive that rhymed with his first name.  These progressives see the party\\'s future in energizing women, minorities and young people in cities and suburbs -- particularly in Sun Belt states, including Georgia and Arizona. \"Those working-class white voters aren\\'t the future of the party,\" said Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the liberal blog DailyKos.com, which has already raised $400,000 for a Democratic candidate in the expected runoff for the US House seat in Georgia soon to be vacated by Tom Price, Trump\\'s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. \"Most of them are stuck in fake-news land anyway, and no amount of reality will penetrate that bubble. They think 1.5 million people attended Trump\\'s inauguration. They think Obama only needed 50 votes to pass his Supreme Court nominees,\" Moulitsas said. \"They\\'re lost. It\\'s a waste of time to try and win them back when there are so many core-Democratic-base who didn\\'t register or vote last cycle. Almost half the country didn\\'t vote, and the bulk of the non-voters were liberal-leaning people many of them now marching in the streets. \"So instead of trying to chase people trapped by Breitbart and its cohorts in conservative media, give them a reason to get excited about rallying around Democrats,\" he said.  Alternate political universes Democrats\\' short-term fate, though, rests in part on whether the party can hold onto Senate seats in Trump states.  In those areas, senators are struggling to wrap their minds around the alternate universes of the Trump presidency so far.  In one -- where the women\\'s marches, airport protests and pro-Obamacare town hall turnout are the dominant storylines and former alt-right Breitbart news executive Steve Bannon is seen as a shadow president -- Trump has walked himself into repeated controversies and revealed himself to be just what the Clinton campaign warned he was.  In another -- where rural and exurban voters with little economic opportunity sought to send someone to shake up a political world they thought had lost touch with their needs -- Trump has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, jumpstarted the Keystone pipeline, taken steps toward renegotiating other trade deals, hosted top labor union leaders at the White House and is fulfilling some of his top campaign promises.  \"You folks have been terrific to me,\" Trump told union representatives as they joined Harley-Davidson executives in a recent meeting at the White House. \"Sometimes your top people didn\\'t support me but the steelworkers supported me.\"  Many left-leaning organizations are still trying to feel their ways around the new White House.  \"It\\'s like \\'Game of Thrones\\' right now in the Trump administration -- it\\'s kind of hard to tell who\\'s going to come out on top,\" said Thea Lee, the AFL-CIO\\'s deputy chief of staff. US Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who represents many of those \"downriver\" voters, said she is focused on how to use language that makes clear that \"I am inclusive of everybody, but I\\'m also fighting for those UAW workers who think we\\'ve forgotten them, or those Teamsters whose pensions are being threatened to be cut.\" Dingell added: \"Those are our constituents who we have to be a voice for, too. We\\'ve got to find a way to talk about it so they know we are the fighters for them and that we will stand strong, and that we care about those issues.\" The populist solution Increasingly, Democrats are moving toward a message styled after populist stalwarts such as Warren, Bernie Sanders and US Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Their case: The problem wasn\\'t Trump\\'s promises, or what his campaign represented -- it\\'s that in office, he\\'s promoting his billionaire friends and failing to take care of those who carried him to the presidency. US Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, another Democrat up for re-election in 2018, said 9,000 people turned out in January at a pro-Obamacare rally in Macomb County -- a key swing region that helped tip Michigan for Trump. \"There were people that I know that attended that supported President Trump that didn\\'t really believe he was going to take away their health care or cut their Medicare,\" she said. \"People thought they were voting for change, and now are saying, \\'Wait a minute, I didn\\'t mean that.\\'  \"I\\'m still fighting for the same people in Michigan that want a shot to stay in the middle class,\" Stabenow said. \"I think this is really more about (communicating) that.\"  Other Democrats made a similar argument -- saying the activist energy is increasingly pushing them toward populist policies.  US Rep. Cheri Bustos, an Illinois Democrat who easily won in a district Trump carried, said the party\\'s problems can be addressed partially through simple moves such as \"supermarket Saturdays,\" job-shadowing blue-collar workers and sitting through lengthy appearances on rural radio stations.  \"We\\'ve also got to make sure that we\\'re disciplined about what our values are. We know that our policies resonate with people -- with these folks who want to try Trump,\" she said.  \"Our theory right now is that they\\'re going to have buyer\\'s remorse -- that they tried him because they wanted something different; they were tired of the status quo; they felt left behind by this wage stagnation,\" Bustos said. \"We have the right policies to address that. But we haven\\'t always gone deep into the kind of districts where people have felt left behind.\" The Supreme Court problem A particular cause of heartburn for red-state Democratic senators is the upcoming confirmation battle over Trump\\'s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.  It was, after all, the expectation that Trump would appoint conservative justices -- whose tenures would long outlast his presidency -- that kept many moderate Republicans behind his candidacy.  It\\'s a conundrum: Do Democrats risk undercutting their own cause by waging war over Trump\\'s most conventional decision yet?  So Senate Democrats are slow-walking their way around Gorsuch, promising to give him due consideration -- buying themselves more time to figure out whether they have 41 out of 48 Democratic votes necessary to block him, and whether it\\'s even the fight they want.  \"Explaining anything having to do with courts or law is a challenge -- not because it\\'s inconsequential but because it can\\'t be dramatized with a picture and a face and a voice,\" said US Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut.  \"So we need to make sure the American people understand what\\'s at stake,\" Blumenthal said. \"The gobbledygook and the legal jargon are very confusing. And just now as I\\'m talking to you, I\\'m realizing that I\\'m sort of going off into the ether.\"  Moulitsas said red-state Democrats should forget using those votes to try to prove themselves as moderates.  The likes of Donnelly and Heitkamp \"aren\\'t going to win re-election on the strength of Trump voters impressed by their confirmation votes,\" he said. \"The best chance they have to win in their tough states will be by riding this incredible wave of energy. It may not be enough, but pissing off the base certainly isn\\'t the better bet. You either ride in with the people who brought you, or go down fighting honorably,\" Moulitsas said. \"Pretending to be a \\'Republican, but a little less bad\\' has never inspired a dramatic re-election victory.\" ',\n",
       " ' (CNN) Take a look at the week in politics from February 11 through February 17. President Donald Trump pauses as he arrives to  address the nation  Thursday, a day after a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, left 17 dead. Trump stressed the need to address mental health issues in the country but steered clear of any discussion of gun laws in the United States. Trump and first lady Melania Trump visit Broward Health North Hospital, where many of the victims of Wednesday\\'s school shooting in Parkland, Florida, are being treated. The Trumps visited Friday \"to pay their respects and thank the medical professionals for their life-saving assistance\" in response to shooting, the White House said. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein answers a question after  announcing  Friday that special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for allegedly meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The sweeping indictment describes in detail an unprecedented campaign by Russia to influence the election, affirming the long-standing conclusions of the US intelligence community. It is at odds with President Donald Trump\\'s repeated questioning of those conclusions, which has continued throughout his first year in office. Former President Barack Obama\\'s portrait was  unveiled  Monday at the Smithsonian\\'s National Portrait Gallery. The former president chose Kehinde Wiley to make the portrait. Wiley is a Yale University-trained painter famous for his depiction of African-Americans posed in the style of Old Master paintings, regal, formal and filled with pops of color. Wiley is also the first African-American artist to execute an official presidential portrait for the National Portrait Gallery. The official portrait of former first lady Michelle Obama was  also unveiled  Monday at the National Portrait Gallery. The former first lady chose Baltimore-based artist Amy Sherald to make the portrait. Sherald is an African-American artist whose portraits tend to underscore themes of social justice. Sherald often paints black skin tones in gray as a way to take away the \"color\" of her subjects. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon arrives at a closed-door meeting Thursday with the House Intelligence Committee. The top Democrat on the committee said Friday  it\\'s likely that Bannon will be held in contempt of Congress  after refusing to answer questions before the panel. Republican Rep. Mike Conaway, who runs the panel\\'s Russia investigation, declined to say whether Bannon should be held in contempt. Former Trump campaign adviser Rick Gates departs the courthouse in Washington with his lawyer Wednesday. Gates is  finalizing a plea deal  with special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s office, indicating he\\'s poised to cooperate in the investigation, according to sources familiar with the case. Once a plea deal is in place, Gates would become the third known cooperator in Mueller\\'s probe. Gates pleaded not guilty on October 30 to Mueller\\'s indictment alongside Trump\\'s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The President and first lady arrive in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday to meet with the victims of the Parkland mass shooting, as well law enforcement officials and first responders. FBI Director Christopher Wray appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday for a hearing on worldwide threats. Wray  upended the White House\\'s timeline  about when it learned of domestic abuse allegations leveled against now-former White House staff secretary Rob Porter. Copies of Trump\\'s fiscal year 2019 budget request, An American Budget, are displayed at the Government Publishing Office library in Washington on Monday. The Trump administration  outlined its policy priorities  in the budget, calling for billions of dollars to fight the opioid epidemic, secure the country\\'s borders and overhaul safety net programs. Sen. Susan Collins talks to Sen. Joe Manchin as Sen. Jeff Flake looks on during a news conference at Capitol Hill on Thursday. The Senate  failed to advance a bipartisan deal  that would have paired a pathway to citizenship for nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children with $25 billion in border security and some other measures, leaving talks seemingly back at square one.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi attends a news conference Thursday, the day after a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Pelosi  said  Congress has a \"moral responsibility to take common-sense action to prevent the daily tragedy of gun violence in communities across America.\"  US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attends a regional summit in Kuwait City with members of the US-led coalition fighting ISIS on Tuesday to discuss the reconstruction of Iraq after the defeat of ISIS. Baghdad  estimates  reconstruction will cost $88 billion. Tillerson visited Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey during his Middle East tour this week.  Vice President Mike Pence looks at an exhibit during his visit to the Smithsonian\\'s National Museum of African American History and Culture on Tuesday. The President and first lady hosted a reception Tuesday at the White House  honoring Black History Month . National Sheriffs\\' Association President Harold Eavenson looks on as President Trump speaks during a meeting with the association in the White House on Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Leader Chuck Schumer speaks after he was  introduced by his Republican counterpart , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, at the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville on Monday. While the two men acknowledged their differences following a year of bitter fighting between the two parties in Congress, they attempted to keep the message in the event focused on the recent two-year budget deal they struck and the immigration debate on the Senate floor. The Senate failed to advance an immigration deal on Thursday. Sen. David Perdue fist-bumps Sen. Joni Ernst as Sen. Thom Tillis looks on prior to a news conference on immigration Monday. A group of Republican senators  introduced a version of President Trump\\'s proposal  that included granting a pathway to citizenship to the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children and who were covered by DACA, as well as more than $25 billion for border security, hardline immigration enforcement and substantial cuts to legal immigration.

       " 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump\\'s Supreme Court team whisked nominee Neil Gorsuch to the Capitol Wednesday in a packed day that amounted to one part victory lap and another part listening tour as Republicans try to gauge whether Democrats will attempt a filibuster.  Top Democrats delivered a spitfire response to Gorsuch\\'s selection Wednesday, but the senators as a group remain far from unified. Liberal stalwarts stopped just shy of flatly calling for a filibuster of Gorsuch -- instead sticking close to a message that the nominee should win the support of at least 60 senators before he is guaranteed a vote in the Senate. Republicans see a clear opening to divide Democrats by focusing on the 10 Senate Democrats who represent states Trump won just months ago and face re-election in less than two years. Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat likely to face a tough re-election battle, said she was still deciding whether to support Gorsuch. \"I can\\'t imagine I would vote for cloture if I don\\'t want him to be the nominee,\" she told CNN.  And Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, another Democrat being targeted by Republicans, said he was still reviewing Gorsuch\\'s record but, like McCaskill, would not vote to end a filibuster if he ultimately opposed the nominee.  \"If I don\\'t like the guy, I won\\'t vote for cloture,\" he said.  From the right, conservative groups have bought ads in the home states of Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly (Indiana), Heidi Heitkamp (North Dakota) and others. While on the left, major Democratic operatives launched pressed the same Democrats to fight Gorsuch. Guy Cecil, the chairman of the Democratic group Priorities USA, sent an email directed at many of the senators he previously helped elect with the subject line \"Too dangerous not to resist.\" Vice President Mike Pence and former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, meanwhile, led Gorsuch on a tour through the Capitol Wednesday, meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Cory Gardner and others, including Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Manchin, one of 10 Democrats explicitly targeted by Republicans, urged his Democratic colleagues not to hold Garland\\'s treatment against Gorsuch. \"That\\'s not what we were sent here to do. That\\'s not what I\\'m going to do,\"  Manchin said Wednesday . \"I\\'m anxious to sit down with the new nominee to find out more about him.\" Trump pushes \\'nuclear option\\' But Trump himself has urged Republicans to exercise the \"nuclear option\" -- lowering the threshold to break a filibuster of a Supreme Court pick from 60 to 51 -- if Democrats attempt to block Gorsuch. \"If we end up with that gridlock I would say if you can, Mitch, go nuclear,\"  Trump said of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . \"That would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web.\" Senate Republican leaders declined Wednesday to say whether thought they would need to use the \"nuclear option.\" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said \"it\\'s too early. I don\\'t know.\" But the Trump administration was optimistic Wednesday that it may get to the 60 votes needed to avoid a showdown, saying it saw more paths to Gorsuch\\'s confirmation than simply through vulnerable Democrats.  A White House aide noted that Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin\\'s comments Tuesday that he wanted a vote for Gorsuch -- clear opposition to a filibuster -- could be based on Durbin\\'s support for maintaining the Senate\\'s historical decorum.  Democrats upset about Garland In many ways, the mere pageantry of parading the high court nominee through the Capitol was a stinging reminder for Democrats of Republicans\\' successful blockade of Merrick Garland last year.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will vet Gorsuch, said Wednesday that Garland had been \"humiliated\" by Republicans. \"There still is a lot of feeling on our side as to what happened with Judge Merrick Garland. He should not have been humiliated. He should not have been rebuked,\" Feinstein told CNN\\'s Raju. Only a handful of Republican senators even agreed to meet with Garland after Obama nominated him -- other Republicans explained they saw no point in meeting with him if they wouldn\\'t be voting for him.  While Gorsuch met with Gardner Wednesday, a senator from his home state of Colorado, reporters fired off a few questions about his prospects. But the two men continued their conversation about football.',\n",
       " 'On the plus side, Jason Carter\\'s got serious name recognition. The grandson of former President Jimmy Carter is running for governor in the same state his grandfather led before winning the White House.\\xa0 ADVERTISEMENT But on the downside for him, the younger Carter is running as a moderate in deep-red Georgia -- which doesn\\'t exactly jibe with the ex-president\\'s legacy.\\xa0 Jason Carter, a state senator who announced his bid for governor a month ago, is already running into problems as he tries to distance himself from his grandfather\\'s liberal reputation. Carter may benefit in part from the family name -- and Georgia\\'s growing minority population which could eventually change the state\\'s solid Republican status -- but Republicans are trying to defeat the candidate by reconnecting him to the family.\\xa0 \"Jason has a lot to overcome in regards to his family name in a traditionally red state,\" Republican strategist Joe Desilets told FoxNews.com.\\xa0 For now, Carter must convince an electorate that has installed a Republican governor, a GOP-led General Assembly and twice as many Republicans as Democrats on Capitol Hill.\\xa0 Within days of announcing his campaign in early November, Carter was already distancing himself from a recent call by his grandfather, also a former Georgia governor, to end the state\\'s death-penalty sentences.\\xa0 \"I love my grandfather,\" the 38-year-old Carter told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"But we disagree on this issue. I believe in the death penalty for heinous crimes, and that won\\'t change when I\\'m governor.\"\\xa0 Carter, a moderate state senator, is the first Democratic candidate to enter the gubernatorial race, potentially clearing the primary field for himself to challenge incumbent Republican Gov. Nathan Deal in the November 2014 general election.\\xa0 An internal poll by Alabama-based firm Anzalone Liszt Grove Research conducted in mid-October showed Carter might have an opening. It showed 49 percent of respondents preferring a new governor, compared with 36 percent wanting to re-elect Deal.\\xa0 And Carter trailed Deal by just single digits in a head-to-head race, according to the poll results, released Nov. 12 and obtained by FoxNews.com.\\xa0 While the elder Carter\\'s popularity has grown since leaving the White House, as is often the case with ex-presidents, Republicans and Democrats have not forgotten that his controversial liberal policies opened the door for Ronald Reagan to defeat him in 1980.\\xa0 \"If Jason Carter\\'s campaign looks to place an emphasis on his grandfather being a former president ... then they can\\'t wrap themselves in the good and distance themselves from the bad,\" Deal campaign manager Tom Willis told Politico. \"We are sure everyone in the Carter family is anxious to see what a 2014 referendum on President Carter\\'s administration will look like. We look forward to that referendum as well.\"\\xa0 Desilets argues President Carter\\'s personal involvement in the grandson\\'s previous campaigns \"also limits the distance that Jason is legitimately able to put between himself and his grandfather.\"\\xa0 He said: \"If Governor Deal and the [Republican Governors Association] can tie Jason to his grandfather, then he has even more of an uphill battle than he already has against a popular incumbent governor.\"\\xa0 Carter, who has already staked out a centrist position that focuses on education and the economy, will also have to overcome a substantial fundraising disadvantage against Deal whose campaign for a second term had $1.1 million this summer, according to the most recent fundraising records.\\xa0 Carter had $27,800 in his General Assembly filings, over the same period.\\xa0 Desilets thinks the disparity will be compounded by the likelihood that big money from state and national Democratic donors will go first to the U.S. Senate race in which they think Michelle Nunn, the daughter of former Democratic Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, has a legitimate shot at winning GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss\\' open seat.',\n",
       " 'States aren\\'t giving the Obama administration any rest, filing a 24-state lawsuit on Tuesday against its rules for new power plants, after 26 states sued last month to oppose the Clean Power Plan. ADVERTISEMENT The latest suit being led by West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey asks the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals \"to strike down the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s new source performance standards [or New Source rule], which effectively prohibits the construction of new, coal-fired power plants.\" Many of the states joining the New Source challenge are also opposing the Clean Power Plan, which is the centerpiece of President Obama\\'s climate agenda. The plan requires states to reduce carbon emissions a third by 2030, which states argue oversteps the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s authority and the U.S. Constitution. Many scientists blame greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels for driving manmade climate change. Morrisey argues that the New Source rule relies on \"experimental technology\" that makes it cost-prohibitive to build any coal plants in the country. The technology, known as carbon capture and storage, is too \"expensive and unproven on a commercial scale\" to be mandated for new coal-fired generators.',\n",
       " 'Just hours before his first address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, a cheery President Trump posed for pictures with roughly 20 Republican attorneys general. \"These are some great people here,\" the president said – fully aware that the AGs are in the midst of filing a flurry of lawsuits against the Trump administration. ADVERTISEMENT Why? \"Sometimes it turns out the best way to help President Trump ... is to sue President Trump,\" Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley explained to Fox News. Despite the unusual optics of all these lawsuits, the intention of Hawley and the other AGs is to use the suits to block federal regulations, mostly promulgated during the Obama administration but now in effect under Trump\\'s. In Missouri,\\xa0this legal tactic centers on an endangered prehistoric fish that has outlived the dinosaurs, the Pallid Sturgeon.\\xa0It reproduces in river shallows which have become fewer, due to the diking and channeling of the Missouri River. To resurrect the fish population, an Obama-era amendment to the Endangered Species Act allows the feds to designate as critical habitat areas where the fish may not even exist. The amendment was designed to expand ecosystems in order to maximize the endangered fish\\'s ability to spawn. But some landowners find the amendment intrusive. \"This is the key part,\" said Hawley. \"We are an agricultural state. That would mean farmers and ranchers could find themselves unable to farm their land, unable to develop their land.\" He said it\\'s \"absolutely a killer for small businesses and small farms in our state.\" Hawley is one of 18 Republican AG\\'s suing to overturn the rule. But they are combining forces\\xa0 to file other lawsuits -- challenging the Obama-era Waters of the United States regulatory plan, as well as overtime rules put in place by the Obama Department of Labor and the coal-crimping Clean Power Plan. \"In West Virginia, we suffered acutely because thousands upon thousands of people were put out of work. A number of those people left the state or are pursuing other employment,\" said Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia’s Republican attorney general. Democratic attorneys general, meanwhile, also are mobilizing, trying to preserve Obama-era climate change regulations and, most recently,\\xa0targeting Trump\\'s travel ban. That multi-state attack worked, when Washington states Attorney General Bob Ferguson got a federal judge to temporarily block the policy nationwide. After the ruling, Ferguson noted, \"We are a nation of laws. Those laws apply to everybody in our country. That includes the president of the United States.\" AG\\'s from both parties note filing lawsuits to overturn federal regulations is speedier than internal remedies -- the laborious and slow-moving federal rule-making process. They say the facts of the suits are usually\\xa0 well-known, testimony is usually limited, and judges tend to act quickly. Republican attorneys general note there\\'s an added benefit to them. The lawsuits are helping to restore the concept of federalism, empowering the states and restoring the balance of power against the executive branch.

       " 'A coalition of 24 states is suing the Obama administration in the hopes of defeating what’s been called one of the most “far-reaching energy regulations” in American history: the so-called Clean Power Plan. ADVERTISEMENT “The Clean Power Plan is one of the most far-reaching energy regulations in this nation’s history,” West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, said in a statement announcing the massive legal challenge. “West Virginia is proud to be leading the charge against this Administration’s blatant and unprecedented attack on coal,” Morrisey said. The legal assault comes Friday, the same day the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is publishing the Clean Power Plan (CPP) in the Federal Register — opening it up to legal challenges. Coal companies and other states are expected to sue the EPA as well. States argues CPP is essentially a federal takeover of state resource and energy policy because it forces a shift away from coal regardless of a state’s own plans. CPP is also being challenged because it regulates power plants already covered by another section of the Clean Air Act. “As Attorney General, I have a responsibility to protect the lives of millions of working families, the elderly and the poor, from such illegal and unconscionable Federal Government actions,” Morrisey said. “It’s the people who can afford it least who are going to be affected the most.” This is the second major legal effort against CPP in the last year. A legal challenge by the states and a coal company was   earlier this year because CPP had not yet been finalized. Now that the rule is finished, however, states believe they can mount a more successful legal challenge. CPP aims to cut U.S. power plant emissions 32 percent by 2030 by forcing states to write plans to reduce emissions from the energy sector. The rule will essentially force states to shutter coal-fired power plants and use more natural gas and green energy to get electricity. The EPA argues the rule will not completely eliminate coal use, and that coal will still be an important part of America’s power supply for years to come. But states that rely on coal for the vast majority of their electricity argue the rule will massively increase energy prices and require billions of dollars in new grid investments. West Virginia, for example, is not only the largest coal-producing state east of the Mississippi River, but also   for nearly 96 percent of its electricity generation. To comply with CPP, the state   more coal mines and plants. The other 23 states in the lawsuit are in a similar situation. Many of them rely on coal for most of their electricity needs or have large coal mining sectors. Some have both, like West Virginia. Texas, one of the states challenging the EPA,  \\xa0CPP (combined with EPA’s regional haze rule) could force 4,000 megawatts of coal-fired power capacity to retire which “could pose challenges for maintaining grid reliability.” The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state’s grid regulator,   that “energy costs for customers may increase by up to 16% by 2030 due to the CPP alone” and that’s without taking into account “the associated costs of transmission upgrades, higher natural gas prices caused by increased gas demand, procurement of additional ancillary services, and other costs associated with the retirement or decreased operation of coal-fired capacity.” “Consideration of these factors would result in even higher energy costs for customers,” ERCOT found. While states line up to challenge CPP, environmentalists argue it’s necessary if the U.S. is going to convince the rest of the world it’s serious about tackling global warming. “The Clean Power Plan is on solid legal footing, and will provide huge climate protection and public health benefits for American families and communities, cutting power plant carbon pollution and saving thousands of lives each year,” David Doniger, a lobbyist at the Natural Resources Defense Council,  . “A dirty-energy alliance of coal companies, old-school utilities and their allies will rush to the courthouse with lawsuits stoked with hot rhetoric about its supposedly dire impacts,” Doniger said. “Don’t believe a word of it. The Clean Power Plan will go forward and protect our future.”',\n",

[ ]   : “Republican leaders say the House will vote to block President   from extending relief from deportation to any more immigrants here illegally.

Meanwhile, the Gazette-Mail reported on Monday, they disregarded rules to report suspicious orders for controlled substances in West Virginia to the state Board of Pharmacy. And the board, in turn, failed to enforce the same regulations, even as it approved spotless inspection reviews to small-town pharmacies ordering more pills than could possibly be taken by people who really needed medicine to manage pain. Only after Morrisey\\'s predecessor as attorney general sued wholesalers in 2012 did these companies begin filing the reports. The newspaper said it found more than 7,000 reports in two boxes at the board\\'s office. The regulations don\\'t say what to do with them, so the board didn\\'t investigate, contact wholesalers or pharmacies, or share them with law enforcement, the newspaper reported on Monday. \"It\\'s not been an item that\\'s ever been enforced by the board,\" said David Potters, the pharmacy board\\'s executive director. Drug companies have racked up huge fines for failing to report suspicious orders in other states, but they refused to comment about their reports to West Virginia\\'s board.',\n",
       " 'A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday abruptly halted President Obama\\'s controversial new power plant regulations, dealing a blow to the administration\\'s sweeping plan to address global warming.\\xa0 ADVERTISEMENT In a 5-4 decision, the court halted enforcement of the plan until after legal challenges are resolved. The surprising move is a victory for the coalition of 27 mostly Republican-led states and industry opponents that call the regulations \"an unprecedented power grab.\" By temporarily freezing the rule the high court\\'s order signals that opponents have made a strong argument against the plan. A federal appeals court last month refused to put it on hold. The court\\'s four liberal justices said they would have denied the request. The plan aims to stave off the worst predicted impacts of climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions at existing power plants by about one-third by 2030. \"We disagree with the Supreme Court\\'s decision to stay the Clean Power Plan while litigation proceeds,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement.Earnest said the administration\\'s plan is based on a strong legal and technical foundation, and gives the states time to develop cost-effective plans to reduce emissions. He also said the administration will continue to \"take aggressive steps to make forward progress to reduce carbon emissions.\" Appellate arguments are set to begin June 2. The compliance period starts in 2022, but states must submit their plans to the Environmental Protection Administration by September or seek an extension. Many states opposing the plan depend on economic activity tied to such fossil fuels as coal, oil and gas. They argued that power plants will have to spend billions of dollars to begin complying with a rule that may end up being overturned. Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, whose coal-dependent state is helping lead the legal fight, hailed the court\\'s decision. \"We are thrilled that the Supreme Court realized the rule\\'s immediate impact and froze its implementation, protecting workers and saving countless dollars as our fight against its legality continues,\" Morrisey said.\\xa0 Implementation of the rules is considered essential to the United States meeting emissions-reduction targets in a global climate agreement signed in Paris last month. The Obama administration and environmental groups also say the plan will spur new clean-energy jobs. Environmentalists were stunned by the court\\'s action, which they stressed did not reflect a decision on the relative strength of the Obama administration\\'s case. \"The Clean Power Plan has a firm anchor in our nation\\'s clean air laws and a strong scientific record, and we look forward to presenting our case on the merits in the courts,\" said Vickie Patton, a lawyer for Environmental Defense Fund, which is a party to the case. California Gov. Jerry Brown called the decision an \"arbitrary roadblock\" that \"undermines America\\'s climate leadership.\" To convince the high court to temporarily halt the plan, opponents had to convince the justices that there was a \"fair prospect\" the court might strike down the rule. The court also had to consider whether denying a stay would cause irreparable harm to the states and utility companies affected. The unsigned, one-page order blocks the rules from taking effect while the legal fight plays out in the appeals court and during any further appeal to the Supreme Court, a process that easily could extend into 2017.',\n",

       " 'ADVERTISEMENT Date:Monday, March 2, 2009 Issue: Can a man who was charged for the rape and assault of woman claim his rights are being violated when having failed to challenge or order his own DNA testing at trial seek to do the same after his conviction? Background: William Osborne and another man were convicted of raping and beating a prostitute near the Anchorage Airport. At trial, Osborne\\'s lawyer decided against independently testing the DNA evidence gathered by investigators. Instead, it was determined that the state\\'s broader DNA analysis was more helpful to Osborne\\'s case. Nonetheless, the jury found him guilty and sentenced him to 26 years behind bars. After a maze of most unsuccessful appeals seeking to retest the DNA evidence, Osborne finally found success with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. That court reasoned Osborne has a Constitutional right to force prosecutors to release its evidence to him so he can order more detailed DNA tests. Depending on the results of those tests, a court could order a new trial. The district attorney\\'s office says Osborne had his chance for more advanced DNA evidence at trial and shouldn\\'t get a second crack now.

The Eleventh Circuit ruled that Townsend is able to sue for punitive damages noting a \"willful and persistent failure\" to covere his medical expenses.

Background: Brent Benjamin is the chief justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court, having won his seat in a 2004 statewide election. The man wh is perhaps most responsible for Benjamin\\'s spot on the court is Don Blankenship, CEO of Massey Coal, one of the largest companies in the Mountaineer State. Benjamin spent $3 million in advertisements to help Benjamin\\'s successful campaign. That amount represents 60 percent of all money spent on behalf of the Benjamin campaign. There is no argument that the donations were legal. After the election, Blankenship\\'s company appealed an adverse $50 million judgment to the West Virginia State Supreme Court now presided over by the man he help put there. Justice Benjamin refused to recuse himself from the case, saying there was no conflict of interest and his ability as a jurist would not impact his ability to render a fair decision. Benjamin cast the deciding vote in Massey\\'s favor, setting aside the $50 milion judgment. The losing side in the dispute — a collection of smaller coal companies — contends its Due Process rights were violated by Benjamin\\'s decision to remain in the case. In its brief to the Supreme Court, they argue Benjamin\\'s presence \"created a Constituionally unacceptable probability\" of bias. Lawyers for Massey Coal contend recusal is necessary only when a judge has a \"pecuniary\" interest in the outcome. Something they say is not at issue in this case. They also point out that Justice Benjamin has voted against them at least five other times in cases totaling in excess of $243 million. Earlier this year, Benjamin announced he would no longer take part in Massey Coal cases, saying it would be disrespectful while the matter is before the Supreme Court. This case is seen by some interests as a prime example of why judges shouldn\\'t be elected in the first place. The case also closely parallels the 2008 John Grisham book \"The Appeal.\"',\n",
       " 'MONTCOAL, W.Va. -- A huge underground explosion blamed on methane gas killed 25 coal miners in the worst U.S. mining disaster since 1984, and rescuers on Tuesday began a dangerous and possibly futile attempt to rescue four others still missing. ADVERTISEMENT Crews were bulldozing an access road so they could drill 1,000 feet into the earth to release gases and make it safe to try to find the missing miners. They were feared dead after the Monday afternoon blast at a mine with a history of violations for not properly ventilating highly combustible methane. Rescuers were being held back by poison gases that accumulated near the blast site, about 1.5 miles from the entrance to Massey Energy Co.\\'s sprawling Upper Big Branch mine. They had to create an access road above it before they could begin drilling four shafts to release methane and carbon monoxide. Gov.   said at a news briefing Tuesday that it could be Wednesday night before the first hole is drilled. \"It\\'s a slow process,\" Manchin said. \"It\\'s just going to be a slow process.\" It had already been a long day for grieving relatives, some angry because they found out their loved ones were among the dead from government officials or a company Web site, not from Massey Energy executives. \"They\\'re supposed to be a big company,\" said Michelle McKinney, who found out from a local official at a nearby school that her 62-year-old father, Benny R. Willingham, died in the blast. \"These guys, they took a chance every day to work and make them big. And they couldn\\'t even call us.\" McKinney said her husband is a miner too and her 16-year-old son doesn\\'t want him to go back to work. Willingham, who had mined for 30 years, the last 17 with Massey, was just five weeks from retiring and planned to take his wife on a cruise to the Virgin Islands next month. U.S. Rep. Nick Rayhall, D-W.Va., said at a press briefing Wednesday that Massey should have been in better contact with families. Three members of the same family were among the dead. Diana Davis said her husband, Timmy Davis, 51, died in the explosion along with his nephews, Josh Napper, 27, and Cory Davis, 20. The elder Davis\\' son, Timmy Davis Jr., said his brother, Cody Davis, and an uncle, Tommy Davis, were also at the mine at the time and survived the blast. He said his brother was taking it particularly hard because he and their father were best friends. Timmy Davis Jr. described his dad as passionate about the outdoors and the mines. \"He loved to work underground,\" the younger Davis said. \"He loved that place.\" President   offered his condolences at an Easter prayer breakfast in Washington on Tuesday and said the federal government is ready to assist with whatever the state needs. He also asked the audience to pray for those lost in what he called a tragic accident. Kevin Stricklin, an administrator for the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, said the situation looked grim for the missing miners. \"All we have left is hope, and we\\'re going to continue to do what we can,\" he said. Officials hoped the four miners still unaccounted for were able to reach airtight chambers stocked with food, water and enough oxygen for them to live for four days, but rescue teams checked one of two such chambers nearby and it was empty. The buildup of gases prevented teams from reaching other chambers, officials said. A total of 31 miners were in the area during a shift change when the explosion rocked the mine, about 30 miles south of Charleston. \"Before you knew it, it was just like your ears stopped up, you couldn\\'t hear and the next thing you know, it\\'s just like you\\'re just right in the middle of a tornado,\" miner  , who heard the explosion but was able to escape, told ABC\\'s \" .\" Some of those killed may have died in the blast and others when they breathed in the gas-filled air, Stricklin said. Eleven bodies had been recovered and identified, but the other 14 have not. Names weren\\'t released publicly. He said investigators still don\\'t know what ignited the blast, but methane likely played a part. The death toll is the highest in a U.S. mine since 1984, when 27 died in a fire at Emery Mining Corp.\\'s mine in Orangeville, Utah. If the four missing bring the total to 29, it would be the most killed in a U.S. mine since a 1970 explosion killed 38 at Finley Coal Co., in Hyden, Ky. \"There\\'s always danger. There\\'s so many ways you can get hurt, or your life taken,\" said  , a miner and pastor of New Life Assembly, a church near the southern West Virginia mine. \"It\\'s not something you dread every day, but there\\'s always that danger. But for this area, it\\'s the only way you\\'re going to make a living.\" Though the situation looked bleak, Manchin said miracles can happen and pointed to the 2006 Sago Mine explosion that killed 12. Crews found miner Randal McCloy Jr. alive after he was trapped for more than 40 hours in an atmosphere poisoned with carbon monoxide. In Monday\\'s blast, nine miners were leaving on a vehicle that takes them in and out of the mine\\'s long shaft when a crew ahead of them felt a blast of air and went back to investigate, Stricklin said. They found seven workers dead. Others were hurt or missing about a mile and a half inside the mine, though there was some confusion over how many. Others made it out. In a statement early Tuesday, Massey Chairman and CEO Don Blankenship offered his condolences to the families of the dead. Massey Energy, a publicly traded company based in Richmond, Va., has 2.2 billion tons of coal reserves in southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, southwest Virginia and Tennessee. It ranks among the nation\\'s top five coal producers and is among the industry\\'s most profitable. It has a spotty safety record. In the past year, federal inspectors fined the company more than $382,000 for repeated serious violations involving its ventilation plan and equipment at Upper Big Branch. Methane is one of the great dangers of coal mining, and federal records say the Eagle coal seam releases up to 2 million cubic feet of methane gas into the Upper Big Branch mine every 24 hours, which is a large amount, said Dennis O\\'Dell, health and safety director for the United Mine Workers labor union. In mines, giant fans are used to keep the colorless, odorless gas concentrations below certain levels. If concentrations are allowed to build up, the gas can explode with a spark roughly similar to the static charge created by walking across a carpet in winter, as at the Sago mine, also in West Virginia. Since then, federal and state regulators have required mine operators to store extra oxygen supplies. Upper Big Branch uses containers that can generate about an hour of breathable air, and all miners carry a container on their belts besides the stockpiles inside the mine. Upper Big Branch has had three other fatalities in the last dozen years. Upper Big Branch has 19 openings and roughly 7-foot ceilings. Inside, it\\'s crisscrossed with railroad tracks used for hauling people and equipment. It is located in a mine-laced swath of Raleigh and Boone counties that is the heart of West Virginia\\'s coal country. The seam produced 1.2 million tons of coal in 2009, according to the mine safety agency, and has about 200 employees.',\n",
       " 'MONTCOAL, W.Va. -- Crews were drilling early Wednesday to ventilate toxic gas from a West Virginia coal mine shattered by a deadly explosion, trying to make a section of it safe enough for rescuers to search for four missing miners as hope for their survival grew dim. ADVERTISEMENT Two days after the blast killed 25 and left two hospitalized, the buildup of methane gas and carbon monoxide was too dangerous for anyone to enter and look for the last of the missing or to recover the bodies of 18 known dead. Seven bodies were brought out after Monday afternoon\\'s blast rocked the Upper Big Branch Mine, site of the worst underground disaster in the U.S. in more than a quarter-century. Once the mine is ventilated, teams would need four or five hours to reach the area where officials believe the miners are about 1,000 feet beneath the surface, said Chris Adkins, chief operating officer for Massey Energy Co., which owns the mine. The long section is about 20 feet wide with barely enough room to stand, a safety official said. Searchers would have to navigate in the darkness around debris from structures shattered by the explosion and around sections of track that were \"wrapped like a pretzel,\" said Kevin Stricklin, an administrator from the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. \"There\\'s so much dirt and dust and everything is so dark that it\\'s very easy, as hard as it may seem to any of us outside in this room, to walk by a body,\" Stricklin said. Crews also will perform a seismic test Wednesday, transmitting a sound underground to alert any survivors that rescuers are coming for them. The miners are supposed to tap on the roof to signal they heard the sound -- however, officials said it\\'s a long shot because they are so deep inside the mountain. Gov.   said it could be midday before much progress is made on the four ventilation shafts. \"I don\\'t want to give anybody any false hope, but by golly, if I\\'m on that side of the table, and that\\'s my father or my brother or my uncle or my cousins, I\\'m going to have hope,\" he said Tuesday. The missing miners might have been able to reach airtight chambers stocked with food, water and enough oxygen for four days. But rescue teams checked one of two chambers nearby and found it empty. Unsafe conditions prevented them from reaching the second. Massey Energy Co. was fined more than $382,000 in the past year for repeated serious violations involving its ventilation plan and equipment. The company\\'s chief executive said the mine was not unsafe, but federal regulators planned to review its violations, many of which involved venting methane gas. If the odorless, colorless gas is not kept at safe levels, a small spark can ignite it. In the area about 30 miles south of Charleston where coal is king, people anxiously awaited word on the missing. Larry Asbury\\'s son is on a mine rescue team. Asbury joined about 50 mourners who packed the creaky pews of the modest St. Joseph   a few miles from the disaster to honor the victims and pray that the missing turn up safe. \"The coal community is coming together and praying for miners and their families,\" he said. \"It\\'s just so important to show the community this kind of support.\" Diana Davis said her husband, Timmy Davis, 51, died in the explosion along with his nephews, Josh Napper, 27, and Cory Davis, 20. The elder Davis\\' son, Timmy Davis Jr., described his father as passionate about the outdoors and the mines. \"He loved to work underground,\" the younger Davis said. Two other family members survived, he said. During pauses at Tuesday\\'s service at St. Joseph\\'s, some leaned over and consoled each other. \"It\\'s such a terrible time for West Virginia, but it\\'s so important to ask for God\\'s help,\" said Bishop Michael J. Bransfield. At the time of the explosion, 61 miners were in the mine. Nine were leaving on a vehicle that takes them in and out of the shaft when a crew ahead of them felt a blast of air and went back to investigate, said MSHA administrator Stricklin. \"I don\\'t know that we know what happened,\" the chief executive of Massey Energy, Don Blankenship, told The Associated Press. He said the chances of miners making it out of the violent explosion alive were dim, and \"I think it dims every day.\" Some may have been killed by the blast and others when they inhaled the toxic gases, Stricklin said. Some grieving relatives were angry because they learned their loved ones were among the dead from government officials, not from Massey executives. Michelle McKinney found out from a local official that her 61-year-old father, Benny R. Willingham, was among the dead. He was due to retire in five weeks after 30 years of mining. \"These guys, they took a chance every day to work\" to make the mining company grow, she said. And company officials \"couldn\\'t even call us.\" Manchin said a Massey official apologized to family members Tuesday for not being notified of the deaths. Blankenship said he was in the room when relatives were notified of the full extent of the tragedy, but the scene was so emotional that he did not interact with them. He left others in the company and safety officials to notify the families, he said. The death toll was the highest in a U.S. mine since 1984, when 27 people died in a fire at Emery Mining Corp.\\'s mine in Orangeville, Utah. If the four missing bring the total to 29, it would be the most to die in a U.S. coal mine since a 1970 explosion killed 38 at Finley Coal Co. in Hyden, Ky.

Massey Energy, a publicly traded company based in Richmond, Va., ranks among the nation\\'s top five coal producers and is among the industry\\'s most profitable. Blankenship said the mine was \"not thought to be unsafe by the agencies or the company.\" \"I think that what they (the Mine Safety and Health Administration) said is, \\'You know, there\\'s been a lot of debate about the ventilation.\\' At the times the mine operates and men are in the mine, it complies with whatever the federal and state agencies have agreed.\" Blankenship said the mine likely would be closed for months.',\n",
       " 'CHARLESTON, West Virginia \\xa0-- The Massey Energy coal mine where 25 people died in an explosion was cited for violating two federal safety rules on the day of the blast. ADVERTISEMENT Mine Safety and Health Administration records show the citations were issued Monday. The records do not specifically say whether they were issued before the explosion. Neither federal mine safety officials nor Massey immediately responded to requests for comment Wednesday. Records show one of the violations involved inadequate maps of escape routes from the Upper Big Branch mine. Underground coal mines are required to have maps detailing escape routes, oxygen caches, and refuge chambers. The other involved an improper splice of electrical cable on a piece of equipment. The mine has been cited for 600 violations in less than a year and a half, some of them for not properly ventilating methane -- the highly combustible gas suspected in the blast. The disaster at the Upper Big Branch mine has focused attention on the business and safety practices of the owner, Massey Energy, a powerful and politically connected company in Appalachia known for producing big profits, as well as big piles of safety and environmental violations and big damage awards for grieving widows. \"There are mines in this country who have operated safely for 20 years,\" said J. Davitt McAteer, head of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration in the Clinton administration. \"There are mines who take precautions ahead of time. There are mines who spend the money and manpower to do it.\" He added: \"Those mines haven\\'t been blown up.\" Four other miners were missing and feared dead underground in Monday\\'s blast, believed to have been caused by a buildup of methane, a naturally occurring gas that is odorless and colorless. Last year alone, MSHA cited Upper Big Branch for 495 violations and proposed $911,802 in fines. Production more than tripled during that period, according to federal records. So far this year, the agency has found 105 violations at the mine. Upper Big Branch is one of Massey\\'s biggest underground mines, with more than 200 employees, and it is not uncommon for big coal mines to amass hundreds of violations a year -- and to contest many of them, as Massey does. But most big mines don\\'t have as many serious infractions as Upper Big Branch, industry experts said. At least 50 citations charge the company with \"unwarrantable failure\" to comply with safety standards such as following an approved ventilation plan, controlling combustible materials or designating escape routes. \"I\\'ve never seen that many for one mine in a year,\" said Ellen Smith, editor of Mine Safety & Health News. \"If you look at other mines that are the same size or bigger, they do not have the sheer number of `unwarrantable\\' citations that this mine has.\" Massey has had problems elsewhere, too. In 2006, two miners were killed in a fire at Massey\\'s Aracoma Alma No. 1 mine. Massey settled a wrongful death lawsuit for an undisclosed sum, and its subsidiary Aracoma Coal Co. paid $4.2 million in civil and criminal penalties. Testimony showed Massey CEO Don Blankenship suggested firing two supervisors for raising concerns about conveyer belt problems just before the belt caught fire. \"Massey has a history of emphasizing production,\" said Pittsburgh lawyer Bruce Stanley, who represented the miners\\' widows. \"I\\'m concerned that they may not have learned the lessons of Aracoma.\" In an interview less than 24 hours after the disaster at Upper Big Branch, Blankenship insisted the mine is no more dangerous than others of comparable size, and he defended the company\\'s track record in a perilous business. \"It\\'s natural that the enemies of coal would view Massey as the primary enemy,\" he said. He pointed out Massey\\'s many innovations, such as installing steps in place of ladders and putting protective cages on underground vehicles even though the government doesn\\'t require them. \"I think that I\\'ve proven that we run safer coal mines -- you know, most of the time -- and accidents sometimes happen. We\\'ve got to figure out what happened here,\" he said. Kevin Stricklin, an MSHA administrator, said that the number of citations at the mine appeared high, and that he was concerned about the more serious violations. \"It means the operator was aware of some of these conditions,\" he said. Massey is contesting 36 percent of all violations at Upper Big Branch since 2007, The Associated Press found. Overall, U.S. mine operators contest 27 percent. Challenging violations can enable a mine owner to stave off the heavier punishment that the government can impose on companies that have been deemed repeat offenders. Massey became a political and industrial powerhouse under the guidance of Blankenship, who rose from poverty to become one of corporate America\\'s highest-paid and least apologetic executives, a guy who proudly displays in his office a TV set with a bullet hole from a striking union miner\\'s rifle. He freely spent millions of dollars from his personal fortune to help install a West Virginia   justice, a maneuver that led to an important conflict-of-interest ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, and on a failed bid to elect a Republican majority in the state Legislature. Under Blankenship, Massey clawed to the top of the Appalachian coal industry, shrewdly buying up coal deposits to amass more than 2 billion tons of reserves. It is a major economic force regionally, with more than 6,000 high-paid miners in some of the poorest counties in America. Operating nonunion mines across southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southwestern Virginia, Massey more than doubled its profit to $104.4 million in 2009 from the year before, despite slumping demand for coal amid the recession. The company expects to be shipping 2 million tons of coal a year to   by next year. Massey has managed to push the United Mine Workers union out of all of its operations except for a single processing plant. Blankenship\\'s hard-driving approach was illustrated in a 2005 memo in which he told mine workers that if their bosses ask them to build roof supports or perform similar tasks, \"ignore them and run coal.\" \"This memo is necessary only because we seem not to understand that the coal pays the bills,\" he wrote. Few workers are willing to openly criticize Massey because of its powerful hold on people\\'s livelihoods in Appalachia. But Terry Holstein, who worked at Upper Big Branch, said it took him 10 years to decide he didn\\'t like the way Massey ran the mine. He left in 2006. \"It was like they wanted production more than they wanted safety, myself, you know what I mean?\" he said. \"They speak safety first, but production\\'s really first for them.\"',\n",
       " 'MONTCOAL, W.Va. -- Crews on Saturday began the bleak task of carrying bodies out of a coal mine shattered by an explosion that left 29 men dead, only hours after families\\' hopes were crushed when they found out none of the workers survived. ADVERTISEMENT It had been an excruciating week for friends holding onto faint hopes that their missing miners were somehow alive. Seven bodies had already been removed soon after the blast Monday at Massey Energy Co.\\'s Upper Big Branch mine, the worst U.S. coal mining disaster since a 1970 explosion killed 38 in Hyden, Ky. Federal mine safety officials said crews were working to get the bodies out but did not know how long that would take. Meanwhile, President   is awaiting a report on the mine, which has recorded a long list of safety violations, and Congress is planning hearings. \"All Americans deserve to work in a place that is safe, and we must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that all our miners are as safe as possible so that a disaster like this doesn\\'t happen again,\" Obama said. Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration spokeswoman Amy Louviere said officials would arrive Monday to begin investigating the disaster. On Saturday, the mood among many people in this swath of coal country was somber. \"It takes something like this to really get your attention, but I think about it everyday,\" said James Lipford, 38, who said he has been a miner for 10 years. The discovery of the final four bodies ended days of futile searches by rescue crews that repeatedly battled a volatile mix of poisonous gases and thick smoke that turned them back on three previous attempts. The massive blast also left the inside of the mine a mess of twisted tracks, boulders and debris. \"We did not receive the miracle that we prayed for,\" Gov.   told reporters after meeting with relatives to deliver the news. \"So this journey has ended and now the healing will start.\" The explosion erupted without warning. \"They didn\\'t know what hit them,\" said Patty Ann Manios, a city councilwoman from nearby Whitesville. While watching the official announcement on TV, she took off her glasses and started to weep. \"Oh God. Oh God.\" Initially, 25 men were known to have perished and two men survived. That left four unaccounted for, resulting in an agonizing week for relatives and officials who hoped the miners had somehow managed to find refuge chambers stocked with food, water and oxygen. But none of the mine\\'s refuge chambers had been deployed. \"The rescue workers told us they\\'re sure no one suffered,\" Manchin said. Twenty-eight of the dead were Massey employees, and one was a contract worker, a company spokesman said. A complete list of victims was not released, though several were known through obituaries and information families released. Even as rescuers were making their final trip into the mine, the close-knit community was beginning to mourn the dead. More than 300 people packed the Mullens Pentecostal Holiness Church for the funeral of Benny Willingham, a 61-year-old miner who was five weeks from retiring when he died. More services were planned Saturday. \"He wasn\\'t the biggest man in town,\" said the Rev. Gary Pollard. \"But if you could see the size of this man\\'s heart, you\\'d see a giant.\" The conditions were so rough after the blast that rescuers only late Friday realized that they had walked past the bodies of the four missing miners on the first day without seeing, a federal mine safety official said. \"There was so much smoke and the conditions were so dire with dust in the air that they apparently bypassed the bodies that were on the ground,\" said Kevin Stricklin, coal administrator for the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. Once the bodies are recovered, MSHA and West Virginia regulators plan a joint investigation that could take up to a year, Stricklin said. \"No stone will be left unturned and we\\'ll find out the cause of this explosion,\" Stricklin said. \"Quite frankly, the only good thing that can come out of this is to educate everyone, put regulations in place to make sure that this never happens again.\" \"Amen brother!\" retired miner Willam \"Hot Rod\" White yelled as officials vowed a thorough investigation. White was so infuriated watching the news conference come to an end that he left the poker room, hopped in his car and sped away. He did not return, leaving an unopened beer he bought from the gas station next door. Officials have not said what caused the blast, but they believe high levels of methane gas may have played a role. The U.S. House and Senate plan to hold hearings, though a date has not been set. Sen.  , D-W.Va., said lawmakers will scrutinize Massey\\'s practices. In the days since the explosion, details have emerged about an extensive list of safety violations at the mine. Mine owner Massey Energy Co. has been repeatedly cited and fined for problems with the system that vents methane and for allowing combustible dust to build up. The company also said it will conduct its own probe into the blast. CEO Don Blankenship, who was with the families when they learned the miners were dead, has strongly defended the company\\'s record and disputed accusations from miners that he puts coal profits ahead of safety. Federal regulators issued evacuation orders for all or parts of the mine more than 60 times since the start of 2009, according to inspection records. In 2007, the mine met criteria to be declared by the Mine Safety and Health Administration as a pattern violator, which would have allowed for stricter oversight, including the potential shutdown of the mine. But Massey was able to reduce the number of the most serious violations and avoid it. Pam Napper, whose 25-year-old son Josh died, said he had been sent home early the Friday before the explosion because of concerns about ventilation in the mine. Before that, apparently over Easter weekend, he wrote a letter to his mother, his fiancee and his 19-month-old daughter, telling them that he would be looking down from heaven if anything happened to him. \"I just knew that Josh in his heart knew that something was going to happen,\" Pam Napper said. Donna Ward, whose husband works at a different mine, was still crying minutes after the press conference was over. \"I was hoping for four miracles,\" she said.',\n",
       " 'Hazard, Kentucky is one of those small coal-mining towns with one main road snaking through the hollow. Both sides of the road are lined with a handful of retail stores and restaurants. The windows on about half of those stores are now covered with newspaper. The signs out front say, “closed.”  ADVERTISEMENT That’s what happens in a one-industry town when the president turns against that industry. Carla Hall at tiny Feltner’s Barbershop, right on the main road, knows that too well. \"My business went down tremendously,” she said.  Like Carla, everyone in town, from the insurance salesman to the waitress at the coffee shop, is ultimately connected to money that comes out of the mine.  “When they start getting laid off, they stretch out the haircuts,” she said.  However, there is a new sense of optimism in coal country and that is linked to a new president who, from the campaign trail, frequently bellowed: “We are going to put our miners back to work.” “I love mining coal,” Carlos Sturdill said 250 feet underground in the E4-1 mine in Hazard. That mine shut down in the Obama years. There are many factors that allowed the mine to re-open and people like Sturdill to get back to work.  For starters, the entire economy has seen a bump. That has created a demand for steel. The high-quality coal that comes out of Appalachia is well suited for making steel. “I’m glad to be working. I’m thankful I’ve got a job again,” Sturdill said. Then you have President Trump who started rolling back regulations early in his time on the job. One of Trump’s early executive orders was to roll back the Stream Protection Rule. The SPR was created in the 11th hour of the Obama presidency and it would have placed a burden on coal companies to test streams before during and after mining. Trump followed up by undoing the 2015 Waters of the US rule, which broadened the definition of a body of water.  According to West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the rule “allowed the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers to assert Federal authority over an untold number of small bodies of water, including roadside ditches, short-lived streams and any other area where water may flow every 100 years.”  The industry is hopeful Trump will also repeal the Clean Power Plan and the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards act, which many argue put a heavy burden on coal by design.  \"Obviously, we’re more optimistic,” said J. Mark Campbell, President of the Cambrian Coal Group. “We’re looking for new projects.” That does not mean hard times are over for those people dependent on a coal mining paycheck. During the Obama administration, figures obtained by Fox News show that 36,800 coal miners lost their jobs. Last September, the number of people mining coal hit the lowest point since 1985.  Since Trump took office, 300 miners have been re-hired. Ninety of the new hires are at the E4-1 mine in Hazard. But that was after the mine was hit by a series of layoffs since 2012 that left 460 workers out of a job. “Maybe it’s a little C comeback at this point,” said Chris Hamilton Senior VP of the West Virginia Coal Association. No one expects coal jobs to come back to their heyday. Some of the causes can be pinned on former President Obama.  Under pressure to get away from coal, some power plants shut down. Some were retrofitted to burn natural gas. Now that officials spent the money, they won’t go back -- especially because hydraulic fracturing makes natural gas available and cheap. \"So, a lot of that chunk of the market has been taken away,” said Dr. Anthony Szwilski of West Virginia’s Marshall University. “Even though coal is coming back and there will be employment in the future, they are unlikely to go back to where it was 10-15 years ago.” Technology has also advanced. The reality is this: you can get more coal out of the ground now using fewer people.  \"It will never be back like it was,” Campbell said. Even Sturgill, although happy to be back underground doing the job he loves, knows coal mining is a way of life that has a limited future.  \"I don’t have a son, but I wouldn’t tell him to mine,” he says as the beam from his headlamp follows his eyes and dips to the floor of the mine.

       " 'Attorneys general across the country are fighting back against new Obama administration guidelines on businesses using criminal background checks for job applicants and two federal lawsuits that followed, calling both “a quintessential example of gross federal overreach.” ADVERTISEMENT The nine attorneys general sent the letter Wednesday to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which in April 2012 voted in favor of the new guidelines that warn such checks can discriminate against African-Americans because they being are arrested at a disproportionate rate compared to the rest of the U.S. population. Fifteen months after issuing the guidelines -- which included the recommendation that businesses eliminate such policies -- the commission filed lawsuits against discount retailer Dollar General and a BMW facility in South Carolina for alleged civil rights violations. “We believe that these lawsuits and your application of the law, as articulated through your enforcement guidance, are misguided and a quintessential example of gross federal overreach,” the attorneys general wrote in a nine-page letter to EEOC Chairman Jacqueline Berrien and the agency’s four commissioners. The June 11 suits allege Dollar General violated the civil rights of two applicants. In the one case, the applicant alleged she was denied employment even though a felony conviction was incorrectly attributed to her. In the BMW case, the EEOC alleges that when the company required contract employees at the South Carolina plant to reapply for their jobs in 2008 a disproportionate percentage of those terminated were black, including some who had already worked for company contractors. The suit also alleges BMW’s policy doesn\\'t consider the nature of the crimes or how long ago they were committed. All of the claimants are black, and both cases are filed in federal court, according to the EEOC.\\xa0 The commission said upon updating the policy that civil rights laws already prohibit different treatment for job applicants with different ethnic backgrounds but identical criminal histories. However, the updates were issued out of concern that employers might disproportionately exclude minorities from getting hired because more African Americans and Hispanics are getting arrested and going to prison, according to the guideline report. While the percentage of working-age Americans with a criminal record has increased significantly over the past 20 years, African Americans and Hispanics are arrested two to three times as much compared with the rest of the U.S. population, according to a commission report at the time of the vote. Still, the suits have re-ignited concerns over such issues as potential federal overreach, the overlap of state and federal law and companies losing their rights to protect customers, workers and assets while trying to adhere to fair hiring practices. Kevin Connell, chairman of the Florida-based employment and tenant screening company AccuScreen.com, told FoxNews.com on Saturday he doesn’t expect the EEOC to reverse course, but the letter is a step in the right direction. “I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said. “My concern is the EEOC is trying to create a protected classes, which is former criminals. Anybody with some intelligence can see that.” The letter also asks the EEOC to reconsider the lawsuits and the changes driving the suits. And it argues the guideline suggesting businesses take a more “individual assessment” of potential employees will add significant costs and become a “burden” to companies. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said he has a special concern with the EEOC’s “aggressive overreach” – considering Dollar General in one of the state’s largest private employers. The other eight attorneys general are from Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina and Utah. BMW spokesman Kenn Sparks said last month the company cannot comment on the specifics of pending litigation. “However, BMW believes that it has complied with the letter and spirit of the law and will defend itself against the EEOC’s allegations of race discrimination,” he told FoxNews.com. \\xa0\\xa0 Dollar General responded to the suit by reportedly saying it prohibits discriminatory hiring in its employment practices but its criminal background checks are \"structured to foster a safe and healthy environment for its employees, its customers, and to protect its assets in a lawful, reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner.\"',\n",
       " 'The federal government said Friday it will open an investigation into a West Virginia chemical spill that shut down much of the state\\'s capital and put 300,000 residents at risk. ADVERTISEMENT Schools and restaurants closed, grocery stores sold out of bottled water, and state legislators who had just started their session canceled the day\\'s business after a chemical spill in the Elk River in Charleston, even as the extent of the danger remained unclear. The federal government joined the state early Friday in declaring a disaster and announced an investigation into the spill, while the West Virginia National Guard planned to distribute bottled drinking water to emergency services agencies in the nine affected counties. Shortly after the Thursday spill from Freedom Industries , a licorice-like smell enveloped parts of the city, and Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin issued an order to customers of West Virginia American Water: Do not drink, bathe, cook or wash clothes with tap water. Freedom Industries says it doesn\\'t know how much of a chemical spilled from its plant in Charleston into the Elk Rive, but that it\\'s working to contain the leak and prevent further contamination. Joe Leonoro, who works at Leonoro’s Spaghetti House, told FoxNews.com he first noticed the smell at 6 p.m. Thursday night, right after he watched a news report on the development. \"I knew what I was smelling, but I didn\\'t think it would hurt the community like this,\" he said. Leonoro said his Charleston restaurant will lose \"a substantial\" amount of money while closed today, but he said his small business joins many others. \"Laundromats, hair dressers, restaurants…you don\\'t realize how many people are impacted,\" he said. The chemical, a foaming agent used in the coal preparation process, leaked from a tank at Freedom Industries and overran a containment area.\\xa0 Officials say the orders were issued as a precaution, as they were still not sure exactly what hazard the spill posed to residents.\\xa0 The tank that leaked holds at least 40,000 gallons, said Tom Aluise, a state Department of Environmental Protection spokesman. \"We\\'re confident that no more than 5,000 gallons escaped,\" he said. \"A certain amount of that got into the river. Some of that was contained.\" Agency officials do not know how long the chemical had been leaking, Aluise said in a telephone interview. There was a breach in a concrete wall that served as a containment area to prevent spills from leaving the storage site, he said. \"Our understanding is it\\'s not an especially toxic material. It\\'s not dangerous necessarily to be around,\" he said. According to a fact sheet from Fisher Scientific, the chemical is harmful if swallowed -- and could be so if inhaled -- and causes eye and skin irritation. Freedom Industries will be responsible for cleanup at the site, Aluise said. \"I don\\'t know if the water is not safe,\" water company president Jeff McIntyre said. \"Until we get out and flush the actual system and do more testing, we can\\'t say how long this (advisory) will last at this time.\" McIntyre said the chemical isn\\'t lethal in its strongest form. Kanawha County emergency officials said the chemical is called 4-methylcyclohexane methanol. The emergency declaration involves customers in all or parts of the counties of Kanawha, Boone, Cabell, Clay, Jackson, Lincoln, Logan, Putnam and Roane. State Department of Education spokeswoman Liza Cordeiro said schools in at least five of the counties will be closed. The smell from the spill -- similar to licorice or cough syrup -- was especially strong at the Charleston Marriott hotel a few blocks from the Elk River, which flows into the Kanawha River in downtown Charleston. The Marriott shut off all water to rooms, and then turned it back on so guests could flush toilets. Each guest was given two 16.9-ounce bottles of spring water upon returning to the hotel. About 50 miles away in the unaffected city of Huntington, a hotel offered free showers for those affected. Even as the National Guard made plans to mobilize at an air base at Charleston\\'s Yeager Airport, many people -- told to use water only for flushing toilets -- weren\\'t waiting for outside help. For instance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency was planning to deliver more than a million liters of water from nearby Maryland, but the first shipments were not expected to arrive until Friday night. Once word got out about the governor\\'s declaration Thursday, customers stripped store shelves in many areas of items such as bottled water, paper cups and bowls. As many as 50 customers had lined up to buy water at a convenience store near the state Capitol in Charleston. \"It was chaos, that\\'s what it was,\" cashier Danny Cardwell said. State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey warned residents about price gouging on water, ice and other items, calling it \"just plain wrong\" to inflate prices and encouraging those who\\'ve seen such practices to report them to his office\\'s consumer protection division. Although the governor noted that the water advisory extended to restaurants, hospitals, nursing homes and other establishments that use tap water, state public safety spokesman Lawrence Messina said Friday that he wasn\\'t aware of any hospitals closing and that medical centers \"seemed to have adequate water supply, at least for the short term.\" At the Little India restaurant in Charleston, about 12 customers were asked to leave when bar manager Bill LaCourse learned about the shutdown notice. Karlee Bolen, 16, of Charleston, said her family, including her parents, two sisters and brother, were considering the possibility of heading to her grandmother\\'s home in Braxton County, where tap water was unaffected, an hour to the northeast. \"I kind of want to shower and brush my teeth,\" she said.',\n",

Under the so-called final rule EPA issued informally on Aug. 3 for what the agency calls the Clean Power Plan (CPP), all U.S. states have until Sept. 6, 2016, to submit preliminary strategies on cutting carbon emissions from their electrical power systems by 32 percent on average below 2005 levels—essentially mandating a massive conversion from coal-fired power generation to natural gas and renewable energy sources. If EPA approves the proposals, the states would then get two more years to complete planning for the sweeping changes. If states fail to make the initial submission, EPA says it will offer up its own versions of what they will have to do. By starting the deadline clock before publication in the  —which the lawsuit claims could take three to four months beyond Aug. 3 - the states charge that EPA at a minimum is forcing them to restructure priorities and prematurely throw thousands of hours of planning time at the rule before they can legally contest the plan and its 2018 final deadline. For its part, EPA says that   publication is irrelevant, and that the “promulgation” of the rule on Aug. 3 - when EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy signed the rule and posted it on the EPA website - is what matters. In a hint at another reason for EPA’s hurry-up schedule, an EPA statement says the plan “shows the world that the United States is committed to leading global efforts to address climate change”—a tacit reference to a United Nations-backed global climate change summit planned for Paris in December, where supporters hope to endorse a new legally binding treaty on greenhouse gas limits. The dissenting states - they range from Florida and Louisiana to Michigan, Ohio and Indiana - have already condemned the huge plan as an unprecedented extension of EPA authority under a little-used section of the Clean Air Act, and an illegal intrusion on their own power to regulate electrical generation systems. Almost all of them \\xa0add that the \\xa0mammoth scale of the imposed changes go much further than a proposed version of the rule published a year ago, and require five to 10 years to plan adequately and safely. In many cases, they add, they simply do not have the legal authority to comply with the terms of the rule as they unofficially know it, without getting additional legislative authority that could itself take years to obtain. Some of them point out they are already being greatly overstretched in struggling to comply with a blizzard of other EPA regulations governing ozone, methane, and other substances that are coming at them all more or less simultaneously. The Appeals Court lawsuit, however, claims EPA is additionally cheating with its initial Sept. 26 deadline, which it says is a major departure from regular practice. The huge and complex rule—the text runs to 1,560 pages, with many attendant technical documents—has not yet appeared in the  , the normal starting point for agency deadlines. \\xa0 Court rulings have established that   publication is the point when legal challenges to the rule itself can be mounted. EPA told Fox News the Clean Air Act provides that agency is “moving expeditiously to have the final rule published in the  ,” and “contrary to Rehearing Petitioners’ baseless speculations of delay” it will be published “in the normal course” – without defining any time line. An EPA spokesperson said current regulations “governing state plans under this part of the Act, which have been in place since the 1970s, provide states nine months to submit final state plans” and that the time periods allotted in the CPP were deliberately made longer. But those regulations refer to responses to changes under the section of the Clean Air Act that were never on the massive scale of the new rule. \\xa0“If we were to wait on the EPA to get this rule published, it could be well into 2016 before the States complete arguments and receive a ruling on a request to stay this rule,” argued Patrick Morrisey, Attorney General of West Virginia, which is serving as lead plaintiff in the deadline lawsuit. “By that time, many states will already be in the middle of drafting their compliance plans ahead of the September 2016 deadline. We want to ensure that no more taxpayer money or resources are wastefully spent in an attempt to comply with this unlawful rule that we believe will ultimately be thrown out in court.” Dan Goldblatt, a spokesman for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, said the carbon emissions goal his state faces by 2030 under the final rule “is nearly twice as stringent” as it was under the proposed version. Moreover, the amount of energy Indiana must generate from renewable sources under the new rule is about 20.5 per cent of the total — “equivalent to the current total generation capacity of nearly one-third of the states in the country.” The need for state lawmakers’ approval of the huge changes makes the process even more convoluted, he noted. “Due to the timing of the [EPA] rule, we will not be able to take anything to our legislature until the 2017 session.\\xa0 This means that we must commit to a plan in 2016 for which we will not have legislative approval at that time.” “We feel so strongly that EPA has clearly overstepped its legal authority that once courts consider the rule, we maybe would not have to implement it to begin with,” Craig Butler, head of Ohio’s state Environmental Protection Agency, told Fox News. But as matters stand, his agency is still in the process of a 30-day crash marathon--along with the state\\xa0 public utilities commission, power generation operators, electrical grid operators and other “stakeholders”—to understand what the CPP actually says. As part of the initial lawsuit filing, the protesting states offer a litany of complaints about the harm the fuzzy deadline is forcing on them to confront the hugely complex and interlocking plan—not only in terms of staffing demands, but in terms of over-hurried examination of the risks and multibillion-dollar costs involved in power systems that are already strained by new clean-air requirements. According to a declaration from Kansas air quality authorities, for example, the state has made $3 billion in recent investments in pollution emission reduction equipment that will be wasted, along with six coal-fired generating plants, in any effort to meet the new rule.\\xa0 Ohio’s Butler observes that “we have already seen over 6,000 megawatts of power shut off” due to a recent EPA rule governing mercury emissions from coal-fired plants, and there is a “sheer problem with infrastructure” to meet the new rule. Translation: the gas pipelines, and the gas, aren’t necessarily in the right place to match the new tasks. “It is not as easy to replace coal with natural gas as it is to say it,” he told Fox News—especially without adequate time to study how to go about the challenge. According to a submission by David Bracht, head of the Nebraska Energy Office—the former head of a legal firm’s renewable energy group and private-sector advisor on major wind and ethanol projects—the changes that states must propose “over the next calendar year will be irreversible and will impact the electric grid for decades.” In Nebraska’s case, he declared, they would also disrupt an 80-year tradition of local public control of utilities and likely give unprecedented control instead to multi-state regional power authorities, which in turn would require “legislative and constitutional changes on the state level that may permanently alter the daily operation of utilities.” In addition, he told Fox News by telephone, “it seems notable to me that many of the EPA’s deadlines do not reflect the long-term needs of the energy industry.” Power generating assets “typically have lives of 50 years,” he said, while the planning horizons for transmission facilities can be 3-8 years.”\\xa0 The switching of power sources envisaged by the EPA’s plan also means the planning, design and creation of “major backbone transmission lines where they do not currently exist.” Nebraska gets about 50 percent of its electrical energy from coal, Bracht said, and under the earlier version of the EPA’s rule, it was supposed to cut 26 per cent of its carbon emissions from 2012 levels. In the final rule that the states are not litigating, the total jumped to 40 per cent. And when it comes to shifting from coal to less carbon-emitting fuels like natural gas, he declared, “the coal-fired plant does not necessarily have a natural gas pipeline next to it for its replacement.”\\xa0 “There are very few people in the United States who don’t expect the lights to work when they turn them on,” he said. “The kind of disruption this shift implies might test that.”\",\n",
       " 'Much of the South was forecast to see temperatures drop 30 to 45 degrees in a 24-hour period thanks to yet another arctic cold front, according to the latest forecasts. ADVERTISEMENT Some locations may even see their coldest temperatures ever recorded so late in the season, including Nashville and Louisville, Kentucky, where temperatures may drop into the single digits. Meanwhile, areas farther north, such as Maryland and New Jersey, were already seeing snow early Thursday and federal workers in the Washington area were told to stay home. A wintry mix of precipitation fell Wednesday night in Memphis, where a sheet of ice coated the roads, making driving especially hazardous. Mississippi counties were advised to open shelters powered by generators to give residents an option beyond cold, dark homes in the event of power outages. Here\\'s a look at what\\'s happening: ___ WASHINGTON FEDERAL WORKERS The federal government says its offices in the Washington area will be closed Thursday because of a new round of winter weather expected in the region. The Office of Personnel Management says non-emergency personnel in and around Washington are granted excused absences for the day. Emergency employees and telework-ready employees are expected to work. ___ IS HIGHER FARE FAIR? With the nation\\'s capital about to be under a snow emergency, cab rides are about to become more expensive. The D.C. Taxicab Commission announced Wednesday that snow emergency fares will be in effect Thursday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. That means cabs can add a $15 surcharge to the metered fare. The surcharge is meant to entice cab drivers to keep working so people can use cabs as needed. ___ FINISHING A SHOVELING JOB First responders in Connecticut who tried to save a man\\'s life when he collapsed while shoveling snow off his roof returned to finish the work after he died. Fire Chief David Billings identified the man as Miroslaw Dabrowski. The 57-year-old Dabrowski suffered a heart attack. The emergency call came in at 9:45 a.m. Tuesday. Police officer Bernie Hallums said he and other officers climbed to the roof and started cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He was declared dead at Manchester Hospital. Later that morning, Hallums and other officers and firefighters returned to the house to finish removing snow from the roof. ___ CONGRESS FLEES FLURRIES The weather forecast got Congress going and produced rare bipartisan agreements in the House and in the Senate to finish business early and get out of town. Up to 8 inches of snow was in the forecast for Thursday morning. Senate leaders set the last vote of the week for 2:30 p.m. Wednesday. But that wasn\\'t good enough for Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma. \"Is there any way you could change that to 2:20 from 2:30?\" Inhofe asked on the Senate floor. \"There are four people who can\\'t make planes, otherwise.\" He was accommodated. ___ LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL? Mike Halpert, deputy director of the National Weather Service\\'s Climate Prediction Center, said the storm \"might be winter\\'s last hurrah.\" Likewise, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said the storm could be winter\\'s \"caboose.\" After the storm and possibly some cold days into the weekend, the next couple of weeks should be considerably warmer than normal for a large chunk of the country, Halpert said. The Climate Prediction Center predicted, however, colder-than-normal temperatures for New England. ___ ENJOYING A GAME BEFORE WINTER RETURNS Claire Greer was out enjoying a last few hours of warmth Wednesday afternoon in Starkville, Mississippi, even as cold air, high winds and icy precipitation plunged into parts of Mississippi to her north and west. Greer was watching Mississippi State University\\'s softball team play Georgia\\'s Kennesaw State University, dreading the moment when the wind would begin blowing from the north and winter would return. \"I\\'m ready for spring,\" the Starkville retiree said by telephone. \"That\\'s another reason I came out here to watch the girls play, before it gets cold.\" ___ BEWARE OF PRICE GOUGING West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey says the state\\'s price gouging laws are now in place. The anti-gouging law kicks in any time the governor declares a state of emergency or state or preparedness. Gov. Earl Ray Tomlin declared a state of emergency Thursday and mobilized state resources as a winter storm threatens to dump up to a foot of snow on the state. The state\\'s anti-gouging laws prohibit any person, business or contractor from inflating the price of a consumer item by more than 10 percent of what it sold for 10 days before a gubernatorial declaration. The law remains in place until the state of emergency or preparedness is lifted. Consumers who believe they have been price gouged can file a complaint with the Consumer Protection Division. ___ TWO MORE INCHES, PLEASE! Some Bostonians were clamoring for a little more snow so they can break a record. So far this winter, the city has received 105.5 inches of snow — more than 8 1/2 feet, the National Weather Service said. The record is 107.6 inches recorded during the 1995-96 season. Records date to 1872. Having endured weeks of misery, residents like Erin O\\'Brien insist they deserve bragging rights. Otherwise what was the point of repeatedly digging out? \"I want the record. We earned the record,\" said O\\'Brien, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. Others don\\'t care about the record. Amy Ouellette, a marketing associate in Salem, north of Boston, just wants spring and sun to come and melt it all away.',\n",
       " 'The campaign to stop President Barack Obama\\'s sweeping emissions limits on power plants began taking shape Wednesday, as 16 states asked the government to put the rules on hold while a Senate panel moved to block them. ADVERTISEMENT West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the charge against the rules, banded together with 15 other state attorneys general in a letter to Environmental Protection Agency head Gina McCarthy requesting that the agency temporarily suspend the rules while they challenge their legality in court. The letter called for the EPA to respond by Friday. The EPA and the White House both said they believe the limits are legal and have no plans to put them on hold. But by submitting the formal request anyway, the attorneys general are laying the groundwork to ask the courts to suspend the emissions limits instead. \"These regulations, if allowed to proceed, will do serious harm to West Virginia and the U.S. economy,\" Morrisey said. \"That is why we are taking quick action to bring this process to a halt.\" The 16 states and a handful of others are preparing to sue the Obama administration to block the rules permanently by arguing they exceed Obama\\'s authority. Bolstered by a recent Supreme Court ruling against the administration\\'s mercury limits, opponents argued that states shouldn\\'t have to start preparing to comply with a rule that may eventually get thrown out by the courts. The speedy opposition from the states came two days after Obama unveiled the final version of the rules, which mark the first time the U.S. has ever limited carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. Obama\\'s revised plan mandates a 32 percent cut in emissions nationwide by 2030, compared to 2005 levels — a steeper cut than in his earlier proposal. Most of the attorneys general signing the letter Wednesday are Republicans. Yet they were joined by Jack Conway of the coal-producing state of Kentucky. Conway and Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear are both Democrats, but have joined the state\\'s Republican leaders in denouncing Obama\\'s power plant limits, which form the centerpiece of his plan to fight climate change. Although the most serious threat to Obama\\'s power plant rules is in the courts, lawmakers in Congress are also pursuing legislative means to stop them. The first vote came Wednesday in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, where a bill blocking the rules passed the GOP-controlled panel by a voice vote — but not without a bit of drama. Over the protests of boycotting Democrats, the Senate GOP-controlled panel approved legislation designed to block the Obama administration from implementing the tough new standards. Democrats walked out of the committee meeting in protest of a separate bill about pesticides, arguing it should have been the subject of a fact-finding hearing. Lacking the necessary quorum for a vote, Republican Chairman Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma reconvened the meeting in a lunchroom just off the Senate floor, where the aroma of a just-completed GOP lunch was still wafting in the air. The voice vote approving the bill sends it to the full Senate, where a filibuster battle awaits. Obama has vowed to veto any such legislation, and Republicans have yet to prove they can muster the votes to override his veto.',\n",
       " 'Emails obtained by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal) show that the offices of New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and those of other politically aligned AGs, secretly teamed up with anti-fossil fuel activists to launch investigations against groups whose political speech challenged the global warming policy agenda. \\xa0 ADVERTISEMENT These emails, obtained under open records laws, shed light on what followed after a January meeting,\\xa0 \\xa0the\\xa0Wall Street Journal on April 14, in which groups funded by anti-fossil fuel Rockefeller interests met to urge just this sort of investigation and litigation against political opponents. \\xa0 Recently, after the think tank the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) criticized the AGs’ intimidation campaign, U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Claude Earl Walker — one of the AGs \\xa0working with Schneiderman — subpoenaed ten years of the non-profit organization’s records relating to climate change.\\xa0\\xa0 The latest email release strongly suggests a financial incentive for AGs to pursue their political opponents, rather than merely silencing and scaring away support for those who dare disagree with their extreme global warming agenda. \\xa0 The e-mail correspondence between Schneiderman’s staff, the offices of several state attorneys general, and various activists covers the weeks leading up to a March 29 “ ” press conference with former Vice President Al Gore, to announce the targeting of opponents of the global warming agenda.\\xa0\\xa0 The correspondence shows government officials actively trying to hide their coordination, by using a “Common Interest Agreement.”\\xa0 This sought to protect as privileged the discussions about defending President Obama’s controversial global warming rules, and going after political opponents using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Most intriguingly, this sought to hide discussions among the AGs, “their staff and certain outside advisors”.\\xa0These communications and coordination included: Pawa and Frumhoff have been pushing for this investigation for years, at least since a 2012\\xa0 \\xa0entitled “Establishing Accountability for Climate Change Denial,” a brainstorming session in California for activists on ways to convince state attorneys general to investigate “deniers” using RICO laws. As the Vermont and New York correspondence show, Pawa and Frumhoff were invited to secretly brief the state attorneys general.\\xa0 They each received 45 minutes to provide arguments on “climate change litigation” and “the imperative of taking action now” immediately prior to the AGs’ press conference, according to schedules prepared by Schneiderman’s office. The next day, March 30, Pawa wrote to Eric Srolovic of Schneiderman’s office and Vermont’s Scott Kline seeking help. A\\xa0Wall Street Journal\\xa0reporter wanted to talk to Pawa, and he asked the two officials: “What should I say if she asks if I attended?” Srolovic replied: “My ask is if you speak to the reporter, to not confirm that you attended or otherwise discuss the event.” The documents obtained by E&E Legal also include responses to a questionnaire sent to the state attorneys general by Schneiderman’s office.\\xa0 U.S. Virgin Islands AG Walker reveals his interest, having just completed an $800 million settlement from Hess Oil company, in “identifying other potential litigation targets” and ways to “increase our leverage.” The Hess money, Walker wrote, was used to create an “environmental response trust”.

       " 'The Supreme Court has so far resisted elaborating on two landmark decisions that established a nationwide right to defend one\\'s home with a gun. ADVERTISEMENT That could change with a new appeal filed by gun owners that challenges a Chicago suburb\\'s assault weapons ban. The appeal by Dr. Arie Friedman and the Illinois State Rifle Association argues that the City of Highland Park has violated their constitutional rights by banning some of the most popular semi-automatic guns in the United States, as well as ammunition clips of more than 10 rounds. The justices put off consideration of the appeal last week. In recent years, the court has almost always deferred action on an appeal before agreeing to take it up. The court could say as early as Monday whether it will hear the case. Friedman is a practicing pediatrician and owner of semi-automatic weapons. He lost a bid for the state Senate as a Republican in 2012 in a campaign in which some conservatives complained about his support for abortion rights. In recent days, Friedman has used his Twitter account to offer tips for Israelis who want to arm themselves in public. He did not respond to messages left with his medical practice. The Supreme Court\\'s 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller and the 2010 decision in McDonald v. Chicago focused mainly on the right to defend one\\'s own home. Gun rights groups have failed repeatedly to get the justices to say how broadly the Second Amendment protects gun rights. The court has turned away challenges to gun laws at least three other times in cases that involved whether people have a right to be armed in public. Even though lower courts have mainly upheld gun restrictions, the Highland Park case arises out of a decision by the federal appeals court in Chicago that struck down the only statewide ban on carrying concealed weapons, in Illinois. In 2013, when state lawmakers reacted to the court ruling by making it legal to carry a gun, they gave cities around the state 10 days to come up with local restrictions on assault weapons, or forfeit their right to do so. Highland Park was one of fewer than 20 municipalities, all in the Chicago area, to enact regulations or bans, according to the rifle association. The city\\'s assault weapons ban was upheld by the appeals court in a 2-1 decision. \"If a ban on semi-automatic guns and large-capacity magazines reduces the perceived risk from a mass shooting and makes the public feel safer as a result, that\\'s a substantial benefit,\" Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote for the court. Variations of the Bushmaster AR-15, one of the guns specifically banned by Highland Park, were used in the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre and the theater shootings in Aurora, Colorado. In dissent, Judge Daniel A. Manion said individuals, not elected officials, get to choose which guns they prefer for self-defense. \"To limit self-defense to only those methods acceptable to the government\" creates an \"enormous transfer of authority from the citizens of this country to the government — a result directly contrary to our Constitution and to our political tradition,\" Manion wrote. Twenty-four states and other gun-rights groups are supporting the appeal at the Supreme Court. The justices\\' refusal to say more about gun rights has allowed, even encouraged, federal judges to take a narrow view of the meaning of the Second Amendment, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said on behalf of the states. \"It is time for this court to intervene.\" The case is Friedman v. City of Highland Park, 15-133.',\n",

All but two of the 24 states filing challenges are led by Republicans. They deride the plan as an \"unlawful power grab by Washington bureaucrats\" that will kill coal mining jobs and drive up electricity costs.\\xa0 \"The Clean Power Plan is one of the most far-reaching energy regulations in this nation\\'s history,\" said West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, among those leading the challenges. \"I have a responsibility to protect the lives of millions of working families, the elderly and the poor, from such illegal and unconscionable federal government actions.\"\\xa0 The Obama administration and environmental groups counter that the rules are needed to cut carbon emissions while curbing the worst impacts of climate change and sea-level rise. They also say the plan will spur new clean-energy jobs.\\xa0 The new rules would require states to cut carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030. Each state has a customized target and is responsible for drawing up an effective plan to meet its goal.\\xa0 \"We expect polluters and their allies to throw everything they\\'ve got at the Clean Power Plan, and we expect them to fail,\" said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, among those defending the law. \"The Clean Power Plan is based on a law passed by Congress, upheld by the Supreme Court, and demanded by the American people.\"\\xa0 The EPA says it has authority to enact the plan under the Clean Air Act. At issue are dueling provisions added to the law by the House and Senate in 1990. The EPA\\'s interpretation relies on the Senate language, but opponents argue that the House version should win out.\\xa0 \"We are confident we will again prevail against these challenges and will be able to work with states to successfully implement these first-ever national standards to limit carbon pollution, the largest source of carbon emissions in the United States,\" said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy.\\xa0 EPA already regulates other power-plant pollutants under a different section of the Clean Air Act, and the opponents claim the law prohibits \"double regulation.\"\\xa0 Morrisey said he will seek a stay barring the plan from taking effect while the court challenges proceed, a question that will likely be up to the Supreme Court.\\xa0 The states challenging the plan in court are Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming and Wisconsin.\\xa0 There is some political variation within the list.

ADVERTISEMENT In a Thursday letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the group specifically criticized the administration’s decision to allow insurance companies to sell policies that would otherwise be out of compliance with the Affordable Care Act for another year. The group says the insurance “fix” flies in the face of both federal and state law because it “compounds illegal executive action.” “We support allowing citizens to keep their health insurance coverage, but the only way to fix this problem-ridden law is to enact changes lawfully; through congressional action,” the letter states. The attorneys general also express concern over the security of the ObamaCare enrollment exchanges, and accuse the administration of ignoring the potential vulnerability of consumer information. “As attorneys general, we take the privacy of our states' consumers very seriously and are deeply concerned about the Administration's decision not to propose and implement rigorous privacy standards for outreach personnel,” the letter states.

They say the law allows appeals to delay jail sentences only in \"exceptional circumstances.\" Blankenship is scheduled to report to prison May 12. \"None of defendant\\'s contentions raise a substantial question likely to result in reversal,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Ruby wrote in a filing submitted Monday night to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Blankenship was sentenced April 6 to a year in prison and ordered to pay a $250,000 fine for conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards at Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia. A jury convicted him Dec. 3. The coal mine exploded in 2010, killing 29 men. Blankenship\\'s attorneys say he could serve much, or all, of his sentence before the appellate court reaches a decision.

       " 'A federal appeals court affirmed the criminal conviction of former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship on Thursday in connection with the deadliest U.S. mine disaster in four decades. ADVERTISEMENT The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the evidence shows Massey was repeatedly cited for safety violations at West Virginia\\'s Upper Big Branch coal mine before the 2010 explosion that killed 29 men. In 2009 alone, the U.S. Mine Safety & Health Administration identified 549 violations there, the court noted. Blankenship was aware of violations, receiving daily reports, Judge James Wynn wrote. Many concerned improper ventilation and accumulation of combustible materials. \"Notwithstanding the numerous citations and warnings, defendant has a \\'policy to invariably press for more production even at mines that he knew were struggling to keep up with the safety laws,\\'\" Wynn wrote. Chief Judge Roger Gregory and Senior Judge Andre Davis agreed. Blankenship was convicted in 2015 of a misdemeanor, conspiring to violate the federal mining safety law, and sentenced to a maximum year in prison. The 66-year-old is scheduled for release May 10. Blogging from a federal prison in California, he has called himself an \"American political prisoner.\" A call to his attorney William Taylor was not immediately returned Thursday. The three-judge panel rejected the argument by Blankenship\\'s attorneys that jury instructions about \"reckless disregard\" for the consequences of his decisions made it too easy to conclude that he willfully violated safety rules. The court also rejected arguments by the Ohio, Illinois and Virginia coal associations that this willfulness standard represents \"an expansion of criminal law to the point that mere involvement of company management in certain affairs can serve as a basis, in whole or in part, for criminal prosecution.\" Wynn wrote that \"Congress intended to bring conduct evidencing reckless disregard within the meaning of \\'willfully.\\'\" \"In particular, Congress imposed enhanced penalties in the Mine Safety Act because it found \\'mine operators still find it cheaper to pay minimal civil penalties than to make the capital investments necessary to adequately abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions,\\'\" he wrote. Holding mine operators personally criminally liable is meant to deter large corporations from choosing production over safety compliance because financial penalties won\\'t do it, Wynn wrote. Blankenship was also fined the $250,000 maximum permitted by law. He was acquitted of securities fraud at the six-week trial. ___ Information from: The Charleston Gazette-Mail, http://wvgazettemail.com.',\n",
       " 'Even before his release from prison 10 years ago, Brett Kimberlin had learned a lesson that has served him well: If you publicly accuse a well-known political figure of crimes or misdeeds -- even without proof -- publicity and money will follow. ADVERTISEMENT Kimberlin, a convicted bomber and drug dealer, learned that lesson in 1988, when he claimed from his prison cell that he had been Dan Quayle’s marijuana dealer in college. The claim got a lot of attention because Quayle was running for vice president of the United States at the time. Now, 22 years later, Kimberlin has taken that lesson and made unfounded accusations a profession of sorts. Using two popular leftist blogs, the 56-year-old from Bethesda, Md., has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from the public and left-leaning foundations by promising to put conservatives he disagrees with in jail, often with offers of large rewards. So far -- without success -- he has called for the arrest of Karl Rove, Andrew Breitbart, Chamber of Commerce head Tom Donohue, Massey Energy Chairman Don Blankenship and other high-profile public figures. A review of tax filings for Kimberlin\\'s blogs, \"Velvet Revolution\" and \"Justice Through Music,\" raises troubling questions about whether his \"nonprofit\" operations are dedicated to public activism -- or are just a new facade for a longtime con artist. Though neither website publicly reveals Kimberlin’s role, tax and corporate documents show that he is one of four directors who incorporated the Velvet Revolution, and that he is the registered agent for the tax-exempt, non-stock company, which is registered at his mother’s house in Bethesda. In 2008, the last year for which tax records are available, Velvet Revolution took in $83,000 in gifts and contributions. Kimberlin is also one of two incorporators of Justice Through Music, as well as a $19,500-a-year employee of the non-profit, whose purpose is to “shed light on some of the injustices of the world through music” and which took in more than $550,000 in contributions in 2008. What those who view the blogs -- and those who donate to them -- aren’t told is who Kimberlin is and where he\\'s been. And that is a twisted story, indeed. Kimberlin grew up in a suburb of Indianapolis where, just out of high school, he ran a large-scale marijuana operation as well as a health food store and a vegetarian restaurant. According to accounts at the time and public records, he became involved with an underage girl whose grandmother objected to the relationship and tried to take her away. When the grandmother was found shot to death in her garage, police began focusing on Kimberlin, who -- possibly to divert attention -- began an eight-day bombing campaign in Speedway, Ind. That bombing spree did more than cause widespread terror in Speedway; it severely injured a man who had to have his leg amputated and who, unable to cope with the pain, later committed suicide. His widow sued Kimberlin\\xa0and was awarded a $1.6 million civil judgment. In the same period as the bombing spree, in 1978, Kimberlin was arrested in Texas while preparing to receive a plane carrying 5 tons of marijuana at a makeshift air strip he and his compatriots had scratched out of the desert. The operation was so big, it supplied marijuana to at least four states, according to authorities and local news reports at the time. To help with the operation, Kimberlin would often assume the false identity of an official from the Department of Defense. That operation fell apart when a local printer, whom Kimberlin had asked to create a false federal ID card, reported him to authorities, and he was charged with impersonating a federal official. After separate trials for the bombings, the drug offenses and the impersonation charges -- he was suspected but never charged with the grandmother\\'s murder -- Kimberlin was sentenced to more than 50 years in federal prison. And it was there that he learned the power of unsubstantiated accusation. Just before the 1988 election Kimberlin caused a sensation when he told reporters he had been Quayle’s marijuana supplier in college. As word of the accusation spread, a prison press conference was called and then canceled as reporters waited outside. But that action by prison officials gave Kimberlin\\'s story credence, and he declared himself a political prisoner -- a claim that attracted Mark Singer, a writer from The New Yorker magazine, who thought it would make for a great story. After Singer ran a long sympathetic piece in 1992, he got a book contract to write about the fate of an American political prisoner. The two split a large cash advance from the publisher and began to work together. In the process, Singer discovered that Kimberlin was far from a hero. In fact, he realized, the man who had gotten the attention of the nation was a liar and a con man, and he ended up writing a story of how he had been taken in by a “narcissist.” Kimberlin, for his part, who had been released on parole after 14 years in prison, was sent back to jail for a parole violation. The charge was hiding the money from his advance to prevent the widow of the woman whose husband he maimed from collecting on the bombing victim widow\\'s civil judgment. And it is that civil judgment that may explain Kimberlin\\'s blog sites and much of his existence since prison. Because of the judgment, which with interest is now more than $3 million, anything Kimberlin has in his own name is subject to seizure. He lives in his mother’s home in Bethesda and operates the websites out of there. It\\'s hardly a happy place, though; Kimberlin\\'s mother has sued him and won a $150,000 judgment against him, and he and his wife have traded domestic abuse charges, according to local records. It even may explain the causes of the moment on which the websites focus their energy, likely to generate cash. In the past three years, Velvet Revolution and Justice Through Music have raised more than $1.5 million. Yet Velvet Revolution hardly seems like a dynamic organization; it has had only 10 new posts in the past six months. And Justice Through Music, despite a voter registration effort that simply includes an online registration form, seems to be little more than a music website that plows through money each year. Perhaps the most perplexing question on the sites\\' tax returns concerns the growing rent payments from the non-profit, which jumped from just below $10,000 in 2006 to more than $80,000 two years later. Given Kimberlin’s history, what really happened to the money is a fair question. And given his silence -- calls and messages to Kimberlin, both through the blog and to his home address, were not returned -- it is a pressing one.\\xa0',\n",

ADVERTISEMENT He is scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday in Charleston federal court. Legal experts say just as important as the length of his sentence is whether he will stay free pending his appeal. If he heads to prison before an appellate decision, his defense attorneys say the decision may not come until after his whole sentence is served. Blankenship was convicted Dec. 3 of a misdemeanor conspiracy to willfully violate mine safety standards at Upper Big Branch Mine.

       " 'A judge sentenced former\\xa0coal\\xa0executive Don Blankenship to a year in prison Wednesday for his role in the deadliest U.S. mine explosion in four decades, saying he was part of a \"dangerous conspiracy.\" ADVERTISEMENT One day after the sixth anniversary of the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion, which killed 29 men, U.S. District Judge Irene Berger gave the ex-Massey Energy CEO the maximum prison time and fine of $250,000. A federal jury convicted Blankenship on Dec. 3 of a misdemeanor conspiracy to violate mine safety standards at Upper Big Branch. Blankenship spoke briefly during the sentencing hearing and said he wanted to reassure the families of the fallen miners that they were \"great guys, great\\xa0coal\\xa0miners.\" The main point he wanted to express, he said, was \"sorrow to the families and everyone about what happened.\" In his next breath, he denied culpability. \"It is important to everyone that you know that I\\'m not guilty of a crime,\" Blankenship said. Blankenship\\'s attorneys contended he should receive probation and a fine, at most. The judge denied their motion for Blankenship to remain free as he appeals. It\\'s not clear when he must report to prison. As Blankenship left the courthouse, a few family members of miners who were killed started yelling at him while he and his attorneys spoke with reporters. \"We buried our kid because of you,\" said Robert Atkins, whose son Jason died in the explosion. \"That\\'s all I got is a goddamn tombstone.\" Asked by a reporter what he had to say to the shouting family members, Blankenship said: \"Well, just that the\\xa0coal\\xa0miners didn\\'t cause the accident.\" Then about a half-dozen law enforcement officers surrounded Blankenship and his team and ushered them into an awaiting van. Four investigations found worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited accumulations of\\xa0coal\\xa0dust and methane gas. Broken and clogged water sprayers then allowed what should have been a minor flare-up to become an inferno. Blankenship disputes those reports. He believes natural gas in the mine, and not methane gas and excess\\xa0coal\\xa0dust, was at the root of the explosion. The sentence drew praise from U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin and the United Mine Workers of America, and capped a wide-spanning investigation into Massey following the explosion. Four other workers in the corporate chain were convicted of crimes including faking a foreman\\'s license, lying to federal investigators and conspiring in an illegal scheme to warn miners and other subsidiaries of surprise safety inspections. Their sentences ranged from less than a year to more than three years in prison. The judge described Blankenship\\'s rise from a meager, single-mother Appalachian household to one of the wealthiest, most influential figures in the region and in the\\xa0coal\\xa0industry. \"Instead of being to be able to tout you as a success story, we are here as a result of your part in a dangerous conspiracy,\" she said. During the trial, prosecutors called Blankenship a bullish micromanager who meddled in the smallest details of Upper Big Branch. They said Massey\\'s safety programs were just a facade — never backed by more money to hire additional miners or take more time on safety tasks. Blankenship was acquitted of felonies that could have stretched his sentence to 30 years. On Wednesday, lead defense attorney William Taylor said the former U.S. attorney was \"using this case as part of the reason to vote for him.\" Booth Goodwin left the office shortly after Blankenship\\'s conviction to run for governor. \"Well, when all else fails, attack the prosecutor,\" Goodwin said after the sentencing. In 2011, Alpha Natural Resources, which bought Massey after the explosion, agreed to pay $210 million to compensate grieving families, bankroll cutting-edge safety improvements and pay for years of violations by Massey Energy. Under the deal with federal prosecutors, Alpha wasn\\'t criminally charged. The judge already ruled that Blankenship won\\'t have to pay $28 million in restitution to Alpha Natural Resources, helping him avoid a serious blow to his personal fortune. Berger also ruled that Blankenship would not have to pay restitution to about 100 people, including former miners and family members.',\n",
       " 'Former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship was convicted Thursday on one of three counts connected to a deadly coal mine explosion and acquitted of two other charges. ADVERTISEMENT Blankenship was convicted on a misdemeanor conspiracy count but acquitted of making false statements and securities fraud. A 12-member jury returned the verdicts for the former coal industry executive in U.S. District Court in Charleston. Blankenship was tried on charges of conspiring to break safety laws and defrauding mine regulators at West Virginia\\'s Upper Big Branch Mine, and lying to financial regulators and investors about safety. The mine exploded in 2010, killing 29 men. The conviction becomes the centerpiece of a wide-spanning investigation into Massey that began after the explosion. The probe produced four other convictions up the Massey corporate chain, leading to Blankenship. Relatives of the miners who died have long called for Blankenship to go to prison. During the trial, which began Oct. 1, prosecutors contended that Blankenship was a bullish micromanager who knew about and meddled in the smallest details of Upper Big Branch. Prosecutors said Massey\\'s safety programs really were just a facade -- never backed by more money to hire additional miners or take more time on safety tasks. And prosecutors consistently reminded jurors that a conspiracy doesn\\'t have to be spelled out formally between parties. \"The defendant wants you to reward him for being smart enough not to come right out and say, `I want you to break the law,\"\\' Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Ruby told jurors in closing arguments. \"He wants you to let him off the hook because he was careful enough to come right up to the line of putting it explicitly, putting it into words without doing it. Don\\'t do that.\" Blankenship\\'s defense made a rare, risky move by not calling a single witness in the case. His attorneys said there wasn\\'t a shred of evidence that Blankenship was involved in a conspiracy. \"We don\\'t convict people in this country on the basis of maybes,\" lead defense attorney William Taylor said in his closing argument. \"We don\\'t convict them of crimes because they are rich or they are rude or they are tough. We require the government to prove more than that a man was in charge of a company when a terrible tragedy occurred.\" Prosecutors made their case with Blankenship\\'s own voice, using phone calls he secretly recorded in his Massey office. In key calls, Blankenship said a scathing internal safety memo should be kept highly confidential, and that it would be a terrible document to show up in legal discovery if there was a mine fatality. Under defense cross-examination, Christopher Blanchard -- who ran the subsidiary that oversaw Upper Big Branch -- said Blankenship and Massey pushed for safety. Testifying to prosecutors, Blanchard said he believed Blankenship thought it was less expensive to pay fines than pay for measures to prevent safety violations. He also said most Upper Big Branch violations could have been prevented by hiring more miners or spending more time on safety tasks. Former Massey safety expert William Ross, who gave a tough review of the company\\'s safety shortcomings, wept while testifying about how thrilled he had been to think that Massey was going to change. He also became emotional while talking about a 2009 meeting with Blankenship, in which he told the executive that Massey couldn\\'t \"afford to have a disaster.\"',\n",

       " 'JULIAN, W.Va. -- The coal mine rocked by an explosion that killed at least 25 workers in the nation\\'s deadliest mining disaster since 1984 had been cited for 600 violations in less than a year and a half, some of them for not properly ventilating methane -- the highly combustible gas suspected in the blast. ADVERTISEMENT The disaster at the Upper Big Branch mine has focused attention on the business and safety practices of the owner, Massey Energy, a powerful and politically connected company in Appalachia known for producing big profits, as well as big piles of safety and environmental violations and big damage awards for grieving widows. \"There are mines in this country who have operated safely for 20 years,\" said J. Davitt McAteer, head of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration in the Clinton administration. \"There are mines who take precautions ahead of time. There are mines who spend the money and manpower to do it.\" He added: \"Those mines haven\\'t been blown up.\" Four other miners were missing and feared dead underground in Monday\\'s blast, believed to have been caused by a buildup of methane, a naturally occurring gas that is odorless and colorless. Last year alone, MSHA cited Upper Big Branch for 495 violations and proposed $911,802 in fines. Production more than tripled during that period, according to federal records. So far this year, the agency has found 105 violations at the mine. Upper Big Branch is one of Massey\\'s biggest underground mines, with more than 200 employees, and it is not uncommon for big coal mines to amass hundreds of violations a year -- and to contest many of them, as Massey does. But most big mines don\\'t have as many serious infractions as Upper Big Branch, industry experts said. At least 50 citations charge the company with \"unwarrantable failure\" to comply with safety standards such as following an approved ventilation plan, controlling combustible materials or designating escape routes. \"I\\'ve never seen that many for one mine in a year,\" said Ellen Smith, editor of Mine Safety & Health News. \"If you look at other mines that are the same size or bigger, they do not have the sheer number of `unwarrantable\\' citations that this mine has.\" Massey has had problems elsewhere, too. In 2006, two miners were killed in a fire at Massey\\'s Aracoma Alma No. 1 mine. Massey settled a wrongful death lawsuit for an undisclosed sum, and its subsidiary Aracoma Coal Co. paid $4.2 million in civil and criminal penalties. Testimony showed Massey CEO Don Blankenship suggested firing two supervisors for raising concerns about conveyer belt problems just before the belt caught fire. \"Massey has a history of emphasizing production,\" said Pittsburgh lawyer Bruce Stanley, who represented the miners\\' widows. \"I\\'m concerned that they may not have learned the lessons of Aracoma.\" In an interview less than 24 hours after the disaster at Upper Big Branch, Blankenship insisted the mine is no more dangerous than others of comparable size, and he defended the company\\'s track record in a perilous business. \"It\\'s natural that the enemies of coal would view Massey as the primary enemy,\" he said. He pointed out Massey\\'s many innovations, such as installing steps in place of ladders and putting protective cages on underground vehicles even though the government doesn\\'t require them. \"I think that I\\'ve proven that we run safer coal mines -- you know, most of the time -- and accidents sometimes happen. We\\'ve got to figure out what happened here,\" he said. Kevin Stricklin, an MSHA administrator, said that the number of citations at the mine appeared high, and that he was concerned about the more serious violations. \"It means the operator was aware of some of these conditions,\" he said. Massey is contesting 36 percent of all violations at Upper Big Branch since 2007, The Associated Press found. Overall, U.S. mine operators contest 27 percent. Challenging violations can enable a mine owner to stave off the heavier punishment that the government can impose on companies that have been deemed repeat offenders. Massey became a political and industrial powerhouse under the guidance of Blankenship, who rose from poverty to become one of corporate America\\'s highest-paid and least apologetic executives, a guy who proudly displays in his office a TV set with a bullet hole from a striking union miner\\'s rifle. He freely spent millions of dollars from his personal fortune to help install a West Virginia   justice, a maneuver that led to an important conflict-of-interest ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, and on a failed bid to elect a Republican majority in the state Legislature. Under Blankenship, Massey clawed to the top of the Appalachian coal industry, shrewdly buying up coal deposits to amass more than 2 billion tons of reserves. It is a major economic force regionally, with more than 6,000 high-paid miners in some of the poorest counties in America. Operating nonunion mines across southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southwestern Virginia, Massey more than doubled its profit to $104.4 million in 2009 from the year before, despite slumping demand for coal amid the recession. The company expects to be shipping 2 million tons of coal a year to   by next year. Massey has managed to push the United Mine Workers union out of all of its operations except for a single processing plant. Blankenship\\'s hard-driving approach was illustrated in a 2005 memo in which he told mine workers that if their bosses ask them to build roof supports or perform similar tasks, \"ignore them and run coal.\" \"This memo is necessary only because we seem not to understand that the coal pays the bills,\" he wrote. Few workers are willing to openly criticize Massey because of its powerful hold on people\\'s livelihoods in Appalachia. But Terry Holstein, who worked at Upper Big Branch, said it took him 10 years to decide he didn\\'t like the way Massey ran the mine. He left in 2006. \"It was like they wanted production more than they wanted safety, myself, you know what I mean?\" he said. \"They speak safety first, but production\\'s really first for them.\"',\n",
       " 'PETTUS, W.Va. (AP) — A pair of tall black boots and a lunch pail sat near the altar Sunday at the New Life Assembly church — a memorial to the 29 men killed in the worst U.S. mining disaster since 1970 and a thank-you to those who make their living inside the mountains. ADVERTISEMENT This day, the first Sunday since last Monday\\'s explosion killed 28 workers and a contractor at Massey Energy Co.\\'s Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, was for many a time to honor the profession. Tears of mourning fell, and arms swayed in worship among the 50 people gathered at the church. Pastor  , who has worked at Massey Energy mines for 18 years, knew many of the victims. On his way to church Sunday morning, he heard Ricky Workman\\'s name among them for the first time. \"I know his child. I know his wife. He\\'s a part of my family. He\\'s a part of my life,\" Williams said, tears falling. \"Over time, our hearts and the emptiness that we have inside will fade away, but I don\\'t never want to forget what happened April 5, 2010.\" Some of those who died have already been laid to rest. Crews worked Sunday to remove the bodies of several others who didn\\'t make it out, but the recovery had to be halted because of high gas readings in the mine. Crews need to drill another hole to vent the mine before they can continue. Four funerals were held Friday, with more scheduled for the weekend. Nearly two dozen will follow in the weeks ahead. Despite hope that four missing miners might survive long enough for rescuers to reach them, officials announced early Saturday morning that the four had apparently died instantly. A complete list of victims has yet to be released. Two other miners were injured in the blast, and one remains hospitalized. A team of federal investigators will arrive Monday as officials try to figure out what caused the blast. Virginia-based Massey has been under scrutiny for a string of safety violations at the mine, though CEO Don Blankenship has defended the company\\'s record and disputed accusations that he puts profits ahead of safety. Authorities have said that high levels of volatile methane gas may have played a role in the disaster. Massey has been repeatedly cited and fined for problems with the system that vents methane and for allowing combustible dust to build up. During a homily in Wheeling on Sunday, Catholic Bishop Michael J. Bransfield said four years is too short a time between West Virginia mine disasters. The last was at the Sago Mine in 2006, where 12 men perished. \"Can those entrusted with the protection of miners be trusted to fulfill the jobs and enforce the laws?\" he said. \"Is our technology in the U.S. mines in 2010 equal to the technology that is easily available in other industries? Is it safer to travel in space than to work in a West Virginia mine?\" At churches in the southern West Virginia coalfields, however, the focus was on reflection. Judy Walker, whose longtime friend Workman died in the accident, stood before the altar at New Life Assembly in tears, mourning the heartache of families she helped cook for this week as they awaited word of their loved ones\\' fates. \"All we can do is love on them. When you see them out, hug on them,\" she said. \"Just let them talk about their fathers, brothers and sons.\" The tragedy has shaken many in this region filled with coal mines, where many people make their living in the mines or know someone who does. After all, the work is generally stable and pays better than most other jobs in the area. Indeed, Walker\\'s husband of 38 years, Butch, won\\'t tell her about his worries underground. Several followers, including the pastor\\'s wife, thanked the miners in the congregation for the work they do. \"A lot of people ask, Why do they do it? Why do they go into the mines and put theirselves in danger?\" said Ina Williams. \"It\\'s West Virginia. They sacrifice whatever they need to do to support their families.\" She then turned to her husband, a black ribbon and tiny gold cross pinned to his pale yellow shirt, and thanked him — not only for the work he does underground, but for the way he\\'s represented the communities along the Big Coal River this week. \"He has shown over and over, especially this week, God\\'s love. He loves this community, he loved those men, he loves these people,\" she said. \"These men are not going to be forgotten.\"',\n",
       " 'MULLENS, W.Va. -- Grieving relatives began burying victims of the Upper Big Branch coal mine disaster Friday as rescue crews ventured back into the blast-damaged shaft for another agonizingly slow, dangerous and probably hopeless search for survivors. ADVERTISEMENT It was their fourth attempt to find the four miners missing since Monday\\'s explosion killed 25 others in the nation\\'s worst underground disaster since at least 1984. During the previous rescue attempts, searchers were forced to withdraw by dangerous gases and the risk of fire or explosion. \"We are praying for a miracle,\" President   said in Washington. Rescuers acknowledged that was what it would take for the miners to have made it to a refuge chamber stocked with food, water and enough oxygen for several days. On Friday morning, rescuers made their way about 1,000 feet underground and five miles into the mine to examine one of the chambers, but no one was inside and smoke forced them to turn back before they could check a second one that would represent the last hope the four were alive. \"We\\'re confident that if they got in there, and they were alive, that we would be able to still rescue them,\" said Kevin Stricklin of the federal Mine Health and Safety Administration. The area was flushed with nitrogen and crews headed back inside in the afternoon for what was likely to be a three- or four-hour trip to the chamber, an expandable box activated by opening a door and pulling a lever. Officials had hoped to lower a camera into the mine to see if the chamber had been used, but the hole was drilled slightly off target, and Stricklin said they would not have been able to see anything. More than 300 people packed the Mullens Pentecostal Holiness Church for the funeral of Benny Willingham, a 61-year-old miner who was five weeks from retiring when he died. He was saved 19 years ago this week, said Rev. Gary Pollard, pastor of the Mullens Family Worship Center, where Willingham was a deacon. The two had weekly 45-minute talks -- about God, about Christian living, about their families and friends -- every Sunday morning for the past five years. Pollard said the last time he saw Willingham, the miner\\'s words were almost prophetic: \"If I die tomorrow, I\\'ve lived a good life.\" \"He wasn\\'t the biggest man in town. He didn\\'t have the stature of some of you sitting here,\" said Pollard, whose own church across town was too small for the crowd. \"But if you could see the size of this man\\'s heart, you\\'d see a giant.\" Willingham was dressed in a red shirt in the open coffin, jet-black hair and mustache neatly combed, family snapshots tucked in the satin around his head and shoulders. The image of a pick, shovel and miner\\'s helmet was embroidered in the fabric along with his name, and a flag draped the lower half of his coffin in a nod to his service during the   era in the Air Force. Three Air Force veterans, friends of his for more than 40 years, traveled with their wives from Ohio, California and North Carolina to say goodbye. \"That\\'s astonishing,\" said the Rev. Lewis Arnold, pastor of the host church, \"but that is Benny Willingham.\" Officials suspect the blast was caused by a buildup of methane gas. In the nation\\'s capital, Obama said he asked federal mine safety officials to give him a report on the disaster next week, and the House and Senate said they would hold hearings. In the days since the explosion, details have emerged about a long list of safety violations at the mine. The owner, Massey Energy Co., has been repeatedly cited and fined for problems with the system that vents methane and for allowing combustible dust to build up. CEO Don Blankenship has strongly defended the company\\'s record and disputed accusations from miners that he puts coal profits ahead of safety. Federal regulators issued evacuation orders for all or parts of the mine more than 60 times since the start of 2009, according to a report prepared for Sen.  , D-W.Va. On Sept. 23, 2009, an evacuation order showed an inspector found that management considered production more important than safety twice at Upper Big Branch mine for skipping mandatory checks of a piece of heavy equipment. Management\\'s conduct was more than ordinary negligence because \"production was deemed more important than conducting parameter checks on the continuous mining machine,\" according to the inspector\\'s notes released Friday by the Mine Health and Safety Administration. The citation said the mine operator complied with the requirements later that day. In 2007, the mine met criteria to be declared by MSHA to have a pattern of violations. That would have allowed stricter oversight by the federal agency and could have led to the shutdown of the mine, but Massey was able to reduce the number of the most serious violations and avoid the declaration. Pam Napper, whose 25-year-old son Josh died in the explosion, said the young man had been sent home from work early on the Friday before the disaster. \"He said, `Mom, the ventilation\\'s bad,\"\\' she recalled. \"And they sent him out of the mines. Everybody. He went back to work Monday.\" Before that, apparently over Easter weekend, he wrote a letter to his mother, his fiancee and his 19-month-old daughter, telling them that he would be looking down from heaven if anything happened to him. \"I just knew that Josh in his heart knew that something was going to happen,\" Pam Napper said. Of the 25 confirmed dead, 18 bodies remained inside the mine, and Stricklin said crews will turn their attention to removing those once they determine whether anyone is still alive. About two dozen people gathered outside one of the entrances to Upper Big Branch in show of support, waving signs reading \"Praying for 4 miracles\" and \"Gold Bless WV Coal Miners.\" \"You\\'ve got to think there\\'s hope. That\\'s all we got,\" 65-year-old John Bell said at a diner nearby.',\n",
       " 'More than 1,400 samples collected inside West Virginia\\'s Upper Big Branch mine show excessive amounts of coal dust were present before an explosion killed 29 miners in April, a federal official said Friday. ADVERTISEMENT A majority of the samples came from areas affected by the explosion, but show only that coal dust played a role in the blast, Mine Safety and Health Administration official Kevin Stricklin said during a conference call with reporters. \"It\\'s going to be fair to say that coal dust played a role,\" Stricklin said. \"We just aren\\'t in a position to say how big of a role.\" The findings bolster MSHA\\'s preliminary findings issued 10 days after the explosion that a mix of methane and coal dust were responsible for the blast. Federal law requires coal mines to coat coal dust with pulverized stone or other inert material to prevent and contain explosions. The explosion was the deadliest at a U.S. coal mine since 1970 and is now the subject of civil and criminal investigations. Mine owner Massey Energy Co. criticized MSHA for releasing the test results. \"This is not the first time MSHA has attempted to use unproven or faulty coal dust claims in their investigation efforts,\" the Richmond, Va.-based company said in a statement. A federal administrative law judge rejected citations MSHA issued for rock dust violations after a deadly explosion at an Alabama coal mine in 2001. Massey General Counsel Shane Harvey said \"it\\'s pretty important\" to note that MSHA issued citations for similar alleged rock dust violations after that accident. \"That was flatly rejected,\" Harvey said. MSHA contends that samples taken after an explosion contain less coal dust than they would have before a blast. \"The explosion has had the opportunity to eat up or use up, burn up some of the combustible materials,\" Stricklin said. Inspection logs filled out by Massey employees before the blast showed problems with coal dust as well. The Associated Press reported Sunday that those handwritten logs showed eight of the mine\\'s conveyer belts had excessive amounts of coal dust 32 minutes before the explosion at 3:02 p.m. on April 5. Harvey said the company believed the mine was properly rock dusted at the time of the explosion. The logs, which Massey turned over to investigators, also show the mine routinely had to deal with excessive coal dust along the belts. MSHA has collected 1,803 dust samples so far and 79 percent contained too little inert material to comply with the law, Stricklin said. Most of the samples came from parts of the mine affected by the explosion, with a minority taken just past the spot where seven of the victims were found. Investigators still need samples from two areas that had been flooded in the 12-mile underground complex, Stricklin said. One of those areas is now drained, which will allow investigators to enter it and begin mapping, sampling and searching for clues. Stricklin expects pumping will begin shortly in the second area. MSHA also is still searching for a methane detector that should have been at the mine\\'s main working face and a remote control for the longwall mining machine used in that area. The agency also plans to recreate the mine\\'s ventilation scheme as it would have been at the time of the blast. \"The majority of the underground work has been complete.\" On the surface, investigators have conducted 235 interviews and plan about 20 more, Stricklin said. The agency is still considering whether it needs to interview Massey Chief Executive Don Blankenship. Following the investigation, MSHA may cite Massey for violations that investigators determine contributed to the explosion and deaths. The agency also could fine the company. The criminal investigation is being handled separately by the U.S. Department of Justice. MSHA\\'s latest update came a day after Massey warned investors to brace for another quarterly loss, complaining that tougher enforcement was hurting productivity. MSHA director Joe Main reacted quickly, saying mine operators are responsible for finding and fixing hazards instead of relying on government inspectors. \"When the industry comes to grips with this issue and figures out a way to beef up their health and safety programs, there\\'s going to be less enforcement action for MSHA to take,\" Main said.',\n",
       " 'In the biggest settlement ever reached in a U.S. mining disaster, the new owners of the West Virginia coal mine where 29 men were killed in an explosion agreed Tuesday to pay $210 million over a tragedy the government blamed on the ruthless pursuit of profits ahead of safety. ADVERTISEMENT The money will go to compensate the grieving families, bankroll cutting-edge safety improvements and pay for years of violations by Massey Energy, owner of the Upper Big Branch mine at the time of the April 2010 blast. Under the deal, Alpha Natural Resources -- which bought Massey earlier this year -- will face no criminal charges in the explosion as long as it abides by the settlement, U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said. But \"no individuals are off the hook,\" Goodwin warned, adding that federal prosecutors are still investigating former Massey managers. Charges have been brought against only one person so far: the mine\\'s former security chief, Hughie Elbert Stover. A federal jury convicted him last month of lying to investigators and trying to destroy mine records. He is awaiting sentencing. The settlement was bitterly criticized by some of the dead men\\'s relatives, who said they won\\'t be satisfied until charges are filed against those they consider responsible for the catastrophe, the nation\\'s deadliest mine accident in 40 years. Gary Quarles, whose son Gary Wayne Quarles died in the disaster, said: \"I want to hear names, and I want to know what they\\'re going to be charged for. Today would have been a fine day for them to have told us.\" Hours after the settlement was announced, the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration released a final report on the blast that detailed 369 safety violations at Upper Big Branch, including 12 it said contributed to the explosion. MSHA labeled nine of the violations that led to the accident as flagrant, the most serious designation, and said they included illegally tipping off miners that inspectors were on the site and failing to conduct proper safety inspections. \"The physical conditions that led to the explosion were the result of a series of basic safety violations at UBB and were entirely preventable,\" the report said. The report confirmed what the agency and other investigators said previously: that Massey allowed a buildup of highly explosive methane gas and combustible coal dust, and that worn and broken cutting equipment created the spark that ignited the fuel. Also, investigators said broken water sprayers allowed a mere flare-up to turn into an inferno that ripped through miles of underground tunnels and killed men instantly. \"Every time Massey sent miners into the UBB Mine, Massey put those miners\\' lives at risk,\" said MSHA director Joe Main. \"Massey management created a culture of fear and intimidation in their miners to hide their reckless practices. Today\\'s report brings to light the tragic consequences of a corporate culture that values production over people.\" The settlement consists of $46.5 million in restitution to the miners\\' families, $128 million for safety improvements, research and training, and $35 million in fines for safety violations at Upper Big Branch and other Massey mines. The deal seeks to guarantee that the families of the 29 dead miners and two co-workers who survived the explosion will each receive $1.5 million. Those who accept the payout can still pursue lawsuits, but the $1.5 million will be deducted from any settlement or jury award. At least eight families of dead miners previously settled with Massey. Alpha CEO Kevin Crutchfield said the company cooperated fully with authorities and believes the agreement represents \"the best path forward for everyone.\" \"We\\'re particularly pleased that a substantial portion of the settlement is going towards furthering miner safety, which has always been Alpha\\'s guiding principle,\" he said. The deal was seen as precedent-setting, not just because of the amount of money, but because a lot of it is going toward research that could make mining safer. It was also seen as an attempt by Alpha to put the scandal behind it. \"Alpha definitely knows they had a problem. Whenever they bought Massey, they bought all of Massey\\'s older problems,\" said Bruce Dial, who runs a mine consulting company out of Pineville, N.C. \"This is their way of saying, `Massey did this, we bought Massey, let\\'s settle up and start new.\"\\' Well before the disaster, Massey had a poor safety record, and the coal company and its hard-nosed CEO, Don Blankenship, had a reputation among their union critics for treating fines as the cost of doing business. MSHA said its investigation found \"systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts\" by Massey to cover up problems, including keeping two sets of inspection books -- an accurate one for itself, and a fake one for regulators. The federal agency also said it will conduct an internal review of its own actions at Upper Big Branch. Relatives of the victims and officials with the United Mine Workers union have rebuked MSHA for not shutting down the mine before the tragedy. Under Tuesday\\'s settlement, Virginia-based Alpha will invest $48 million in a mine-safety research trust and spend an additional $80 million to improve safety at all of its mines with the latest technology. The improvements will include coating mines with crushed limestone to reduce the risk of a coal-dust explosion; using digital sensors to continuously monitor air flow and methane levels; and adopting emergency oxygen equipment, similar to what firefighters rely on, to give miners an uninterrupted supply of air while trying to escape from an underground accident. \"This in several ways is a revolutionary resolution,\" Goodwin said. \"We wanted it to be something constructive and forward-looking.\" Clay Mullins, whose brother Rex died in the mine, said he wants to see criminal charges brought against executives at Massey, not just against low- and mid-level managers. \"It was an act of murder,\" he said. \"They murdered 29 men, and I\\'m not satisfied one bit.\" Mullins said he also believes MSHA bears some responsibility. MSHA coal administrator Kevin Stricklin defended the agency, saying that his inspectors shut the mine down 48 times in the year before the blast but had to allow it to reopen when problems were fixed. He said MSHA lacked the authority to close it permanently and still does. \"We thought we were keeping accidents from happening,\" he said.',\n",
       " 'ADVERTISEMENT Date: Tuesday, March 3, 2009 Issue: Did the decision by the Chief Justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court to not recuse himself from a case involving his principal financial supporter violate the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment? Background: Brent Benjamin won his seat as the Chief Justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court in a 2004 statewide election. The man who is perhaps most responsible for Benjamin\\'s spot on the court is Don Blankenship, CEO of Massey Coal one of the largest companies in the Mountaineer State. Blankenship spent $3 million in advertisements to help Benjamin\\'s cause. That amount represents 60 percent of all money spent on behalf of the Benjamin campaign. There is no argument that the donations were legal. After the election, Blankenship\\'s company appealed an adverse $50 million judgment to the West Virginia State Supreme Court now presided by the man he help put there. Justice Benjamin refused to recuse himself from the case saying there was no conflict of interest and his ability as a jurist would not impact his ability to render a fair decision. Benjamin cast the deciding vote in Massey\\'s favor setting aside the $50 million judgment. The losing side in the dispute—a collection of smaller coal companies—contends their Due Process rights were violated by Benjamin\\'s decision to remain in the case. In its brief to the Supreme Court they argue Benjamin\\'s presence \"created a constitutionally unacceptable probability\" of bias. Lawyers for Massey Coal contend recusal is necessary only when a judge has a \"pecuniary\" interest in the outcome. Something they say is not at issue in this case. They also point out that Justice Benjamin has voted against them at least five other times in cases totaling in excess of $243 million. Earlier this year, Benjamin announced he would no longer take part in Massey Coal cases saying it would be disrespectful while the matter is before the Supreme Court. This case is seen by some interests as a prime example why judges shouldn\\'t be elected in the first place. The case also closely parallels the 2008 John Grisham book \"The Appeal.\" Date: Tuesday, March 3, 2009 Issue: This case is about the availability of relief under the Federal Arbitration Act when third parties attempt to force arbitration in federal courts. Background: After Wayne Carlisle and two associates sold their construction business they wanted help in setting up tax shelters for their profits. They eventually partnered with a firm called Bricolage who worked with other companies setting up the shelter. As part of the agreement with Bricolage, Carlisle and his business partners signed a contract providing for arbitration in case of a dispute. As it turned out, the IRS said the shelter was illegal and initially allowed Carlisle some extra time to make good on his tax obligations. But Carlisle says the firm the IRS reached out to never informed him of that grace period. Eventually the IRS cracked down on Carlisle for the failure to pay his original tax burden and added fines and interest all totaling in excess of $20 Million. Carlisle sued Bricolage and eight other interests saying they were responsible for his tax mess. The arbitration agreement with Bricolage was enacted—but only with Bricolage. The other eight firms were left to defend themselves in court. They argue they too should be covered by the arbitration agreement.',\n",

ADVERTISEMENT Jama Jarrett said the last bodies were taken out around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Tuesday and the bodies were being sent to the state medical examiner for autopsies. Recovery efforts had been stalled in previous days by volatile gases, but teams entered Monday after the tunnels were ventilated. The recovery of the remaining bodies, paves the way for federal investigators to enter the mine as they try to determine what caused the worst U.S. coal mining disaster since 1970. Investigators had not yet entered the mine early Tuesday, Jarrett said. The team of inspectors from the Mine Safety and Health Administration briefed Secretary of Labor   and MSHA director Joe Main at the Upper Big Branch mine Monday. The mine's owner, Richmond, Va.-based Massey Energy Co., has been under scrutiny for a string of safety violations at the mine, though CEO Don Blankenship has defended the company's record and disputed accusations that he puts profits ahead of safety.

Massey has been repeatedly cited and fined for problems with the system that vents methane and for allowing combustible dust to build up. New York state's comptroller and a pension fund adviser called for Blankenship's resignation immediately as chairman of Massey's board. Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, trustee of a retirement fund holding more than 300,000 shares of Massey stock worth $14 million, said the company failed to adequately manage risks at the mine. A similar challenge came in a letter to Massey from William Patterson, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based CtW Investment Group, which works with union pension funds.

       " 'Antarctica is a land of ice. But dive below the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and you\\'ll find fire as well, in the form of subglacial volcanoes. ADVERTISEMENT Now, a new study finds that these subglacial volcanoes and other geothermal \"hotspots\" are contributing to the melting of Thwaites Glacier, a   that flows into Antarctica\\'s Pine Island Bay. Areas of the glacier that sit near geologic features thought to be volcanic are melting faster than regions farther away from hotspots, said Dustin Schroeder, the study\\'s lead author and a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin. This melting could significantly affect ice loss in the West Antarctic, an area that is losing ice quickly. \"It\\'s not just the fact that there is melting water, and that water is coming out,\" Schroeder told Live Science. \"It\\'s how that affects the flow and stability of the ice.\"\\xa0 [ ] Researchers have long known that volcanoes lurk under the ice of West Antarctica. This is a seismically active region, where East and West Antarctica are rifting apart. In 2013, a team of scientists even   beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. West Antarctica is also   due to climate change, and recent studies have suggested there is no way to reverse the retreat of West Antarctic glaciers. However, the timing of this retreat is still in question, Schroeder said it could take hundreds of years, or thousands. It\\'s important to understand which, given that meltwater from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet contributes directly to sea level rise. Scientists use computer models to try to predict the future of the ice sheet, but their lack of understanding of subglacial geothermal energy has been a glaring gap in these models. Measuring geothermal activity under the ice sheet is so difficult that researchers usually just enter one, uniform estimate for the contributions of geothermal heat to melting, Schroeder said. Of course, volcanism isn\\'t uniform. Geothermal hotspots no doubt influence melting more in some areas than in others. \"It\\'s the most complex thermal environment you might imagine,\" study co-author Don Blankenship, a geophysicist at UT Austin, said in a statement. \"And then, you plop the most critical dynamically unstable ice sheet on planet Earth in the middle of this thing, and then you try to model it. It\\'s virtually impossible.\" To unravel the complexity, the researchers built on a previous study they published in 2013 that mapped out the system of channels that flows beneath the Thwaites Glacier, a fast-flowing glacier that scientists say is vulnerable to global warming. Using radar data from satellites in orbit, the researchers were able to figure out where these subglacial streams were too full to be explained by flow from upstream. The swollen streams revealed spots of unusually high melt, Schroeder said. Next, the researchers checked out the subglacial geology in the region and found that fast-melting spots were disproportionately clustered near confirmed West Antarctic volcanoes, suspected volcanoes or other presumed hotspots. \"There\\'s a pattern of hotspots,\" Schroeder said. \"One of them is next to Mount Takahe, which is a volcano that actually sticks out of the ice sheet.\" The minimum average heat flow beneath Thwaites Glacier is 114 milliwatts per square meter (or per about 10 square feet) with some areas giving off 200 milliwatts per square meter or more, the researchers report Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. (A milliwatt is one-thousandth of a watt.) In comparison, Schroeder said, the average heat flow of the rest of the continents is 65 milliwatts per square meter. \"It\\'s pretty hot by continental standards,\" he said. The extra melt caused by subglacial volcanoes could lubricate the ice sheet from beneath, hastening its flow toward the sea, Schroeder said. To understand how much the volcanic melt contributes to this flow and what that means for the future of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet glaciologists and climate scientists will have to include the new, finer-grained findings in their models. Schroeder and his colleagues also plan to expand their study to other glaciers in the region. \"Anywhere in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is going to be a candidate for high melt areas,\" he said. \"And we have radar data covering much of it.\"',\n",
       " 'The former CEO who oversaw the West Virginia mine that exploded in 2010, killing 29 people, was indicted Thursday on federal charges related to a mine safety investigation that followed the blast. ADVERTISEMENT U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said a federal grand jury indicted former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship on charges that include conspiracy to violate mandatory federal mine safety and health standards, conspiracy to impede federal mine safety officials, making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission and securities fraud. Blankenship could face up to 31 years in prison if convicted. The indictment alleges Blankenship conspired to violate mine safety and health standards at the Upper Big Branch Mine from January 2008 until April 2010, when an explosion at the mine killed 29 coal miners. Specifically, the indictment said Blankenship was part of a conspiracy to provide advance warning of federal mine safety inspections, allowing mine bosses to conceal and cover up safety violations. After the explosion, Blankenship made false statements and representations to the SEC concerning Massey Energy\\'s safety practices prior to the explosion. He made similar statements in connection with the purchase and sale of Massey Energy stock, the indictment said. Alpha Natural Resources bought Massey for $7.1 billion in June 2012. Blankenship, who retired ahead of the merger, has denied any wrongdoing Four investigations into the Upper Big Branch explosion found that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited accumulations of coal dust and methane gas.

Had I known the film was in any way associated with Don Blankenship, I would have never agreed to the interview.” The 51-minute documentary -- titled “Upper Big Branch – Never Again” -- was posted online Monday and disputes the official report on the disaster issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, which attributed the methane gas explosion to a series of safety violations by Massey. The agency also criticized the company for an alleged corporate culture that valued profits over safety. In Manchin’s cease-and-desist letter Tuesday to Virginia-based producers Adroit Films, he wrote: “Your fraudulent behavior in securing the interview and your misrepresentation of my interview are actionable offenses. I expect you to cease distribution of this film and remove any references to my name, image, and likeness.”\\xa0 The company responded Wednesday, saying in part that it neither deceived nor intended to deceive any interview subject about the film or its participants.\\xa0 \"Subjects were asked to comment on mine safety and mine disasters,\" Adroit said in a statement. \"Each signed a release to agree to be interviewed for the film which was identified in the release as being about the Upper Big Branch mine. Information about Adroit Films and its projects is on its publicly accessible website, including information about a recent project produced for Don Blankenship.\" Blankenship insists the cause of the explosion was natural gas, a theory that official investigators have rejected. The documentary includes interviews with “independent experts” who agree with his theory. It also begins with a disclaimer that the experts are \"not in association or affiliation with Don Blankenship.” Machin said he was interviewed for roughly 30 minutes for the film, which devotes only one minute and 32 seconds to mine safety. He appears twice, first talking about the importance of coal in the United States, then saying he had never heard of the natural gas explanation.',\n",

       " 'A judge is upholding most of a gag order in a criminal case against ex-Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, who was in charge of the Upper Big Branch mine when it exploded and killed 29 men. ADVERTISEMENT In an order Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Irene Berger wrote that she needs much of the gag order intact to maintain a fair trial with unbiased prospective jurors in southern West Virginia, a community where the impact of the mine disaster still reverberates. \"Many families and communities within the Southern District of this state were impacted by the deaths of the miners in the Upper Big Branch mine explosion referenced in the indictment,\" Berger wrote. \"Interest in this case is, understandably, heightened by that loss of life. In short, the environment matters.\" Berger said she will make more documents public, however, including her opinions and orders. Her decision upholding most of the gag order, for example, is now available for public view. The original indictment, which was released publicly before the gag order was issued, will also be available. Documents with information or arguments related to case facts and substance will remain sealed, and the judge is still prohibiting attorneys or relatives of victims from discussing the case with reporters or releasing restricted court documents. The Associated Press, The Charleston Gazette, The Wall Street Journal, National Public Radio and Friends of West Virginia Public Broadcasting challenged the order, asking that it be dropped or modified. Discussing the gag order in a hearing last month, attorney Sean McGinley said on behalf of the groups that the case has already been widely publicized in the news media for years. The groups have argued the prohibitions are overly broad and infringe on free-speech rights, including constitutional rights for journalists to do their jobs. They have said a jury could still be fair and impartial without the restrictions. Additionally, several family members of the mine-disaster victims have talked to the news media, despite the gag order. Berger wrote that news media publications \"could prejudice the jury selection process and/or influence the outcome of a trial, absent the Court\\'s restrictions on access to certain sources of information.\" Berger wrote that even if family members of victims aren\\'t direct witnesses, they could be witnesses at sentencing or potential beneficiaries of restitution. Blankenship is charged with conspiring to violate safety and health standards at the Upper Big Branch Mine. He also faces charges of lying to federal financial regulators about safety measures in the deadly blast. In November, Blankenship pleaded not guilty and was released on a $5 million bond. He could face up to 31 years in prison if convicted. His lawyers have said they support the gag order if the case remains in southern West Virginia. Blankenship wants the case moved out of the region.',\n",
       " 'Prosecutors are requesting the maximum penalty of a year in prison and a $250,000 fine for convicted ex-Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, who ran a West Virginia coal mine that was the site of a 2010 explosion that killed 29 men. ADVERTISEMENT In a sentencing memorandum in federal court Monday, prosecutors said the one-year cap on prison time for conspiring to shirk mine safety laws is \"woefully insufficient.\" But any shorter sentence for Blankenship could only be interpreted as a \"declaration that mine safety laws are not to be taken seriously,\" prosecutors wrote. Blankenship was convicted Dec. 3 of a misdemeanor conspiracy to willfully violate mine safety standards at Upper Big Branch Mine in southern West Virginia, where an explosion killed 29 men in 2010. In their memorandum, Blankenship\\'s attorneys say he shouldn\\'t receive more than probation and a fine. They reiterated that they intend to appeal. Blankenship\\'s sentencing is slated for April 6, the day after the sixth anniversary of the Upper Big Branch disaster. Prosecutors painted the mine as a \"calamity in the making,\" poorly ventilated and covered in black coal dust that would easily ignite. \"There was no question what accumulations of coal dust meant if not properly treated: a powder keg 1,000 feet below the surface, primed to blow at any time,\" wrote Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Ruby. At the helm of a multibillion-dollar publicly traded company, the wealthy executive had the means to run the mine safely, but was greedy enough \"to willfully imperil his workers\\' survival to further fatten his bank account,\" prosecutors wrote. \"He made a conscious, cold-blooded decision to gamble with the lives of the men and women who worked for him,\" Ruby wrote. Blankenship\\'s attorneys countered by providing dozens of positive letters from former employees, friends, family and members of the community. \"The defense never contested that Don Blankenship could be blunt and a hard taskmaster, but the truth is that he cares deeply about his family, his community, and the people who worked for him,\" wrote defense attorney Blair Brown. They pointed to his humble roots, investments in the community and mine safety initiatives. \"All these huge public improvements didn\\'t come with a big banner flying overhead that said, \\'Donated by Don Blankenship and/or Massey Energy;\\' that\\'s not how he has chosen to operate through the years,\" wrote Lisa Crum, who worked in human resources for one of Massey\\'s contractors for about 18 years. Her husband worked for a Massey-owned processing plant in Mingo County, W.Va. Prosecutors are still fighting to force Blankenship to pay $28 million in restitution to Alpha Natural Resources, a now-bankrupt coal company that bought Massey in 2011. The money would cover legal fees, investigative expenses and fines incurred by Alpha. Other claims for restitution have been submitted, prosecutors wrote. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys agree that a separate restitution hearing is necessary.',\n",

       " 'Convicted former energy company CEO Don Blankenship won\\'t have to pay a coal producer $28 million in restitution related to a mine explosion in 2010 that killed 29 men, a federal judge ruled Monday. ADVERTISEMENT In her order, Judge Irene Berger said Blankenship doesn\\'t have to pay the money to Alpha Natural Resources, which bought Massey in 2011 after the explosion. The Bristol, Virginia-based coal company filed for bankruptcy in August. The ruling was a win for Blankenship, helping him avoid a substantial blow to a personal fortune that he refused to disclose to prosecutors. \"We are pleased by the ruling. It is obviously correct,\" said William Taylor, Blankenship\\'s lead defense attorney. \"It is hard to see how Alpha could acquire Massey at a discounted price knowing of its problems and claim to be a victim in this case.\" Blankenship was convicted on Dec. 3 of a misdemeanor conspiracy to willfully violate mine safety standards at Upper Big Branch Mine in southern West Virginia. He faces a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine. He was acquitted of felonies that could have stretched his sentence to 30 years. Blankenship will be sentenced Wednesday. According to Berger\\'s order, Alpha paid $13.5 million to cooperate with the investigation into the explosion at Upper Big Branch. The company incurred $10 million in mine safety violation penalties at the mine and spent $4.3 million to represent seven former Massey officers and employees who participated in the investigation, the order said. Berger wrote that Alpha was dealt the financial hardships at least a year after Blankenship\\'s indictment period — after Alpha bought Massey in 2011 and voluntarily entered a non-prosecution agreement with the government. Alpha and the U.S. Attorney\\'s office in southern West Virginia declined to comment on the ruling. Blankenship\\'s defense also has called for Berger to dismiss 94 other claims for restitution from former Massey coal miners and family members.',\n",
       " 'Former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship was convicted Thursday on one of three counts connected to a deadly coal mine explosion and acquitted of two other charges. ADVERTISEMENT Blankenship was convicted on a misdemeanor conspiracy count but acquitted of making false statements and securities fraud. A 12-member jury returned the verdicts for the former coal industry executive in U.S. District Court in Charleston. Blankenship was tried on charges of conspiring to break safety laws and defrauding mine regulators at West Virginia\\'s Upper Big Branch Mine, and lying to financial regulators and investors about safety. The mine exploded in 2010, killing 29 men. The conviction becomes the centerpiece of a wide-spanning investigation into Massey that began after the explosion. The probe produced four other convictions up the Massey corporate chain, leading to Blankenship. Relatives of the miners who died have long called for Blankenship to go to prison. During the trial, which began Oct. 1, prosecutors contended that Blankenship was a bullish micromanager who knew about and meddled in the smallest details of Upper Big Branch. Prosecutors said Massey\\'s safety programs really were just a facade — never backed by more money to hire additional miners or take more time on safety tasks. And prosecutors consistently reminded jurors that a conspiracy doesn\\'t have to be spelled out formally between parties. \"The defendant wants you to reward him for being smart enough not to come right out and say, \\'I want you to break the law,\\'\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Ruby told jurors in closing arguments. \"He wants you to let him off the hook because he was careful enough to come right up to the line of putting it explicitly, putting it into words without doing it. Don\\'t do that.\" Blankenship\\'s defense made a rare, risky move by not calling a single witness in the case. His attorneys said there wasn\\'t a shred of evidence that Blankenship was involved in a conspiracy. \"We don\\'t convict people in this country on the basis of maybes,\" lead defense attorney William Taylor said in his closing argument. \"We don\\'t convict them of crimes because they are rich or they are rude or they are tough. We require the government to prove more than that a man was in charge of a company when a terrible tragedy occurred.\" Prosecutors made their case with Blankenship\\'s own voice, using phone calls he secretly recorded in his Massey office. In key calls, Blankenship said a scathing internal safety memo should be kept highly confidential, and that it would be a terrible document to show up in legal discovery if there was a mine fatality. Under defense cross-examination, Christopher Blanchard — who ran the subsidiary that oversaw Upper Big Branch — said Blankenship and Massey pushed for safety. Testifying to prosecutors, Blanchard said he believed Blankenship thought it was less expensive to pay fines than pay for measures to prevent safety violations. He also said most Upper Big Branch violations could have been prevented by hiring more miners or spending more time on safety tasks. Former Massey safety expert William Ross, who gave a tough review of the company\\'s safety shortcomings, wept while testifying about how thrilled he had been to think that Massey was going to change. He also became emotional while talking about a 2009 meeting with Blankenship, in which he told the executive that Massey couldn\\'t \"afford to have a disaster.\"',\n",
       " 'Former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship\\'s lawyers say his compensation and stock holdings and the testimony of a former subordinate are irrelevant to his criminal case and should be excluded from his trial. ADVERTISEMENT Evidence of Blankenship\\'s finances and testimony from David Hughart, a former president of Massey subsidiary White Buck Coal Co., would unfairly prejudice the jury, defense lawyers said in motions filed Tuesday in federal court. Hughart was sentenced in 2013 to 3½ years in prison on conspiracy charges that grew out of the criminal investigation into the 2010 Upper Big Branch explosion, which killed 29 men. He admitted his role in ensuring that miners at other Massey subsidiaries got illegal advance warning of surprise safety inspections. He also implicated Blankenship in the conspiracy during his plea hearing in 2013. \"All of the testimony from Hughart that the government seeks to admit concerns mines other than UBB. The indictment specifically states that Mr. Blankenship is charged with conspiring to willfully violate mine-safety standards and impede MSHA \\'at UBB,\\' not at any other mine,\" Blankenship\\'s lawyers wrote in one motion. Another defense motion seeks to exclude previous guilty pleas by White Buck Coal and Massey subsidiary Aracoma Coal to violating federal mine safety laws. In all, the defense filed 16 motions seeking to exclude evidence. Federal prosecutors also are seeking to exclude evidence, including Blankenship\\'s claims that company mines were safe despite what prosecutors say were routine violations of federal safety standards. \"These claims may be convenient excuses, but they are not legal defenses. They are not relevant to the charges against defendant, and they are not admissible at trial,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Ruby wrote. Other evidence that prosecutors want excluded includes Blankenship\\'s argument that federal mine safety standards were incorrect or misguided. \"If the only question in this case is whether defendant violated the criminal provisions he is charged with violating, then the answer is not complicated. He did. Mine safety laws were violated at the Upper Big Branch mine ... thousands of times — the same, readily preventable violations, over and over — with his full knowledge and under his close supervision,\" Ruby wrote.',\n",
       " 'The former CEO who oversaw the West Virginia mine that exploded in 2010, killing 29 people, was indicted Thursday on federal charges related to a mine safety investigation that followed the blast. ADVERTISEMENT U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said a federal grand jury indicted former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship on charges that include conspiracy to violate mandatory federal mine safety and health standards, conspiracy to impede federal mine safety officials, making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission and securities fraud. Blankenship could face up to 31 years in prison if convicted. The indictment alleges Blankenship conspired to violate mine safety and health standards at the Upper Big Branch Mine from January 2008 until April 2010, when an explosion at the mine killed 29 coal miners. Specifically, the indictment said Blankenship was part of a conspiracy to provide advance warning of federal mine safety inspections, allowing mine bosses to conceal and cover up safety violations. After the explosion, Blankenship made false statements and representations to the SEC concerning Massey Energy\\'s safety practices prior to the explosion. He made similar statements in connection with the purchase and sale of Massey Energy stock, the indictment said. Alpha Natural Resources bought Massey for $7.1 billion in June 2012. Blankenship, who retired ahead of the merger, has denied any wrongdoing Four investigations into the Upper Big Branch explosion found that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited accumulations of coal dust and methane gas. Broken and clogged water sprayers allowed what should have been a minor flare-up to become an inferno. The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said the root cause was Massey\\'s \"systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts\" to conceal life-threatening problems.

       " 'The surge in Democratic enthusiasm and activism driven by animosity to President Trump is proving to be a mixed blessing. Renewed fervor improves Democratic prospects in 2018 House and Senate elections. At the same time, in a development reminiscent of the Tea Party Republican insurgency of 2010, moderate and centrist Democratic incumbents face primary challengers from  the Sanders left . In some cases, these challengers raise the threat of bitterly contested midterm primaries that could leave House and Senate nominees weakened for the general election. Two moderate Senate Democrats,  Joe Manchin  of West Virginia and  Claire McCaskill  of Missouri, both face primary challenges from the insurgent progressive wing of their party, as do a  growing number  of Democratic House incumbents. Center versus left disputes within Democratic ranks have surfaced on several fronts, even as Democrats of all stripes have come to recognize the devastating costs of the Trump-era Republican attack on the  nature of truth  and the parallel rise of “alternative facts.” The Democratic National Committee, charged with a crucial organizational role in the coming presidential election, continues to struggle to regain standing with Sanders supporters after a series of conflicts in 2016 and 2017 over such matters as control of valuable donor lists and demands for a more progressive agenda. Intra-Democratic conflict resurfaced this week with the release of  anti-Sanders passages  from Hillary Clinton’s new book, “What Happened.” Clinton wrote that “attacks” Sanders made during the primary season Clinton added that Sanders “didn’t get into the race to make sure a Democrat won the White House, he got in to disrupt the Democratic Party.” In a statement on Wednesday,  Sanders countered : “My response is that right now it’s appropriate to look forward and not backward.” There is good evidence that defections by Sanders’ Democratic primary voters to Trump on Nov. 8 played a decisive role in Trump’s victory. Brian Schaffner , a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, calculated that Sanders-to-Trump voters were key to Trump’s victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The accompanying chart, which is based on the 2016 survey conducted by the  Cooperative Congressional Election Study , shows how crucial these voters were. The internal battle over how to maximize the political strength of the party reflects the fact that it is made up of a coalition of  multiple ,  sometimes overlapping, factions  with an intense desire to win, but in constant competition with one another. These factions include economic populists, led by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, along with Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown;  increasingly influential women , including Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Warren; an equally influential group of African-American politicians, including Cory Booker, Deval Patrick and Harris; Hispanics determined to gain power, including Julián and Joaquín Castro and Xavier Becerra; and a still strong but often challenged white male Democratic establishment that includes Joe Biden and Terry McAuliffe. Many of the current conflicts enlarge upon the ideological divisions that dominated the 2016 presidential primaries, with Hillary Clinton representing the centrist wing and Bernie Sanders the progressive wing. The debate going into the next election cycle raises the question of whether the Democratic Party will be most successful with continued — or enlarged — support from a segment of the white working class: 34 percent of non-college white women and 23 percent of non-college white men  voted for Clinton  in 2016. Can these numbers be maintained or improved or should Democrats look elsewhere — for more votes from minorities and deeper support from women, along with continued improvement among upscale whites — to piece together victory in 2018 or 2020? There is an argument to be made that the party has in fact already moved sharply in a  leftward direction . In a phone interview, Mark Longabaugh, a senior strategist in the Sanders campaign, cited data from the  Pew Research Center  showing that the percentage of Democrats describing themselves as “liberal” grew from 27 to 48 percent from 2000 to 2017, while self-identified Democratic moderates fell from 45 to 36 percent. Conservative Democrats dropped from 23 to 16 percent. “The party is still this wrestling about its identity,” Longabaugh said. He suggested that Democrats are stalled by what he described as “a sort of rubbernecking, watching this 15-car pileup in the Republican Party” on the other side of the road while “we are stuck in traffic, not moving forward.” Despite the continuing ideological confusion, there are a number of positive signs for the Democratic Party. In a reflection of the determination among Democratic voters to take control of the House out of the hands of Donald Trump’s Republican Party, individuals’ contributions to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have risen from  $32.4 million  in the first seven months of 2013 to  $50.2 million  in the first seven months of this year. Not only have contributions from individuals (as opposed to political action committees) to the D.C.C.C. surged, but the amount raised from individuals is triple the $15.8 million raised by the National Republican Congressional Committee through the first seven months of this year. The same cannot be said about the Democratic National Committee — battered by the anger of Sanders supporters. The D.N.C. has seen a much smaller increase in individual contributions over the same period, from  $30.7 million  to  $33.0 million . The  surge in anti-Trump activity  across the country makes the limited D.N.C. fund-raising success surprising and speaks to the gravity of the committee’s problems. Signs of the stress the Democratic Party is under are evident in the degree of institutional fracturing. Sanders has created what amounts to his own party organization,  Our Revolution , which endorses candidates — a signal to voters of Sanders’ backing and of its separation from the Democratic Party. In a revealing statement of purpose the organization declares that For candidates “inspired by the ‘political revolution,’ ” Our Revolution promises to provide Wariness, if not downright hostility, dominates relations between Our Revolution and the Democratic Party. The tensions between the two are rooted in the disclosure during the 2016 primaries that  leaders of the D.N.C . favored Clinton while privately disparaging Sanders’ bid. In February of this year, Thomas Perez, the candidate favored by the Democratic establishment, beat Keith Ellison — who was endorsed by Sanders and who has a strong following among the party’s progressive wing, as well as among its African-American constituency — in  the election  to become chairman of the D.N.C. Further compounding the conflict, Sanders has declined to share his donor lists with the Democratic Party. “We are working hard to regain trust,” Jess O’Connell, the new executive director of the D.N.C., said in a phone interview, although there appears to have been no letup in the tension between the party and the Sanders camp. In June, the Nation  conducted an interview  with Nina Turner, a former Ohio State Senator, who is now president of Our Revolution. In April 2016, Turner  had famously objected  that “brand loyalty” was causing African-American voters to support Hillary Clinton. The Nation asked: Her reply: Then: Turner’s reply: Two months later, in August, relations remained hostile. Buzzfeed reported  that in an interview, Turner described the D.N.C. as “dictatorial,” “arrogant,” “pompous,” “superficial,” “tone-deaf,” “tone-dead,” “out of line,” “insulting” and “absolutely insulting.” Turner declined my requests for an interview. But in a sense her views on the Democratic establishment are moderate compared to those voiced by groups and individuals further to the left. Two organizations that have joined forces,  Justice Democrats  and  Brand New Congress , are run by veterans of the Sanders presidential campaign including Zack Exley and Saikat Chakrabarti. Their goal: replacing “every establishment politician in Congress in 2018,” although so far they have  endorsed  10 House candidates and one Senate candidate. The two groups, which together reported receipts of $1.2 million this year, have set their sights on Manchin, in West Virginia. Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats have endorsed Manchin’s primary challenger, Paula Jean Swearengin, who  describes  herself as “a coal miner’s daughter, granddaughter, niece and stepdaughter.” In the view of Justice Democrats: CREDO Mobile , which does not endorse candidates but instead channels support to liberal groups like Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, goes a step further. It is willing to sacrifice centrist Democrats for the sake of ideological consistency. Murshed Zaheed,  CREDO’s political director ,  told The Associated Press  in March, I spoke with Zaheed by phone. He stood by his comment to The A.P. He described himself as a “die-hard Democrat” but he wants “a Democratic Party that is going to stand up to corporations and big business.” Insofar as these intraparty power struggles are fought out in primary elections, the more passionately committed the faction, the greater its advantage. Ideologically committed voters turn out in higher percentages in primaries than less ideological moderates. The Pew data cited above reveal that the Democratic Party is at a tipping point, with the percentage of  self-identified liberals  in the Democratic electorate currently at 48 percent and rising. This suggests that in the struggle for power among the competing racial, ethnic and gender constituencies, the Sanders-Warren populist wing could emerge as the dominant force in the selection of a 2020 Democratic nominee. In theory, the selection of a nominee loyal to the left-liberal wing in the 2020 general election would test the political viability of a Democratic Party that explicitly challenges corporate power — and indeed  the capitalist system itself . Victory would legitimate the arguments of the Sanders-Warren wing. In practice, such a victory would leave the party in ideological limbo. Could Sanders or one of his revolutionary offspring actually govern? Could such a politician win against a candidate other than Donald Trump? Can the leftward movement of Democratic voters find an echo among independent and moderate voters in the general electorate? These fundamental questions are very hard to answer. Trump or no Trump, they will continue to plague the Democratic Party, not just for the next two election cycles, but on into the foreseeable future.',\n",
       " 'When Devin Patrick Kelley took a Ruger AR-556 semiautomatic assault rifle to the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., last November, he brought 15 high-capacity magazines that each contained 30 bullets. How many did he empty? “All of them,” a Texas law enforcement official said at a news conference in the days after the massacre. If William B. Ruger Sr., the co-founder of the gun maker Sturm, Ruger & Company, had had his way, Mr. Kelley’s firepower might have been much diminished. In 1989, Mr. Ruger proposed a ban on high-capacity magazines, which led a smaller rival to call Sturm, Ruger “the  Benedict Arnold of the gun industry .” Mr. Ruger once said that he  was open even to waiting periods for handgun purchases . “If the truth be known, I see no real harm in the concept,” he said, but cautioned, “the trouble is, where does it end?” Mr. Ruger was certainly not a cheerleader for gun control. But considering the tide of mass shootings and gridlock on the issue of guns, his willingness to compromise is worth revisiting. Mr. Ruger, a Brooklyn-born gun designer, took an inventor’s interest in guns after his father gave him a rifle at age 12. A 1981 profile  in The New York Times  reported that he read everything he could about guns at the New York Public Library and “studied gun metallurgy, gun mechanisms, gun designs” and “came to regard the gun as a uniquely engineered tool.” He also liked to recount how he once revealed to guests at a Manhattan cocktail party what he did for a living. “When you mention you’re in the gun business, people look shocked,” he said. “They infer that you have an utter disregard for human life, which is preposterous.” He said at the time, “There’s so much hostility, so many people stimulated to violence. But to be talking about gun legislation as a cure for this is ridiculous.” His position appeared to evolve. A series of mass shootings captured headlines in the following years. Among them, an unemployed security guard named James Oliver Huberty used an Uzi semiautomatic rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol during a  1984 rampage  at a McDonald’s in California that left 21 dead and 19 wounded. In 1991, an unemployment merchant seaman, George J. Hennard,  shot 22 people dead  at a cafeteria in Killeen, Tex., and injured another 20. With momentum building for gun control, Mr. Ruger’s move was partly tactical. He and his allies wanted “to take a responsible position to head off any further restrictions that might even have banned all semiautomatic firearms,” Robert L. Wilson wrote in the book “Ruger and His Guns.” From the gun industry’s point of view, Mr. Ruger’s stance is a cautionary tale. If he aimed to forestall a ban on assault weapons, in the end, both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines were banned through a 1994 measure signed by President Bill Clinton. The ban expired in 2004. “You give people who are truly anti-gun an inch, and they’ll take a mile,” Stephen L. Sanetti, a former Ruger executive,  told The Hartford Courant  in 2013. Mr. Sanetti, who now runs the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a lobby group, declined to comment through a spokesman. In an email, Kevin B. Reid Sr., the vice president and general counsel of Sturm, Ruger, said, “As I am sure you can appreciate, Mr. Ruger died many years ago and folks who were around and worked with him directly are long gone.” “Indeed, none of the Ruger family has been involved in the day-to-day operation of the business for more than a decade,” he added. (In 2006, the family made a large  sale of its holdings back to the company .) “As such, there really isn’t anyone who can speak to his comments or views.” Gunmakers are not proposing gun control anymore. After the 2012  Sandy Hook massacre  led to the deaths of 20 first graders and six adults, Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, was a co-sponsor of legislation that would have required universal background checks. “I’m a big believer in the Second Amendment, I’m a gun owner and take my son shooting,” he said in an interview. But at the same time, he said, “I think it’s completely reasonable to make it more difficult for those who do not have a legitimate right to a firearm to obtain them.” The legislation, which was also sponsored by Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat,  failed . “You know, the N.R.A. used to be very big supporters of mine, institutionally; they are not so much anymore,” Mr. Toomey said. “I will say honestly, a vast majority of Pennsylvanians agree with my approach on background checks, so on balance, I don’t think it hurt me politically.” The N.R.A., which did not return calls for comment, has lately been pushing to compel states that do not allow  concealed carry permits  to honor permits issued by other states. It is also trying to  deregulate silencers . John Feinblatt, president of  Everytown for Gun Safety , a gun control group backed by Michael R. Bloomberg, said his group spent more money lobbying states than the federal government. Restrictions on  bump stocks , the device that makes semiautomatic weapons more like machine guns, faltered in Washington after they were used in the Las Vegas massacre. But bans have been enacted in  Massachusetts  and  New Jersey . “The way to move Congress is to show where the people stand on this issue, and you do that most effectively through state ballots and state legislation,” Mr. Feinblatt said, likening the approach to the way gay rights advocates methodically advanced marriage rights through state legislatures. Many other western democracies have far tighter gun control laws. The rate of homicides with guns in the United States is 16 times higher than it is in Germany, 6.6 times higher than it is in Canada and more than 30 times higher than in Australia or Britain, according to data collected by the  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime . Twenty-six people died in the Sutherland Springs shooting, including the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter and a pregnant woman, while another 20 were injured by a gun bearing the Ruger name. If he were alive today, America’s most outspoken gun maker would likely have had something to say.',\n",
       " 'For decades, The Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia has exposed corruption, greed and incompetence with a tenacity that was rewarded last year with journalism’s highest honor, a Pulitzer Prize. But the newspaper now faces a painful reality: No matter how strong its journalism, no publication is immune to the economic pressure on the industry. On Monday, staff members learned that the newspaper was filing for bankruptcy ahead of a sale, ending the Chilton family’s century-long role in shepherding its journalism. A prospective buyer is lined up, but the move raises questions about the future both of a relentless local watchdog and its more than 200 employees, including Eric Eyre, who accepted  the Pulitzer last year for his reporting  on the state’s opioid crisis. “Never in a million years would I think that eight months later we would be in bankruptcy and I’d be reapplying for my job,” said Mr. Eyre, who plans to remain in West Virginia no matter the outcome. “But I guess life is full of highs and lows, and obviously now we’re at a low.” The announcement came at the end of a tumultuous period for the publication, which had weathered drawn-out legal battles stemming from a 2004 transaction in which the left-leaning Charleston Gazette acquired a controlling interest in the right-leaning Charleston Daily Mail. The newspaper — which has about 32,000 daily subscribers, according to a court filing — has also suffered circulation and advertising losses over the past decade that its publisher, Susan Chilton Shumate, described in a letter on Monday addressed to the staff as “devastating to the bottom line.” The Gazette-Mail is not alone. At The East Bay Times, which won the Pulitzer last year for breaking news coverage of a warehouse fire that killed 36 people in Oakland, Calif., several employees  have  taken  buyouts , with further layoffs pending. The industry as a whole has undergone tremendous downsizing and consolidation in recent years. That trend has hit publications in West Virginia, too, though they have been somewhat buffered by a hunger for local news. “There has been a decline of advertising revenues and not necessarily something to come along to replace that, but because so much of the state is covered by small community newspapers, I think the economic impacts haven’t been as severe,” said Maryanne Reed, dean of the West Virginia University Reed College of Media. The Gazette-Mail has long stood out among them, developing a reputation for critical coverage of politicians and industry alike, fueled by an unofficial mantra of “sustained outrage,” a favored phrase of its liberal former publisher, William E. “Ned” Chilton III. The paper exposed corruption under multiple governors, one of whom, Arch A. Moore Jr., refused to call it by its name,  addressing the publication  only as “the morning sick call.” (Governor Moore, a Republican, later  spent  time in prison  after admitting to accepting illegal campaign contributions.) The paper also has a long history of rigorously reporting on the coal industry. After  the recent death of  Paul Nyden , a longtime investigative reporter who had exposed dangerous and dishonest practices in the industry, Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, was unequivocal  about his impact . “West Virginia is safer for our coal miners and healthier for our communities because of Paul’s work,”  he said in a statement . That penetrating reporting has continued under Ken Ward, Jr.,  considered by some  to be among the nation’s best coal reporters. His impact was on display this week at a coal conference when a lawyer joked about his absence, holding up a pink piece of paper with Mr. Ward’s name on it to laughter from the crowd, according to a reporter in attendance. “That was kind of his icebreaker,” said the reporter, Taylor Kuykendall, who covers the coal industry for S&P Global Market Intelligence and has closely followed Mr. Ward’s work out of necessity. The newspaper’s doggedness was recognized last year with the Pulitzer that Mr. Eyre won for exposing drug companies that had flooded West Virginia with painkillers while flouting state law. His  reporting about a small-town pharmacy  that received nearly nine million hydrocodone pills over two years was cited by several members of Congress last year when the House Energy and Commerce Committee  opened an investigation  into the practice. Despite its successes, the financial strains on the newspaper have long been in plain view, even to outsiders. “When you see one person who used to have one beat that’s stretched into three or four, you realize that the sun’s not going to shine for long,” said Mayor Danny Jones of Charleston, who expressed concern about what the sale might mean for the crucial local institution. Even though he has spent much of his life as a Republican, Mr. Jones, now an independent, was first encouraged to run for office years ago by the liberal Mr. Chilton, he said. But that never stopped the newspaper from holding him to account. “They’ve been on me,” he said. “That’s just the way it works.” The Gazette acquired its rival, the conservative Daily Mail, in 2004, maintaining separate newsrooms. But  the Justice Department sued  in 2007, arguing that the transaction violated federal antitrust law. The combined company settled in 2010, but its legal troubles continued. In August, it was ordered to pay the former owner of The Daily Mail nearly $4 million, a decision upheld by a federal judge  less than two weeks before  its bankruptcy filing. Ogden Newspapers Inc., a national newspaper chain with roots in West Virginia, is in line to buy the paper, though there is still time for other bidders to emerge. “The Gazette-Mail is an important institution to Charleston and all of West Virginia,” Robert Nutting, president and chief executive of the company,  told one of the chain’s newspapers . “I believe that it can, and must, have a bright future.” Still, the newspaper’s staff isn’t sure what to make of the sale or what it will mean for their jobs, Mr. Eyre said. But that hasn’t stopped them from doing what they know best. “The news goes on, and we’re there to cover it,” he said.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — With the fate of hundreds of thousands of young, undocumented immigrants in the balance, the Senate on Monday began an open-ended debate on immigration — an exceedingly rare step that, in effect, will allow senators to attempt to build a bill from scratch on the Senate floor. The highly unusual debate, expected to unfold throughout the week, will test whether a series of legislative concepts and proposals championed by President Trump and a variety of Republicans and Democrats can garner 60 votes, the threshold for a measure to pass the Senate. No one has any idea how it will turn out. “Whoever gets to 60 wins,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, told reporters last week. “And it will be an opportunity for 1,000 flowers to bloom.” The debate kicked off Monday evening with a procedural vote on an unrelated House-passed measure that will serve as a shell for building an immigration bill. By a vote of 97 to 1, with only Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, dissenting, senators took the first step toward consideration of the underlying measure, as expected. The push on immigration comes against the backdrop of a ticking clock, and months of congressional inaction. About 700,000 young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children are shielded from deportation under an  Obama-era initiative known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA . Another 1.1 million young immigrants are eligible for DACA but did not apply. But  Mr. Trump suspended the initiative in September and   gave lawmakers until March 5 to come up with a replacement  that would protect the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, after proposed legislation called the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors, or DREAM Act. Liberal interest groups and immigration rights activists have mobilized to insist on  legal status for the Dreamers without the concessions demanded by the president and immigration hard-liners : billions for a wall on the Mexican border, an even more aggressive crackdown on illegal immigrants and dramatic changes to the legal immigration system that would favor skilled immigrants over the family members of citizens and green-card holders. “As the Senate is poised to start debate on the humanitarian crisis Donald Trump caused when he cruelly ended DACA, here’s what every sitting Senator should remember: Americans want the Dream Act — not cruel deals that go against basic American values,” said Corinne Ball, campaign director for MoveOn.org, a liberal activist group. Conservatives and anti-immigration groups are just as vociferous. “It was President Obama who created a cruel situation by making promises to a group of illegal aliens who he had no authority to promise what he gave them,” said Rosemary Jenks, the director of government relations for NumbersUSA, a group that advocates limiting immigration. “President Trump had a duty to rescind that policy, because the Constitution makes very clear that Congress, not the White House, sets the laws in this land.” In such a polarized environment, there is a significant chance that the Senate will pass nothing by the end of the week — or that whatever measure the Senate does adopt will be thwarted by the House. “We’re going to have something in the Senate that we haven’t had in a while,”  Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona , said Sunday on the NBC program “Meet the Press.” “It’s a real debate on an issue where we really don’t know what the outcome is going to be.” Immigration is one of the most emotional, contentious issues in Washington. The last time Congress seriously considered immigration legislation was in 2013, when the  Senate passed  a comprehensive immigration overhaul with 68 votes. But that measure, which offered a path to citizenship for about 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally — including the Dreamers — was never taken up by the House. Mr. Trump’s election, on a wave of anti-immigrant fervor, has made the current negotiations even more difficult, senators say. The negotiations are complicated by Republicans’ demands to pair any protection for DACA recipients with an increase in border security, and limits on legal immigration, and by conflicting pronouncements from Mr. Trump. After telling lawmakers  last month  that he would sign whatever they sent him, Mr. Trump now insists that any proposal address what the White House is calling “four pillars”: protection for DACA recipients; an end to what Mr. Trump calls “chain migration,” in which legal immigrants can sponsor their family members; an end to the diversity visa lottery, which is aimed at bringing in immigrants from underrepresented countries; and full funding for the proposed border wall, estimated to cost $25 billion over 10 years. The White House recently put forth its own proposal that meets those conditions; it would offer 1.8 million Dreamers a path to citizenship, in exchange for strict limits on legal immigration and the full $25 billion for the border wall. A number of Republican senators, led by Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, have drafted legislation that mirrors the White House plan, which will almost certainly be introduced as an amendment. Mr. McConnell said on Monday that he supported it. The American people have “heard many of my colleagues across the aisle insist this issue requires swift action,” Mr. McConnell said. “Now is the time to back up the talk with the hard work of finding a workable solution. That means finding an agreement that can pass the Senate, pass the House and which the president will sign — not just making a point.” Several other proposals are floating around Capitol Hill, but so far none has garnered the backing of the White House.  A bipartisan group  calling itself the Common Sense C oalition,  led by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, has been working on its own measure but has not released a plan. That group is focused on a narrower bill than the president would like, one that would pair a path to citizenship for the Dreamers with funding for the border wall. “The only way to achieve a solution to the DACA crisis is to keep it simple,” Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a member of the coalition, said on the Senate floor Monday. But Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, said he could not support a bill that addresses only DACA and border security. “The president’s indicated he would not sign such a bill, so that really doesn’t meet my definition of success,” he said. At the same time, the idea of an open-ended debate is so novel that many newer senators say they have never experienced one, and are scurrying to learn the rules. “For a lot of us, we’re going to have to learn this process,” said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, who was elected in 2014. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, marveled, “Been here seven years — I’ve never seen anything like it.” Immigrant rights groups are nervous, and do not know quite what to expect. Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, an immigrant rights group, put it this way: “This is going to be an uncertain, wild week.”',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON —  A group of senators reached a bipartisan agreement Wednesday aimed at balancing Democrats\\' fight to offer citizenship to young \"Dreamer\" immigrants with President Donald Trump\\'s demands for billions to build his coveted border wall with Mexico. Though the compromise was announced by 16 senators with centrist views on the issue and was winning support from many Democrats, it faced an uncertain fate. Leaders were trying to schedule votes on that plan and three other immigration proposals for Thursday, which they hoped would bring the chamber\\'s showdown over the hot-button issue to a close. While not specifically mentioning the bipartisan pact, Trump urged lawmakers to oppose any plan that doesn\\'t meet his more stringent demands, which include curbs on legal immigration and the abolition of a visa lottery. The Senate\\'s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, warned that lawmakers need to address Trump\\'s entire proposal, saying, \"We need to take the president seriously.\" There were also qualms among Democrats. The party\\'s No. 2 Senate leader, Richard Durbin of Illinois, said some Democrats had \"serious issues\" with parts of the plan. Those concerns focused on its spending for Trump\\'s wall and its bar against Dreamers sponsoring their parents for legal residency. \"We\\'re not there yet,\" Durbin said of the 60 votes the proposal would need for approval. So far, no other proposals from either side seem able to do that. Republicans control the chamber 51-49, though Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has missed the last several weeks while battling cancer. The bipartisan measure\\'s sponsors included eight GOP senators. That meant just three more Republicans would be needed for it to prevail if it is backed by all 47 Democrats and the two independents who usually support them. The compromise emerged as senators spent a third day of debate largely as they spent the first two — with the chamber floor mostly empty. Other than an initial roll call allowing formal debate to begin, there have been no other votes while party leaders talk behind the scenes about scheduling votes on specific proposals. The centrist proposal was produced by a group led by Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that spent weeks seeking middle ground. It would grant a 10- to 12-year route to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers, participants said. That\\'s the same number Trump has suggested helping with his own wider-ranging but more restrictive proposal. Dreamers are young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and still have no permanent protection from deportation. The plan would provide $25 billion over a decade, $2.5 billion annually, for a wall and other border security measures, the same total Trump has requested. It would bar Dreamers from sponsoring their parents for citizenship, far narrower than Trump\\'s proposal to prevent all legal immigrants from bringing parents and siblings to the U.S. The moderates\\' measure does not alter a lottery that distributes about 55,000 visas annually to people from diverse countries. Trump has proposed ending it and redistributing its visas to other immigrants, including some who are admitted based on job skills, not family ties. \"The diversity lottery is kind of toxic politically because of some of the things said by the president,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,  a reference to a vulgar description Trump used for African countries during a discussion of immigration. The White House issued a written statement by Trump urging senators to back his bill and \"oppose any legislation that fails to fulfill\" his demands. But the statement did not say Trump would veto a bill that fell short of them. A GOP measure tracking Trump\\'s proposal and backed by McConnell has been introduced and was expected to receive a vote. Few expect it to attract 60 votes, but Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he believed the bipartisan proposal could. If that happens, Rounds said, \"We\\'ll allow the president to determine whether or not it moves in the direction that he wants.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., indirectly embraced the bipartisan plan, saying, \"Each side has had to give a great deal, but we are closer than we have ever been to passing something in the Senate to help the Dreamers.\" Also in play is a more modest plan by McCain and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. It would let many Dreamers qualify for permanent residency and direct federal agencies to more effectively control the border by 2020. But it doesn\\'t offer a special citizenship pathway for Dreamers, raise border security funds or make sweeping changes in legal immigration rules. The White House said it opposes the McCain-Coons plan, saying it would \"increase illegal immigration\" and cause other problems. Another vote will be taken on a proposal by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would add language blocking federal grants to \"sanctuary cities,\" communities that don\\'t cooperate with federal efforts to enforce immigration laws. The amendment is considered sure to lose. ___ Associated Press writer Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON —  The Senate left hundreds of thousands of \"Dreamer\" immigrants in limbo Thursday, rejecting rival plans that would have spared them from deportation and strengthened the nation\\'s border security. Senators dealt President Donald Trump an especially galling defeat as more than a quarter of fellow Republicans abandoned him on an issue that helped propel him to the White House. Also defeated was a plan by a bipartisan group of senators who offered a compromise that would have shielded the young immigrants and financed Trump\\'s demands for money to build his coveted border wall with Mexico, though more gradually than he wants. Eight Republicans joined most Democrats in backing that plan, but it fell short after the White House threatened a veto and GOP leaders opposed it. The day\\'s votes, in which four separate proposals were defeated, illustrated anew Congress\\' steep challenge in striking a deal on an issue that\\'s proven intractable for years and on which each party\\'s most fervent supporters refuse to budge. The outcome suggested there may be no permanent solution soon to help the Dreamers, who were brought to the U.S. as children, despite their sky-high support in public polling. The Senate votes left the young immigrants facing a March 5 deadline that Trump has given Congress for restoring the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, that he annulled last year. Federal courts have blocked him temporarily from dismantling the Obama-era initiative, but without congressional action the immigrants will face growing risks of deportation as their protections expire. \"Dreamers\" are immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and now risk deportation because they lack permanent authorization to stay. DACA gives them the ability to live and work in the U.S. for two-year periods that can be renewed. \"It looks like demagogues on the left and the right win again on immigration,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who helped craft the bipartisan package but also backed Trump\\'s plan. He added, \"The only way forward is for President Trump to grab the reins and lead us to a solution.\" That scenario wasn\\'t in sight Thursday. The White House trashed the bipartisan proposal as \"dangerous policy that will harm the nation,\" denouncing a provision directing the government to prioritize enforcement efforts against immigrants who arrive illegally — beginning in July. Trump proved unwilling to fold on his demands for a tougher bill, reflecting the hard-line immigration stance that fueled his presidential run. After the Senate rejected all four proposals on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blamed Democrats for failing to accept what he said was a \"generous\" offer from Trump. \"They turned away from a golden opportunity to solve the issue,\" said McConnell. He expressed openness to considering a future compromise but said, \"For that to happen, Democrats will need to take a second look\" at Trump\\'s demands. Trump had dangled a chance for citizenship for 1.8 million young immigrants, meeting a top Democratic demand. But that plan also included $25 billion to build his border wall with Mexico and enact other border security measures, tighter curbs on relatives whom legal immigrants could sponsor for citizenship and an end to a visa lottery that encourages immigration from diverse nations. No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Cornyn of Texas said after the votes that lawmakers might consider temporarily protecting Dreamers from deportation in a government-wide spending measure Congress will consider next month. He said that approach \"to me is not great, but that\\'s kind of where we are.\" Democrats said Trump was the major hindrance to a broader deal. \"This vote is proof that President Trump\\'s plan will never become law,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \"If he would stop torpedoing bipartisan efforts, a good bill would pass.\" The Senate derailed Trump\\'s proposal by voting 60-39 against it — 21 votes shy of the 60 it needed to survive. The White House reacted angrily Thursday night, releasing a statement accusing \"Schumer Democrats\" of not being serious about DACA, immigration reform or homeland security. And yet, 14 Republicans — more than 1 in 4 — joined 46 Democrats in opposition. The \"no\" votes included some of the chamber\\'s most conservative Republicans, many of whom were uncomfortable with offering citizenship to immigrants here illegally. Just three Democrats backed Trump\\'s proposal, all of them facing dicey November re-election in states he carried easily in 2016: Indiana\\'s Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and West Virginia\\'s Joe Manchin. The vote on the bipartisan plan was 54-45, six short of the required 60. Eight Republicans who helped craft that compromise supported it, and three Democrats voted \"no\" including Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who\\'s viewed as a 2020 presidential hopeful. That proposal offered the citizenship pathway for Dreamers and $25 billion for border security, but doled it out over 10 years. Trump\\'s bill would have prevented legal immigrants from sponsoring parents and siblings for citizenship and would have ended a visa lottery aimed at allowing more diverse immigrants into the U.S. The compromise bill would have left the lottery system intact but barred Dreamers who obtain citizenship from sponsoring their parents. The bipartisan measure\\'s sponsors included eight GOP senators. It was produced by a group led by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Manchin. Also rejected was a modest plan by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Chris Coons, D-Del. It would have let many Dreamers qualify for permanent residency and directed federal agencies to more effectively control the border by 2020. But it didn\\'t offer a special citizenship pathway, raise border security funds or make sweeping changes in legal immigration rules. A proposal by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was killed that would have blocked federal grants to \"sanctuary cities,\" communities that don\\'t cooperate with federal efforts to enforce immigration laws. ___ Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor and Ken Thomas contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell said in an interview on Friday afternoon that President Trump should rally behind the Senate candidacy of Mitt Romney despite his blistering criticism in 2016, arguing that Mr. Romney’s potent bid was an illustration of the Republican Party’s improving fortunes entering a challenging midterm campaign. “I can’t imagine that he’s not,” Mr. McConnell said when asked whether Mr. Trump was comfortable with Mr. Romney, who on Friday  made official his long-expected candidacy  for a Senate seat from Utah. “We don’t want to lose the seat, and this looks like a pretty formidable candidate.” Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, said that Mr. Romney would enter the Senate with a stature similar to what Hillary Clinton brought as a junior senator. “The best way to think about that, and I told him this a couple of months ago, I said: ‘You’ll be a freshman like Hillary Clinton was,’” Mr. McConnell recalled. “He will come in here with a level of national identity and respect that will make him effective from Day 1.” His glowing appraisal stood in contrast to that of the White House, which  aggressively lobbied Senator Orrin G. Hatch , the veteran lawmaker who currently holds the Utah seat, to seek an eighth term in large part to block Mr. Romney’s path. Some close to Mr. Trump worry about giving Mr. Romney a platform from which he could run for president again, and Mr. Romney said in remarks Friday night to Utah Republicans that he would not shy away from taking on the president if necessary. “I’m not always with the president on what he might say or do, and if that happens, I’ll call them like I see them, the way I have in the past,” Mr. Romney said at a party dinner in Provo, adding that he largely supports Mr. Trump’s domestic agenda and could work with the White House. While enthusiastic about the handful of Senate candidates, including Mr. Romney, he has helped recruit, Mr. McConnell offered a sober assessment of what the party faces in the first midterm election of Mr. Trump’s unpopular presidency. “The odds are that we will lose seats in the House and the Senate,” Mr. McConnell said in the 30-minute interview in his Capitol office, adding: “History tells you that, the fired-up nature of the political left tells you that. We go into this cleareyed that this is going to be quite a challenging election.” But Republicans have a significant structural advantage as they try to protect  their one-seat majority  in November: They  are defending  just eight seats, while Democrats have to protect 26, including those of two independents who caucus with them. Of the seats Democrats are trying to retain, 10 are in states that Mr. Trump carried in 2016. And after struggling to woo top-tier candidates in some states, Republicans are starting to find more success as they receive a lift from  the tax overhaul  they passed in December. In addition to Mr. Romney, Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, after heavy lobbying by Mr. McConnell and Mr. Trump, reversed himself and said on Friday that he would challenge Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat seeking re-election in a state that the president won by 36 points. Advisers to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, in an indication that he intends to challenge Senator Bill Nelson, a third-term Democrat, have moved to set up a “super PAC,” according to two Republican officials. And Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, after  saying he would not run again  and  ridiculing Mr. Trump , indicated this past week that  he may not retire after all . Mr. Corker’s public misgivings, however, have complicated the Tennessee race, where Representative Marsha Blackburn, a staunch conservative, was already lining up support, and where Democrats landed a formidable candidate, former Gov. Phil Bredesen. Mr. McConnell, who  is close to Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , an ally of Mr. Corker, was guarded in his comments about the election, but he chuckled when pressed on the incumbent’s apparent change of heart. “It does underscore that people want to be in the Senate,” he said, trying to make the best of what could become a messy primary contest. “And that’s a different environment from late summer, early fall,” when the Republicans were stung by  their failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act . Equally delicate is the fate of Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who at 80 has had a series of health problems and whose seat is being eyed by a hard-line state senator, Chris McDaniel, who nearly beat him in a bitter 2014 primary race. Mr. McConnell called it “premature” to assess the prospect of a special election this year to replace Mr. Cochran, but did acknowledge that “there could be” one. “It’s up to Senator Cochran to make that decision,” he said. Privately, though, Republicans are already scrambling to protect Mr. Cochran’s seat. Party leaders fear that a candidacy by Mr. McDaniel could create a competitive race, and perhaps even spiral into a debacle similar to what happened in Alabama last year, when  Roy S. Moore’s loss  gave the state’s Democrats their first Senate election victory in 25 years. Visiting the White House this past week to help promote Mr. Trump’s infrastructure proposal, Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi found himself buttonholed by the president, who, citing the Moore disaster, said that Mr. Bryant should appoint himself to Mr. Cochran’s seat should it become vacant, according to a Republican official briefed on the conversation. Mr. McConnell has also privately encouraged Mr. Bryant to take the seat if it becomes available, but the governor has so far resisted the entreaties. Republicans close to Mr. Cochran, who is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, say that while he is not ruling out stepping down this year, he will not contemplate quitting until Congress finishes its 2018 spending bill next month. More broadly, Mr. McConnell said he was open to intervening in some party primary contests, as he did in the Tea Party era, but would do so on a state-by-state basis. He made clear he was supporting  Representative Martha McSally of Arizona , who is running against a pair of immigration hawks  to replace Senator Jeff Flake . And he said he did not want to see Don Blankenship, the former coal mine owner  imprisoned for violating federal mine safety standards , become the party’s standard-bearer against Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia. Mr. McConnell harshly criticized a series of red-state Democrats, but took repeated aim at Mr. Manchin, with whom he has tangled in the past and is plainly eager to beat in a state that has otherwise embraced the Republican Party. “Joe thinks he can just kind of talk his way through all of this, but talk is really cheap when your record doesn’t meet the rhetoric,” Mr. McConnell said, noting Mr. Manchin’s opposition to a series of Republican measures, including the tax bill. Mr. McConnell acknowledged that some of his candidates were struggling to raise money — “I concede the fund-raising problem,” he said. But he said it was largely the result of having to face so many incumbents, who are typically better able to draw donors. Still, he said that a Supreme Court case, scheduled to be argued on Feb. 26, that is expected to curb the ability of public sector unions to automatically deduct dues from their members could have an impact on Democratic fund-raising. He called the case “an example” of why he had found it so important to block former President Barack Obama from replacing Antonin Scalia on the court  after his death in 2016 , a move that Democrats remain bitter about. And, without being prompted, Mr. McConnell said he hoped that the court would broadly address what he described as the left’s effort to outlaw gerrymandering. “What do you think the founding fathers had in mind when they gave it to the state legislatures?” he said of redistricting powers. “They thought it was going to be a political exercise.” While eager to trumpet the tax measure, Mr. McConnell said that “the single best thing we’ve done, in conjunction with the administration, are the court appointments,” including that of  Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court . And even though he and Mr. Trump  heatedly clashed  over the summer, Mr. McConnell said he had “no complaint” about the president today. Mr. Trump’s re-election, however, will not be Mr. McConnell’s top priority in 2020: The famously competitive senator, who will be 78 at that point, revealed that he is fully committed to running for re-election and chided this reporter for not assuming as much.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders struggled on Friday to find a path forward on legislation to protect hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers after the Senate’s efforts collapsed into a partisan morass. Immigrant rights advocates, losing faith in the legislative process, nervously turned their attention to the courts. On Capitol Hill, both Democrats and Republicans said the future of the Dreamers — young undocumented immigrants who were brought here as children — may not be settled anytime soon. With Congress gone for a weeklong recess, there is no immediate opportunity for lawmakers to regroup after Thursday’s defeat of three Senate bills, including one backed by President Trump. In the House, Republican leaders are trying to corral support for legislation that takes an even harder line than a White House-backed bill in the Senate,  which got only 39 votes  on Thursday . But the House measure does not yet have enough support to pass, and even if it does, it will almost certainly be dead on arrival in the Senate. In the Senate, some lawmakers — including Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican — have raised the possibility of pairing a simple provision protecting the Dreamers from deportation with funding for the president’s proposed wall at the southern border with Mexico, and slipping that package into a large spending bill that must pass in late March. “The clock is still ticking,” Mr. Cornyn said. “We kind of had test votes here. We kind of know what the tolerance is for different ideas.” Meanwhile, a March 5 deadline looms. That is the day that the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, is set to expire. The program protects about 690,000 Dreamers from deportation and allows them to work, study or join the military.  But Mr. Trump rescinded DACA , leaving it to Congress to find a replacement. “I don’t know what the way forward is,” said  Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona , who has for years advocated an overhaul of the United States’ immigration laws. The uncertain outlook in Congress is matched by uncertainty in the courts. Two federal courts have blocked the Trump administration from ending DACA, but the Trump administration is seeking to have those court rulings overturned. On Friday, the Supreme Court convened a closed-door conference to consider whether to bypass appellate courts and take up the issue immediately. If that happens, legal experts say, the administration will almost certainly prevail. “Let’s not kid ourselves, it’s looking increasingly grim,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, an immigrant rights group. For his part on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to blame Democrats for the morass,  although 14 Republicans voted against his plan  on Thursday. Immigration has long been one of the most intractable issues in Washington. The Senate Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, had set aside this week for what was supposed to have been a freewheeling debate that would allow senators to build a bipartisan immigration bill from scratch. Instead, the debate devolved into the usual partisan bickering. The White House worked aggressively to defeat  a measure backed by the Common Sense Coalition, a bipartisan group of centrists . Their measure would have offered the Dreamers a path to citizenship, while committing $25 billion for border security, including the president’s proposed wall, over a 10-year period. It fell six votes short of the 60 needed to advance in the Senate. “We still have time,” Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia and a chairman of the coalition. “I think that the people are totally committed to it are going to want to get back together.” But even if the group does get back together, it will almost certainly run into trouble coming up with an immigration plan that will meet Mr. Trump’s conditions. The president wants to severely limit family-based migration and cancel the diversity visa lottery, which aims to bring in immigrants from underrepresented countries. Republicans and Democrats agree that there is now a very slim chance that legislation will pass offering citizenship to the Dreamers. With the Senate debate over, the White House is backing the House measure, which proposes a more far-reaching rewrite of immigration laws than even the president considered. The House bill would require employers to use an Internet-based system, known as E-Verify, to confirm that they are hiring only legal workers; crack down on so-called sanctuary cities by denying them federal grants; allow for the detention of minors who are arrested at the border with their parents; and toughen sentences for criminals who return illegally after being deported. The measure would end the diversity visa lottery program, as Mr. Trump wants, and end family-based migration for all relatives other than spouses and minor children. It would offer three-year renewable work permits to DACA recipients, without offering them a path to citizenship. In the Senate, Mr. Flake is trying to gather support for a measure that would simply extend DACA by three years, without offering a path to citizenship, in exchange for three years of border-wall funding. Such a bill could be attached to the spending measure that must pass by March 23, when funding for the government runs out. Democrats might not agree to wall funding without a path to citizenship for the Dreamers. And even Mr. Flake did not sound enthusiastic about that prospect. “This is a failure of Congress to act responsibly here,” he said. The negotiations over the spending bill, which would keep the government open until the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year, will play out in the next few weeks. But a continued impasse over immigration could again raise the threat of yet another government shutdown, on top of the two brief closures that have already occurred this year. Once again, Democratic votes will be needed to pass the spending bill, since 60 votes are required in the Senate, where Republicans hold only 51 seats, and numerous fiscally conservative Republicans are very likely to vote against it in the House. Lawmakers were already on a collision course over immigration as part of the negotiations of a long-term spending bill. Both the House and Senate plans for funding the Department of Homeland Security for the current fiscal year would provide $1.6 billion for physical barriers along the southern border with Mexico. The wall funding is a probable flash point between the two parties, as Democrats are loath to grant Mr. Trump his wish of building it. If Congress were to approve a spending bill without wall funding, Mr. Trump could veto it. The president has already shown an appetite for such a confrontation, saying this month that he would “love to see a shutdown” if his demands on immigration are not met.',\n",
       " \"This may be the fourth-largest metropolis in the United States, but it is much less well known to most Americans than the big three, Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. It is a steaming, hyper-air-conditioned, boom-bust-boom town that oozes across 500 relentlessly flat, bayou-laced square miles, the most ethnically and racially diverse, most unionized city in all of Texas, with aching disparities between rich and poor matched in few other places in the country. It is the city that oil built. Houston was nothing much until the first gusher came in; that was Spindletop, on the Gulf coast, which blasted Houston and Texas and the whole blessed world into the era of petroleum on Jan. 10, 1901. Since then, Houston has been a city of flamboyant oilmen like Glenn McCarthy and Hugh Roy Cullen, a city of big gestures and big spenders and bigger hair, where minimalism is a dirty word and nobody would dream of dressing down. It is the city a whole generation remembers for a single radio transmission in 1969, from an astronaut on the moon to the NASA installation southeast of town: ''Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.'' It is the city that gave birth, with Judge Roy Hofheinz's Astrodome, to the startling idea that baseball and football could be played indoors -- and, of course, to that emerald-green apotheosis of artifice, Astroturf. It is a city much more Southern than Western, green and not brown, full of magnolias, live oaks and Spanish moss. The cactus and the tumbleweeds are stored farther west (though Houston's rodeo, on now, is the nation's biggest). It is a city that has lent major political figures to the nation. People like Jesse H. Jones, who spearheaded the building of the Houston Ship Channel that made Houston a great port, who owned big chunks of the Texas Commerce Bank and The Houston Chronicle, whom Franklin D. Roosevelt summoned to Washington to run the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which he did so arrogantly that F.D.R. called him ''Jesus H. Jones.'' Men like Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and George Bush, the 41st President. Women like Oveta Culp Hobby, the wartime head of the WAC, and the eloquent Barbara Jordan. Lawyers from elite firms like John B. Connally of Vinson & Elkins and James A. Baker 3d of Baker & Botts, who held no fewer than four Cabinet-level positions. It is an ugly, sprawling city, unprotected by zoning laws. Block after barren block of weed-infested parking lots and disintegrating houses stand close by upscale shopping centers and lushly landscaped residential Edens like River Oaks. Too many hours are spent in cars on the congested but indispensable freeways. Yet in its way, it is also a city of art and culture, of exciting museums and distinguished buildings and world-class performing arts organizations. When J. B. Priestley, the English writer, visited Houston in the 1950's, somebody told him it was ''strictly a whisky and trombone town.'' That was before the gentling hand of Dominique de Menil took hold. Mrs. de Menil, who died last December at 89, used her large fortune, which came from oil-well technology, to advance the cause of the arts in Houston. Her monuments are a series of buildings in the modestly bohemian section of town called Montrose -- the Rothko Chapel, a nondenominational building housing 14 somber canvases by Mark Rothko, with a Barnett Newman sculpture called ''Broken Obelisk'' nearby; the Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum, one block to the south, built to house a series of 13th-century wall paintings from a votive chapel in Cyprus, and the Menil Collection, a private museum on the scale of the Frick Collection in New York and the Wallace Collection in London. The Menil Collection is housed in one of the best museum buildings erected since World War II -- a gray clapboard structure, low-built like the neighborhood surrounding it, with noise-absorbing wooden floors and a clever system of S-shaped light baffles. It is the work of Renzo Piano, co-architect of the Pompidou Center in Paris. Mrs. de Menil (pronounced men-EEL) had a famous eye, and the museum's rooms are filled with stunning objects, ranging from a sixth-century Coptic funeral stele depicting a wide-eyed woman, to exquisite Chi-Wara antelope sculptures from Mali in West Africa, to icons from Novgorod and Venice and Turkey, to 20th-century Surrealist paintings. There is not a clunker in sight. All seems serene, but Texas is a land of surprises. The museum is currently playing host (along with the Museum of Fine Arts and the Contemporary Arts Museum) to the Robert Rauschenberg retrospective first shown at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. No sooner had it opened, with the 72-year-old artist, a native of nearby Port Arthur, in attendance, than constables swooped in and hauled away 15 works from his personal collection, to satisfy a $5.5 million judgment against him in a lawsuit brought by a disgruntled Austin art dealer. [The paintings have since been returned to the museum.] The Contemporary Arts Museum, which has no permanent collection, and the Museum of Fine Arts, which does, are a few blocks away, so the whole show can be seen with relatively little difficulty. The M.F.A., as the locals call it, has a good collection of Impressionist and modern paintings, highlighted by superior pictures by ''secondary'' artists like Caillebotte, an excellent sculpture garden and substantial Old Master holdings. Material from the latter collections forms part of a current show, ''The Body of Christ in the Art of Europe and New Spain.'' Included is one of Zurbaran's most touching paintings, showing the Lamb of God trussed for sacrifice, as well as works by Durer and Giovanni Bellini. A third building for the Museum of Fine Arts is now under construction and scheduled for opening in the spring of 2000. The largest museum of its kind in the Southwest, though not in the same league with the Kimbell in Fort Worth, it has made a particular effort to involve the Hispanic community in its programs. The impulse to reach out is also evident on once-a-month family days, with free admission, at Bayou Bend, a mini-Winterthur bequeathed to the museum by Ima Hogg, the unfortunately named daughter of Texas's first native-born Governor. Named for the lazy stream that flows through the 14-acre property, Bayou Bend, a pale pink house built in 1927, stands amid gardens adorned with statues and fountains and notable for their azaleas, now approaching full bloom. Reached by a pedestrian suspension bridge that crosses the bayou, the house contains 4,800 English and American objects installed in 28 room settings. There is a silver sugar bowl by Paul Revere and a refined lyre-base epergne by an anonymous English craftsman; portraits by Copley and Charles Willson Peale; furniture by Duncan Phyfe and Benjamin H. Latrobe, a corner cupboard filled with delicate creamware and another with rustic Pennsylvania spatterware. Miss Hogg, whose brother Will developed River Oaks, was also a founder of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Once overseen by such notables as Leopold Stokowski and Sir John Barbirolli, it has embellished its reputation under Christoph Eschenbach, whose style has been compared to that of Wilhelm Furtwangler, the great German conductor. Mr. Eschenbach's tenure as music director here ends next May, and no successor has been chosen; he himself is mentioned among potential successors to Claudio Abbado when he leaves the Berlin Philharmonic in 2002. Houston also has a first-rate resident stage company, the Alley Theater, in business since 1946, which mounts a dozen or so productions a year on two stages; a nationally known ballet company under Ben Stevenson, its artistic director, and the innovative Houston Grand Opera, with which the ballet shares the new Wortham Theater Center at the heart of the revitalized theater district downtown. A little too revitalized: the recently opened Bayou Place, a complex of restaurants and performance spaces, has taxed the area's parking resources. There are also problems with crowd circulation at the otherwise splendid Wortham Theater Center, which houses a 2,200-seat auditorium and a 1,100-seat hall. In 25 years as the opera company's general director, David Gockley has championed modern opera, staging many world premieres, and brought semi-operatic American musicals like Porgy and Bess and Showboat into the opera house. One of this year's features was the Francesca Zambello production of Benjamin Britten's Billy Budd, which won awards at Covent Garden and at the Opera Bastille in Paris. It starred the hot young Danish baritone Bo Skovhus, making only his second American operatic appearance after singing in San Francisco earlier. If I had to choose Houston's premier art form, it would be architecture. Long before Mr. Piano's eloquently understated building for the Menil Collection went up, long before the Astrodome, there were interesting, mostly modern structures in Houston's three main nodes -- downtown, the Galleria area to the west and the Rice University/Texas Medical Center neighborhood to the south. The Rice campus, where building began in 1912, is arranged in a series of quadrangles laid out by Ralph Adams Cram (a new master plan has been prepared by Cesar Pelli). Cram used collegiate Gothic at West Point and Princeton, but for Houston's climate, he decided that a generalized Mediterranean style would be appropriate. Rice's new showplace is the Baker Institute for Public Policy, named for George Bush's Secretary of State and headed by Edward P. Djerejian, a former Ambassador to Israel and Syria. With state-of-the-art conference facilities, it aspires to a place alongside similar centers at Harvard and Princeton. Just to the south rise the architecturally mediocre buildings of the medical center, one of the finest in the country. It embraces almost 40 hospitals and medical and nursing schools, including the outstanding M. D. Anderson cancer clinic. Two of the nation's most celebrated heart surgeons, Dr. Michael E. DeBakey and Dr. Denton Cooley, perform operations at the center. Downtown, where the city was founded in 1836 by its own Romulus and Remus, the brothers Augustus C. and John K. Allen of New York, is a forest of silver and green and terra-cotta-colored skyscrapers leaping from the flatlands. Among the best are the Enron Building, oval in cross-section, wrapped in a sleek membrane of white aluminum and silvered glass, with a neon ''halo'' around the top at night; the beautifully proportioned Tenneco building, now known as the El Paso Energy Building, by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and the massive 71-story Wells Fargo Plaza, composed of two quarter-round towers, clad in dark green glass and offset from one another by 15 feet. But Houston is Philip Johnson country, home to some of his most acclaimed buildings. Pennzoil Place, at 711 Louisiana Street, is the most spectacular of Mr. Johnson's downtown designs, a pair of wedge-shaped towers, their tops lopped off at a 45-degree angle, joined at the base by a glassed-in pedestrian gallery filled with trees, flowers and sunlight. Less successful, if no less distinctive, is the Republic Bank Center at 700 Louisiana Street, built of Swedish red granite. Drawing upon and vastly magnifying the distinctive stepped gables of 16th-century Dutch churches and houses, it jabs an astonishing silhouette into the Texas sky. At the feet of these and other buildings is a delightful array of public sculpture by Oldenburg, Calder, Richard Lippold, Henry Moore, Dubuffet, Nevelson (''Frozen Laces,'' 1979) and Miro. The Miro, entitled ''Personage and Birds'' and completed in 1970, is an angular, Tinkertoy-like construction in primary colors that sits below I. M. Pei's Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Bank Building), a granite tower, cut at the corners, at 600 Travis Street. Mr. Johnson also designed a quadrangle at University of St. Thomas, not far from the Menil Collection, where he married Jefferson's plan at the University of Virginia to a Miesian esthetic. Right at the top of the main axis, where the rotunda stands in Charlottesville, Mr. Johnson recently completed a geometric tour de force, St. Basil's Chapel, composed of a white cube cut by a black plane and topped with a gold dome. Farther west, near the Galleria shopping mall, is yet another must-see Johnson project, designed with John Burgee: the Transco Tower, of which he wrote, ''This will always seem like the tallest building in the world.'' Though only 65 stories, it seems taller because it stands not with other skyscrapers but above low-rise retail buildings; it is, in fact,  the tallest building anywhere outside a city center. With its distinctive setbacks, it is reminiscent of the Empire State Building (and of some designs in the famous 1922 Tribune Tower competition in Chicago), executed not in stone but in faceted mirror glass. A revolving beacon on top adds to the Art Deco image. From the Alley Theater to Anthony's, From the Rothko Chapel to Pennzoil Place: Where to Cool the Heels and Drench the Senses Here is information about Houston: Where to Stay THE LANCASTER HOTEL, 701 Texas Avenue, in the heart of the downtown theater (and concert and opera) district, was restored to its original 1920's elegance a few years ago; with a cheery, canary-yellow lobby and gleaming antiques in many of its 93 bedrooms, this is one of Houston's gems. Actors and singers love the food in its Bistro and from its 24-hour room service. An unusually friendly staff provides solicitous service.  Rates: For double occupancy, daily weekday rates range from $255 to $300; Friday and Saturday rates range from $145 to $155. (713) 228-9500. THE FOUR SEASONS, 1300 Lamar Street, also downtown, is not one of the Canadian-owned chain's superstars, like its sisters in Chicago and Boston. But it's still a first-rate business and leisure hotel, with thick carpets downstairs and memorably comfortable beds upstairs. The hotel's employees try hard, but they seem overstressed on holiday weekends and during conventions. Ten of its 30 floors are devoted to apartments, mostly owned by well-off locals. Rates: For double occupancy, daily weekday rates range from $290 to $355; Friday and Saturday rates range from $145 to $205. (713) 650-1300. LUXURY COLLECTION, 1919 Briar Oaks Lane, in the Galleria area. The Hotel Formerly Known as Ritz, they might call it. But in fact, the best of Houston's hotels, having lost the right to use the Ritz-Carlton name, answers the phone, ''Luxury Collection,'' a clumsy moniker at best. Happily, the flowers and the lavish use of marble, plus the high staff-guest ratio, still make you feel as if you're staying on a peer's estate. Rates: For double occupancy, daily weekday rates range from $250 to $2,000; Friday and Saturday rates range from $135 to $2,000. (713) 840-7600. THE HOUSTONIAN, 111 North Post Oak Lane, west of downtown, is the most Texan of Houston's top hotels, which may or may not commend it to you. It sits on a woodsy, 22-acre site, and the lobby decor resembles that of a laid-back country lodge. Some of the 291 guest rooms are resplendent, some drab. The health club is top-notch. This was George Bush's voting address during his years in Washington, and where he stayed during trips back to Texas. Rates: Rates: Daily weekday rate based on double occupancy is $249; Friday and Saturday rate is $119. (713) 680-2626. LA COLOMBE D'OR, 3410 Montrose Boulevard. A Prairie-style mansion built in 1923 as a residence for Walter Fondren, the founder of Humble Oil, now part of the Exxon group, has been converted into an inn with a pricey Continental restaurant. Just six suites, each filled with antiques and modern art, the Colombe d'Or (Golden Dove) is conveniently near Houston museums, between downtown and the Galleria. It has most of the amenities of far bigger places. Rates: Double occupancy room rates range from $195 to $275; $575 for the penthouse, weekdays or weekends. (713) 524-7999. Where to Eat CAFE ANNIE, 1728 Post Oak Boulevard, for my money, is the best restaurant in Houston and maybe the best in Texas, which is saying something. Like many good restaurants here, it's incongruously housed in a strip mall, but inside, the mahogany paneling glows luxuriously. Shy, serious and bursting with talent, Robert del Grande, the chef, cooks bold food with roots in both the Mexican and European traditions: coffee-roasted beef, on one hand, and a perfectly seared scallop paired with foie gras on the other. Mimi, his animated wife, deftly directs the dining room. Do not deny yourself the warm chocolate cake with a beret of coffee meringue on top, or a bottle or two from the formidable wine list. (713) 840-1111. BRENNAN'S OF HOUSTON, 3300 Smith Street. Houston shares the Gulf and its humidity with New Orleans, so it is not surprising that the Crescent City's Brennan clan has put down roots here, too. At their local outpost, the chef, Carl Walker, adds Texas touches to Creole favorites -- shrimp remoulade with a vinegary corn-jalapeno relish on the side, for example -- and creates brilliant new dishes, like boneless quail on spicy spinach, served with a crawfish enchilada. Sunday brunch, with the jazz singer Yvonne Washington, is a real treat. (713) 522-9711. ANTHONY'S, 4007 Westheimer Road. Tony Vallone has been numero uno in Houston dining forever, but for me, the clientele at his flagship, Tony's, with its 25,000-bottle wine list and fondness for truffles, is too preoccupied with who's who and who's wearing what. Not so at Anthony's, his ambitious but relaxed second restaurant. The Pompeian red decor is a bit gaudy, but this is Texas, and we were dazzled by a lunch that included duck pillows with ponzu and pear essence; a small, chewy lobster and crabmeat souffle, and a flawless piece of grilled superfresh red snapper. The good wine list is inexplicably weak in Italian vintages. (713) 961-0552. MARK'S, 1658 Westheimer Road. Mark Cox used to cook at Tony's; now he cooks for himself, at Mark's, a crowded, casual spot in a deconsecrated red-brick church. The waiters are still learning, but you'll enjoy the first-course salad of pears, greens and Gorgonzola, and the nursery desserts -- fresh-made strawberry shortcake and a grown-up version of campfire s'mores, with gooey chocolate and marshmallow cream. Try the Chilean sea bass, if it's on the menu, with charred edges and melting flesh, or the pasta with boned shortribs of beef, or (remember, you're in Longhorn country) the classic strip or rib-eye steaks. (713) 523-3800. LATIN MENUS. Houstonians love Latin food. You can sample Tex-Mex at the original Ninfa's, 2704 Navigation Street, (713) 228-1175, a Bush family favorite, where the skirt-steak fajitas are still made with care. You can try Tex-Tex at Mr. del Grande's terrific new self-service cafe, Taco Milagro, on Westheimer Road at 2255 Kirby Drive, (713) 522-1999, where the margaritas are unsweetened, the salsas are freshly made each day and the pork barbacoa enchiladas with milagro mole sauce will knock your socks off (if you're wearing any). Or try Latin modern in a wacky setting at Americas, 1800 Post Oak Boulevard, (713) 961-1492; one of the best dishes is taquito de cordoniz (bacon-wrapped quail chunks on a flour tortilla). GOODE CO. Then there is Jim Goode, who will show you how to eat well hereabouts for a few bucks. At Goode Co. Texas Bar-B-Q (sorry about the orthography), 5109 Kirby Drive, a shed stuffed with buffalo heads and other such nonsense, grab a long-neck Shiner Bock beer and order a beef brisket sandwich (sliced, not chopped) on jalapeno cheese bread. It's the real thing. (713) 522-2530. Around the corner, at Goode Co. Texas Seafood, 2621 Westpark, go for Gulf-fresh shrimp -- in a po' boy sandwich, mesquite-grilled with remoulade sauce or in a campechana, a Mexican-style seafood cocktail, served in a sundae glass with a sauce the color of Maureen O'Hara's hair. (713) 523-7154. Sites WORTHAM THEATER CENTER, Texas Avenue at Smith Street. The Houston Grand Opera is dark until March 13.

       " 'WASHINGTON — The Senate summarily blocked three measures on Thursday — including one backed by President Trump — to resolve the fate of the so-called Dreamers, leaving hundreds of thousands of them facing an uncertain future. As senators struck down measure after measure, a week that began with the promise of a rare open, free-ranging debate on the issue crashed headlong into the same divisions that have prevented Congress from fixing the nation’s immigration system for decades. The lack of consensus left in question whether any solution on the Dreamers can be reached. In a rebuke to the president, senators voted overwhelmingly, 39 to 60, against the White House-backed bill, which would have committed $25 billion for a wall along the border with Mexico, placed strict limits on legal immigration, ended the diversity visa lottery and offered 1.8 million Dreamers an eventual path to citizenship. Senators were 21 votes short of the 60 required to open debate, and the rejection of the president’s plan was bipartisan: Democrats refused its get-tough approach to legal immigration, while many conservative Republicans derided it as amnesty. Before the vote on Mr. Trump’s plan, senators rejected two bipartisan measures, including one written by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, and another drafted by a broad bipartisan group of centrists calling themselves the Common Sense Coalition. The votes were a stark reminder that Congress remains paralyzed by the immigration issue. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush both tried to overhaul the system, but were stymied by lawmakers frozen into inaction, in part because of powerful interests on both sides. What will happen now is unclear. An estimated 690,000 young undocumented immigrants have been protected from deportation by an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Another 1.1 million would be eligible. But Mr. Trump has rescinded the program, which offers temporary, renewable work permits. It expires March 5. The White House had worked vigorously to oppose the centrist bill, which the Department of Homeland Security labeled “a mass amnesty for over 10 million illegal aliens.” Senators of both parties said afterward that the Trump administration was instrumental in its defeat. “I don’t think the president helped very much, but the bottom line is the demagogues won again on the left and the right,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a key sponsor of the Senate measure. Some Dreamers, many of whom have known no country other than the United States, are hopeful that the judicial system will protect them.  Two federal courts  have issued injunctions ordering the Trump administration to keep DACA in place for those already receiving its protections, but the Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to intervene and overturn lower court rulings. Thursday’s votes came after Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, had set aside this week for senators to try to write a bill from scratch. Some senators said it was possible that lawmakers would attach an immigration bill to a catchall spending measure that must pass by March 23, when funding for the federal government expires. Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said he did not envision Mr. McConnell allowing more time for lawmakers to debate the issue. “I don’t see it,” Mr. Cornyn said. “If we couldn’t get it together this week, I mean, we’ve got other things we have to do, which are pressing.” In the run-up to the debate, the bipartisan Common Sense Coalition measure, sponsored by seven Democrats, eight Republicans and one independent, was thought to have the best chance to clear the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the Senate. It would have appropriated $25 billion for border security, including construction of the president’s proposed wall, over a 10-year period — but not immediately, as Mr. Trump demands. It also included an eventual path to citizenship, over 10 to 12 years, for 1.8 million of the young undocumented immigrants, but would have precluded them from sponsoring their parents to become citizens. And it did not make changes to the diversity visa lottery system, which Mr. Trump wants to end. The White House attacked the plan as a grievous threat to national security and asserted that its sponsors were either complicit in wanting to undermine the United States’ immigration laws or misinformed about the drastic effects that the proposal would have. In a conference call with reporters before voting began, a senior White House official lashed out at Mr. Graham. Speaking only on the condition of anonymity despite repeated requests to be on the record, the official accused Mr. Graham of attacking homeland security officials and standing in the way of needed immigration changes. “Senator Graham has been an obstacle for those reforms,” the official said. The official accused Mr. Graham of misleading other senators, including Democrats, about the damage the proposal would do, and said that Democrats should not let “Lindsey Graham dictate what Democrat senators ought to do.” On Capitol Hill, Mr. Graham took aim at Stephen Miller, a top White House aide and an immigration hard-liner. “As long as the president allows Steve Miller and others to run the show down there, we’re never going to get anywhere,” he said. After the legislative failures in the Senate, top White House officials said they plan to turn their attention to the House, where Republicans are working on a similar hard-line immigration plan that Mr. Trump has also embraced. Republicans may have more success approving the bill in the House, where they control the chamber and need only a simple majority to pass legislation. Mr. Trump praised the House legislation on Thursday, saying that it “enshrines” his immigration principles. Later Thursday night, the White House released a statement in support of advancing that legislation and denouncing the “Schumer Democrats,” referencing Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. The statement said that the Democrats “are not serious about DACA, they are not serious about immigration reform, and they are not serious about homeland security.” In the meantime, advocates estimate that more than 100 of the young immigrants lose their protected status each day. On March 5, they say, the number could rise to as many as 1,400 a day. And while the president has said repeatedly that he wants to protect the Dreamers — at one point he called on Congress to pass a  bipartisan “bill of love”  — many blame him for refusing to accept the bipartisan deal. “The president is not negotiating in good faith,” said Juan Escalante, 28, who was born in Venezuela and now works for America’s Voice, an immigrant rights group. “If you ask me, as an impacted party who essentially has everything to lose — my driver’s license and my work permit and my livelihood in this country — that is not any way to negotiate a deal.” White House officials are betting that House passage of a bill to protect the Dreamers will put enormous pressure on Democrats in the Senate. But immigrant rights activists and Democrats — and some Republicans in the Senate — have repeatedly vowed to oppose the House legislation, which they call outrageous and hurtful. That could leave the issue mired in stalemate as neither chamber can embrace legislation that the other chamber is willing to pass. “No one comes out a winner in this,” a dejected-sounding Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia and a chairman of the Common Sense Coalition, said after the Senate vote. “We tried everything.”',\n",
       " 'WILLIAMSON, W.Va. — Hillary Clinton came to campaign in coal country — and she had her feet held to the fire. As Mrs. Clinton stepped onto the sidewalk on Monday to tour a health and wellness center here, a crowd of protesters stood in the rain, many of them holding signs supporting the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, and chanted, “Go home!” Later, when Mrs. Clinton sat down with residents to discuss health care and other issues affecting the community and coal miners in particular, the chants of the protesters outside could still be heard.  “No matter what they might be saying out there, they have a friend,” Senator Joe Manchin III, who accompanied Mrs. Clinton, told the panel participants. But not everyone was buying it.  “Supporting her hurts you,” Bo Copley, a 39-year-old father who tearfully explained that he had lost his job in the coal industry and who struggled to support his family, pointedly told Mr. Manchin.  Mr. Copley then raised a topic with Mrs. Clinton that appeared to be on many of the protesters’ minds (and signs): a remark she made to CNN in March, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” How could she say that and now say she wanted to help West Virginians? he asked. Republicans seized on the remarks — which Mrs. Clinton made in the context of creating clean-energy jobs in areas of the country that had previously depended on coal — and blasted them out as evidence that a Hillary Clinton presidency would hurt coal country. America Rising, an anti-Clinton “super PAC,” called the comments a “brazen disregard for the men and women who help power America.” Mrs. Clinton told Mr. Copley, whose wife, Lauren, sat next to him at the round table, that her statement in the CNN town hall-style forum “was totally taken out of context” and explained that she had presented a plan to help coal country last summer and was committed to the issue.  “The way things are going now we will continue to lose jobs,” she said. “I didn’t mean that we were going to do it,” but rather “that was going to happen if we don’t take action.” But, Mrs. Clinton added, “I don’t mind anybody being upset or angry,” given the desperation in Appalachia, where she will spend Monday and Tuesday with campaign events in West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. She said, however, that she was “a bit sad and sorry that I gave people an excuse to be angry at me because that’s not what I said at all.” At one point, Mr. Manchin, who Mrs. Clinton called to apologize after making the remark to CNN, stepped in on the former secretary of state’s behalf. “If I thought she wanted to eliminate one job in West Virginia, I wouldn’t be sitting here,” he told his constituents. Mrs. Clinton acknowledged she would have a difficult path to win voters over in the May 10 Democratic primary and in the general election. “I understand the anger and I understand the fear and I understand the disappointment that is being expressed. How could it not be given what’s going on here?” she said. “Because of the misstatement that I made, which I apologized for when I saw how it was being used,” she continued,  “I know that my chances are pretty difficult, to be honest.” As for Mr. Copley, he said he won’t be voting in the Democratic primary. “I’m a registered Republican,” he said.',\n",

       " 'POWELLTON, W.Va. — Deep in the belly of an Appalachian mountain, a powerful machine bored into the earth, its whirring teeth clawing out a stream of glistening coal. Men followed inside the Maple Eagle No. 1 mine, their torches cutting through the dank air. One guided the machine with a PlayStation-like controller; others bolted supports in the freshly cut roof. They were angry. The coal industry that made West Virginia prosperous has been devastated. Every day, it seemed, another mine laid off workers or closed entirely. Friends were forfeiting their cars, homes and futures. For these men, this season’s presidential campaign boils down to a single choice. “I’m for Trump,” said Dwayne Riston, 27, his face smeared in dust. “Way I see it, if he wins, we might at least stand a chance of surviving.” Few places in America offer such a simple electoral calculus as the rolling, tree-studded hills of West Virginia. Even as  Donald J. Trump , the Republican presidential nominee, lags badly in crucial swing states and  loses his grip on white male voters over all , he remains on solid ground here with  his promise  to “bring back coal.” The fact that his Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton,  said in March , “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” has helped, too. But this is not just about economics. West Virginia’s coal country is part of the broader white, working-class vote that has coalesced around a single candidate, Mr. Trump, like never before. His support here stems from a profound, decades-in-the-making sense of  political and cultural alienation  that has left people feeling distant from their leaders, and even from fellow Americans. “I kind of feel that people are looking down on us,” said Neil Hanshew, a miner, voicing a common sentiment. “They’re looking at us like we’re a bunch of dumb hillbillies who can’t do anything else.” I found my way to the Maple Eagle No. 1 mine after I met the mine manager at a church in Mingo County, famed as the center of the  Hatfield-McCoy feud  more than a century ago, when rival clan members battled it out along the border with Kentucky. This is not my regular beat — I’m usually reporting on the Arab world as The New York Times’s bureau chief in Cairo, but I have come to the United States for a few months to  cover this unusual campaign  from a foreigner’s perspective. After Mr. Trump’s  combative nominating convention  in Cleveland and  Mrs. Clinton’s coronation  in Philadelphia, I hit the road to explore how the campaign themes were playing out on the ground. Mingo County, a picturesque district of twisting valleys, is steeped in the lore of coal, corruption and violence. A gun battle between mine company officials and unionized workers in 1920 brought the nickname “Bloody Mingo,” fodder today for history tourists and TV serials. I checked into a hotel in the county seat, Williamson, where the manager offered a run-down of the area’s more recent dramas. In 2013, the county sheriff  was murdered   as he ate lunch  in his patrol car. A year later, a senior judge  was jailed on corruption charges  (“Folks knew him as ‘the king,’” the manager said). More recently, the local coal magnate, Donald L. Blankenship, started  a one-year prison sentence  for breaching safety standards at a mine where 29 miners died in an accident in 2010. And in May, a wealthy coal executive was  fatally shot  in the town cemetery as he visited his wife’s grave. A pair of drug addicts have been arrested. Williamson itself, a town of 3,000, is a picture of social and economic decay. Unemployment, at 12 percent, is more than twice the United States average. Cash-for-gold stores crowd alongside lawyers’ offices and gun dealerships. Rates of heroin overdoses and obesity are among the highest in America. Many residents scrape by on food stamps. In the surrounding hills, abandoned coal mines hum with the noise of ventilation pumps still circulating oxygen through the empty shafts, in the hope that they might one day be reopened. Yet the people of Mingo County have forged their own brand of resilience, one born of the tight-knit rural values that draw embattled citizens together. For some, that means planning for a better future: Dr. Dino Beckett, a local physician, has spearheaded initiatives to grow healthy food locally and reduce diabetes. For others, it means lifting a defiant finger to the outside world. At the  Regional Church  in Delbarton, 10 miles from Williamson, Sunday services were both exuberant and solemn, a mark of the conservative Christianity that holds strong here. Peals of catchy gospel songs were followed by a fervent sermon delivered by an evangelical missionary who had taken 900 Jewish immigrants to Israel (in fulfillment of a biblical prophesy, she explained) and sought to convert Arab Muslims. Among the singers on stage was Bo Copley, the area’s most famous out-of-work miner. His celebrity stems from  a visit Mrs. Clinton made to Williamson in May , when hundreds of jeering protesters, many wielding Trump signs, lined the main street. “Go home!” they yelled as Mrs. Clinton, wearing a strained smile, slipped into a private meeting. Mrs. Clinton has apologized for her comment about putting coal out of business, saying she was misunderstood. But Mr. Copley, who had been called to meet Mrs. Clinton, challenged her, sliding a photo of his three young children across the table while the television cameras rolled. “How can you come in here and tell us you’re going to be our friend?” he said, his voice cracking with emotion. “Because those people out there don’t see you as a friend.” Days later, at a Trump rally in the state capital, Charleston, Mr. Copley received a standing ovation. “People are tired of politicians,” he told me during my visit. “Trump is a break from the status quo, which promises the moon but doesn’t deliver.” He struck a chord across coal country, giving voice to the inchoate rage and impotence that has accompanied the near-collapse, in less than a decade, of a lucrative industry. With salaries starting at $70,000 a year, a job in the mines was long considered the local jackpot. Mingo County’s breathtaking valleys and hollers — narrow creeks bordered by high hills — are lined with spacious homes, swimming pools and gleaming vehicles. Now, there is a palpable fear that the good life is gone, perhaps for good. Jeremy Queen, 35, earned $30 an hour in a mine a few years ago. Now he is working security at a Walmart for $10.50 an hour, and the economic slump means even the shopping mall that houses his store is suffering. “When the mines go down, it hurts everything,” he said. Political fury in Mingo County focuses squarely on the Environmental Protection Agency and President Obama, who is seen as having started a “war on coal.” Issues of race and class bubble under the surface: Mingo County, population 27,000, is 97 percent white, and racial epithets that are taboo in much of America still ring out openly. Support for Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim immigrants is strong, even though Muslims constitute only a tiny fraction of West Virginians. In 2012, local Democrats  selected Keith Judd , a felon incarcerated in Texas, as their nominee for president instead of Mr. Obama. On a sleepy Sunday afternoon, a red pickup truck rolled slowly along Williamson’s main street, bearing two giant flags: one for Mr. Trump, the other emblazoned with the Confederate colors. Corey Matney, 26 years old and wearing a National Rifle Association T-shirt, stepped out and asked why I was taking pictures. Of the Confederate flag, he said, “That’s heritage, not hate.” Mr. Matney, who was in Williamson to play Pokémon Go with his girlfriend, is a linesman for a telecommunications company that, he said, is losing 500 customers a month. “Families are moving away,” he said. “I know Donald Trump may not be the best man for the job. But he’s the lesser of two evils.” There is no doubt that Mr. Trump, a brash Manhattan tycoon who lives in a gilded tower, can seem a discordant political idol for rural America. Many overlook that, pointing to his business success and his war on “political correctness” while berating Muslims and “tree-hugger” environmentalists. But some have been jarred by his ideas. Mr. Copley’s wife, Lauren, has a sister whose husband is Jordanian, and was upset by a recent question from her 6-year-old niece. “She said, ‘If Donald Trump comes in, does that mean that we have to leave?’” Ms. Copley recalled. Ms. Copley started to cry. “He just spouts off,” she said. “I can’t fathom that.” “Some of the things he says really bother me,” her husband added. “But we have a lot of people in this area who are very angry, very upset.” Mr. Trump and his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, have yet to explain how they will revive the coal industry. Aside from the Obama administration’s tough environmental regulations, the decline of coal is a product of hard economic realities: Natural gas, produced by new fracking technologies, is simply much cheaper. For West Virginians like Roger Ooten, 56, their ballots may be a mark of resignation more than one of hope. A giant Trump sign adorned the gate of Mr. Ooten’s neat house in Delbarton, where he sat on the porch, rocking gently on a chair. He retired after 16 years working at a mine in Turkey Creek. Now he watches in despair as the community around him crumbles. Mr. Ooten is following the election on conservative channels like Fox News. He doesn’t like Mr. Trump’s invective against Mexicans. “They gotta eat, too,” he said. “You can’t be mean to people.” But in November, Mr. Ooten will stick with Mr. Trump. “He’s the only shot we got,” he said. “Because if something doesn’t happen, this is going to be a ghost town.”',\n",
       " 'WILLIAMSON, W.Va. —  Hillary Clinton ’s campaign is trying to seize on the turmoil  Donald J. Trump ’s ascent has caused within the  Republican Party , hoping to gain the support of Republican voters and party leaders including former elected officials and retired generals disillusioned by their party’s standard-bearer. The efforts come after the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, on Thursday said he was  “just not ready” to back Mr. Trump , comments the Clinton campaign giddily blasted out in an email and on social media. At the same time, Priorities USA Action, a “ super PAC ” supporting Mrs. Clinton, intends to reach out to Republican megadonors disillusioned by their party’s presumptive nominee. More broadly, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign is repositioning itself, after a year of emphasizing liberal positions and focusing largely on minority voters, to also appeal to independent and Republican-leaning white voters turned off by Mr. Trump. With the Democratic nomination in sight, Mrs. Clinton has broadened her economic message, devoted days to apologizing for a comment she previously made that angered working-class whites, and pledged that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who remains widely popular among the blue-collar voters drawn to Mr. Trump, would “come out of retirement and be in charge” of creating jobs in places that have been particularly hard hit. The effort is a striking turn after she spent the past year trying to mobilize the liberal wing and labor leaders in the Democratic Party. But her campaign, confident that the young people and liberals backing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will come around to support Mrs. Clinton in November, is focusing its efforts on white working-class women and suburban women who tend to vote for Republican presidential candidates, but who polls show hold negative views of Mr. Trump. “I’m here because I want you to know whether people vote for me or not, whether they yell at me or not, it’s not going to affect what I will do to help,” Mrs. Clinton told residents at a health clinic here on Monday, as protesters’ chants outside of “Hillary, go home!” could be heard. The campaign expects to assemble a “Republicans for Hillary” group, and Mrs. Clinton has, from her days in the Senate and as secretary of state, cultivated strong relationships with prominent Republicans and their top staff members. Mark Salter, a top adviser to Senator John McCain, this week  expressed his support for Mrs. Clinton on Twitter  minutes after Mr. Trump clinched his party’s nomination. Mrs. Clinton has also enjoyed a strong relationship with former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, a Republican, who described her as “a superb representative of the United States all over the world.” In the past, Mrs. Clinton has praised David H. Petraeus, former director of the C.I.A., who is a Republican. In February, he said that Mrs. Clinton would be “a tremendous president.” Mrs. Clinton’s two-day swing across Appalachia this week served as the beginning of the campaign’s full-court press to convince persuadable white voters that she would run a more inclusive campaign than Mr. Trump — and to signal that she would cede no demographic group to him. “I invite a lot of Republicans and independents who I’ve been seeing on the campaign trail, who’ve been reaching out to me, I invite them to join with Democrats,” Mrs. Clinton  told CNN on Wednesday . “Let’s get off the red or the blue team. Let’s get on the American team.” In the Democratic primary, Mrs. Clinton has struggled with non-college-educated white voters and self-identified independents, often losing those groups by wide margins to Mr. Sanders. But faced with the choice between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, 51 percent of independents and 59 percent of moderates favor the former secretary of state, compared with 41 percent and 39 percent for Mr. Trump, according to  the most recent CNN/ORC poll . “If the primary happened to be over already, we feel the coalition we’ve built has the makings of a winning coalition as it is in a general election,” said Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman. “But,” he added, “we’re not satisfied with that. We want to make inroads even with populations that aren’t supporting her in great numbers.” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton, said while campaigning with her at a diner in Athens, Ohio, on Tuesday that the suburban women in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati could ultimately decide the November election. “I think educated suburban white women, to be sure, are going to be turned off en masse and there will be more of that,” he said, referring to their opinion of Mr. Trump. On Friday, President Obama helped in Mrs. Clinton’s effort. “Republican women, voters, are going to have to decide, ‘Is that the guy I feel comfortable with representing me, and what I care about?’”  he said of Mr. Trump at a news conference . But if Mrs. Clinton’s “Breaking Down Barriers Tour” in Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia this week provided a road map for her campaign’s strategy in the weeks ahead, the antagonistic reception she received also highlighted her own vulnerabilities and tendency to divide people — weaknesses Mr. Trump plans to exploit. At Mrs. Clinton’s event in Athens, a protester, Peter Schmidt, 34 and a miller, held a handmade sign that read “I’d Rather Be Home Reading Your Goldman Sachs Transcripts,” a reference to the paid speeches she delivered to the Wall Street bank. Mr. Schmidt said her tour of Appalachia felt like pandering. “I don’t trust her,” he said. “That’s why I’m holding this sign.” Mr. Trump, who has proved adept in connecting with white working-class men, also plans to hit Mrs. Clinton on her previous support for global trade deals that many Americans blame for jobs moving overseas. He has giddily seized on a  comment she made to CNN in March  that “we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” The  backlash over that remark  — made in the context of replacing coal with clean energy jobs — turned Mrs. Clinton’s campaign events into an Appalachian apology tour, as she was repeatedly, and pointedly, forced to explain what she called a “misstatement.” “I can’t take it back,” Mrs. Clinton told one out-of-work coal industry worker, Bo Copley, 39, a father of three and a registered Republican, when he emotionally confronted her about the comment. “What I want you to know is I’m going to do everything I can to help no matter what happens politically,” she added. “That is just how I am made.” The Clinton campaign is also moving to exploit the public criticism of Mr. Trump by prominent Republicans. On Wednesday, the campaign released an online ad that quotes Mr. Trump’s former primary opponents describing him as a “know-nothing candidate,” “a narcissist” and “the most vulgar person ever to aspire to the presidency,” among other epithets. Mrs. Clinton has portrayed Mr. Trump as a “loose cannon” on foreign policy and often points to her husband’s record as evidence that she would help blue-collar voters. “The brilliance of Bill Clinton gives her a particular edge,” said Gaston Caperton, a Democratic former governor of West Virginia who supports Mrs. Clinton. Even with Mr. Clinton in its corner, the Clinton campaign does not expect to win voters like Mr. Copley, who said he is undecided but who generally fits Mr. Trump’s core demographic of supporters. But Mrs. Clinton hopes to make inroads with women like Mr. Copley’s wife, Lauren — voters whom Clinton aides call “megachurch moms” and describe as religious, Republican-leaning women who reject Mr. Trump. Christine Matthews, a researcher who advises Republicans on how to win female voters, said that portraying Mr. Trump as dangerous on foreign policy could help Mrs. Clinton draw some Republican women whose most important issues are national security and terrorism. “Can she drive moms who have kids who think, ‘Oh my gosh, this is too scary a prospect and our country won’t be safe if he’s elected president?’ ” Ms. Matthews said. “You can imagine that attack ad in your head.” Democrats acknowledge that the prospect of terrifying skeptical voters into supporting their candidate would not be the most inspirational campaign message. It is a far bleaker appeal than Ronald Reagan’s message of American exceptionalism and Mr. Clinton’s promise to restore “the forgotten middle class,” both of which inspired white working-class voters to cross party lines. But Mrs. Clinton’s pitch to Republicans reflects the grim political realities of 2016: More than half of the registered voters who said they would vote for Mrs. Clinton planned to do so in opposition to Mr. Trump, rather than in support of her candidacy, according to the CNN/ORC poll. “Her bumper sticker for Republicans should be ‘Unified Against Trump’ or ‘Vote for the enemy. It’s important,’ ” said Ben Howe, a Republican and a contributing editor at the conservative online publication Red State, who posted the Clinton campaign’s #ImWithHer slogan on Twitter after Mr. Trump’s decisive victory in Indiana. Or, as Jan Franck, 65, a retiree in Charleston, W.Va., put it after hearing Mrs. Clinton speak on Tuesday: “She could be a sock puppet running against Donald Trump, and I’d vote for her.”',\n",
       " 'CHARLESTON, W.Va. — With West Virginia’s economy battered by a coal industry  in free fall , Senator  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont is hoping that a strong showing in this state’s Democratic primary on Tuesday will keep him a force in the party’s politics by showing that his message still resonates, even though his rival,  Hillary Clinton , has an almost insurmountable lead in delegates. As Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have campaigned here in recent weeks, they have found frustrated voters who express the kinds of anxieties heard all across the country — only with a far greater degree of urgency and pain, as they see their communities wither before their eyes. “We just don’t want to be forgotten,” said Betty Dolin, who co-owns a restaurant in Danville, about 20 miles southwest of Charleston, where customers tucked into hearty meals like meatloaf and country fried steak with gravy. She pointed out the empty tables that would once have been filled. “We can’t have coal? Bring us something else,” she said. “And I don’t mean job training. A lot of these men are too old to train for another job.” Presidential primaries tend to bring attention to local issues as candidates move from state to state, and as the candidates have come to West Virginia to campaign, coal has been no exception. “These communities need help,” Mr. Sanders said last week at a food bank in McDowell County. “It is not the coal miners’ fault in terms of what’s happening in this world.” In some ways, Mr. Sanders is not a natural candidate to be courting the votes of coal miners: He is outspoken on  climate change  and advocates moving away from fossil fuels. But his message of economic fairness has been embraced by white, working-class voters. Mr. Sanders has proposed legislation that would  provide $41 billion  to help coal and other fossil fuel workers and their communities, offering support like financial assistance and job training. Mrs. Clinton has her own  $30 billion plan  to help coal miners and their communities, including a program to help school districts that are losing revenue. But what people here bring up is a comment she made about coal workers in March, when she said during a televised forum, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” She was talking about providing opportunity through clean energy, and she emphasized that coal miners must not be left behind, but the sound bite was a damning one. When Mrs. Clinton  visited Mingo County  last week, she was met with chants of “Go home!” from protesters. At a round-table event, Bo Copley, a 39-year-old father who had lost his job in the coal industry, told her, “I just want to know how you can say you’re going to put a lot of coal miners out of jobs and then come in here and tell us how you’re going to be our friend.” Mrs. Clinton called her comment a “misstatement” and expressed regret. But it offended voters in struggling coal communities, and a candidate for West Virginia’s Supreme Court even used it  in a campaign ad . “A lot of people that I know are laid off, and you know that had to hurt the people,” said Janet White, 80, a librarian whose husband was a coal miner. With Donald J. Trump having  vanquished  his two remaining primary opponents last week, the Republican contest here holds little significance, but when Mr. Trump campaigned in West Virginia, he found a receptive audience. At a rally in Charleston last week, he donned a hard hat given to him by an industry group that had endorsed him, the West Virginia Coal Association, and mimicked shoveling coal. “My hair look O.K.?” he asked after taking the hat off. Mr. Trump gushed about mining, telling the crowd that he was fascinated by it and promising to revive the industry. “You watch what happens: If I win, we’re going to bring those miners back,” he said. “You’re going to be so proud of your president.” He did not explain how he would go about doing that. The signs of the state’s economic distress are all over, particularly in areas known for coal production, like Boone County, south of Charleston. In the window of a barbershop and beauty salon in Madison is a yellow sign: “We support coal and those who mine it!” But inside, Barbara Bias had no customers. The wives of coal miners used to come in with money to spend, she said. Not anymore. “Boone County used to be booming, and now there’s nothing,” she said. “This is a ghost town, because when the coal goes out, it hurts all of us.” In the last quarter of 2011, West Virginia had about 24,700 coal mining jobs; by the last quarter of 2015, that number had fallen to about 14,500, a decline of more than 40 percent, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The industry has suffered because of a combination of factors, and a slew of coal companies have filed for bankruptcy protection. The rise of hydraulic fracturing has caused a boom in  natural gas  production, driving down prices and prompting electric utilities to switch from coal to natural gas. A decade ago, coal was the source of about half of the country’s electricity generation; now, its share is  about one-third , according to the federal Energy Information Administration. Tougher environmental regulations have also taken a toll — the Obama administration  has pushed  to cut carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, and President Obama is deeply unpopular in West Virginia — as has a decline in demand for coal exports. “It’s a perfect storm of those three factors coming together at about the same time,” said John Deskins, the director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at West Virginia University. So far in 2016, coal production in West Virginia is down by more than a third compared with 2015, according to federal data.',\n",
       " 'It should be no surprise that The Village Voice has ended its print edition in favor of an online, digital-only presence. The alternative newspaper, whose weekly edition once helped set New York’s political and cultural agenda, is merely going the same route as a slew of other newspapers and magazines before it. It’s a path likely to be well-trod by others in the near future. At least the publication will continue, which is more than The Boston Phoenix or The San Francisco Bay Guardian or a host of other late-lamented alt-weeklies can say. “Welcome to the 21st Century,” was one nostalgia-spiking tweet that popped up within minutes of The Voice’s press release. And yet, the announcement by The Voice’s current owner that he is cutting his losses by giving up ink, paper, delivery trucks and the red plastic bins on the street corners that made you fear for your health each time you reached inside had the unmistakable feel of one more piece of Old New York slipping away. It’s a loss that hardly ranks with the deaths earlier this year of two of The Voice’s great stalwarts — Nat Hentoff, whose columns on civil liberties and other issues were a weekly feature for 50 years, and  Wayne Barrett , the old-school muckraker who was the first to report on a craftily ambitious young developer named Trump. The paper laid off both men in recent years in response to earlier economic concerns. Yet both would doubtlessly cheer for the paper to soldier on, even if no one will ever again spread a copy over a bar or across a table in a Greenwich Village coffee house. Hentoff and Barrett were just among the longest serving of a list of writers far too long to assemble who made The Voice, over several generations since its 1955 founding, a touchstone for against-the-grain journalism. It was a paper so famously cantankerous that Norman Mailer, a co-founder, quit writing for it out of rage over a copy-editing error; a paper where writers like Jack Newfield and Alexander Cockburn took up chunks of the letters page with pointed barbs against each other’s politics; where the poet and columnist joel oppenheimer wrote only in lower case; where the often feverish sentences of the dance critic Jill Johnston became an adventure in themselves; where the critic Ellen Willis properly called out the largely white male staff on their feminist failures. It was a paper whose tabloid layout lent itself to Jules Feiffer’s wistful Village characters, and the often bizarre antics of the street people depicted by his fellow cartoonists Stan Mack and Mark Alan Stamaty. Its pages carried a constant stream of photographs by The Voice’s Fred McDarrah, who managed to capture everyone from the Village political boss Carmine DeSapio to Andy Warhol hard at work in the Factory. It was also a paper once so rich with advertising that it was often too thick to fold in half and slip under your arm. Merchants and operators of book stores, music clubs, movie houses and futon shops managed to find ample customers among its hipster-readers, despite their thin pocketbooks. How many papers could brag that their readers literally lined up in front of newsstands in Sheridan Square and Astor Place on the Tuesday nights when it appeared in order to be among the first to get a crack at its classified ads for apartments, jobs and the notices placed by those looking for love in its back pages? In its heyday, The Voice threw off so much revenue that it became in a way its own worst enemy, attracting investors who liked the bottom line while reviling its style and attitude. It’s hard to believe now that Rupert Murdoch, at the same time he was turning The New York Post into the city’s leading conservative beacon, was briefly The Voice’s owner. On his arrival, employees promptly organized a union and began picketing the paper’s 11th Street offices. Mr. Murdoch moved on, eventually replaced by the pet-food magnate Leonard Stern, who moved the paper’s offices into his family’s old headquarters on Cooper Square. Whenever tenants on the upstairs floors stomped about, tiny brown bird seeds lodged in the beams rained down on the keyboards of staffers below. Even as its glory years fell behind it, the idea of The Village Voice continued to cast a spell far beyond the five boroughs, and its subscribers could be found around the country. On a trip to the blues belt of Mississippi in 2000, just before I began a second tour at the paper, I remember the wondrous gleam that came into people’s eyes when I said where I worked. “The Village Voice,” one lifelong Mississippian told me dreamily, “that’s a real newspaper.”',\n",
       " 'Beneath the artifice, the virtuosic singing and the foreign languages, opera’s stories are deeply familiar: tales of love, loss and duty that anyone could identify with. But lately, there’s another way that opera has been recognizable to many in its audiences: its dissatisfaction with the state of the world. During a recent operagoing trip to Europe, I was struck not by the extent to which productions were placed in the present — contemporary settings are routine there to an extent they are not in the United States — but by the degree to which they were critical of the universes they portrayed. They were, above all, savage and skeptical, and therefore felt very much of our moment. The most straightforward of the bunch was Simon McBurney’s  production of Stravinsky’s “The Rake’s Progress,”  at the Aix Festival in France. The sins of the young and rich — the protagonist, Tom Rakewell, enjoys a profligate life and enters into an ill-advised marriage — have not changed much since the 18th century, when the paintings and etchings on which the opera is based were created. Tom’s adviser, Nick Shadow, is the Devil himself, here a slick capitalist in a black suit who makes his pitch with a slide deck. Stravinsky’s angular, self-consciously antique score added pungent alienation to Mr. McBurney’s pointed references to smartphones, social media and reality television. Satirizing the 1 percent might seem like a dicey proposition for the fancy world of European summer music festivals. This isn’t new: Gérard Mortier’s time at the Salzburg Festival in Austria in the 1990s involved many such bracing provocations. But Aix-en-Provence isn’t Salzburg. Its atmosphere is comparatively down-to-earth — there’s no red carpet at the opera house — but also, by design, the programming is more contemplative than star-struck. In an interview at the start of the festival, Aix’s outgoing general director, Bernard Foccroulle, described his vision as one in which opera has “a vivid and creative relationship to the past, with a focus that is of our time.” The model should be one of “participation, not consumerism,” and he has sought to anchor the festival in larger artistic communities and to make connections with the broader Mediterranean world. Mr. Foccroulle’s approach was evident in the other work I saw at Aix, Bizet’s “ Carmen .” It’s opera’s ultimate golden oldie, but Dmitri Tcherniakov’s production, meticulously staged and performed with rare intensity, questions why we keep coming back to this story. The traditional Spanish setting has vanished, in favor of a complex framing narrative in which an alienated modern man in therapy is prescribed the enactment of Bizet’s deadly love story so he can reconnect with his emotions. This is the production’s sense of our world: deadened masculinity. It essentially replaces Don José’s obsession with Carmen (the character) with an obsession with “Carmen” (the opera). Despite its intricacy and novelty, though, it still felt utterly true to the characters’ stories. I can’t, however, make the same promise of accessibility when it comes to Krzysztof Warlikowski’s production of Franz Schreker’s 1918 rarity, “ Die Gezeichneten ,” which had its premiere at the Bavarian State Opera the previous week. While the libretto sets the work in the Italian Renaissance, this staging plays out, like “Rake,” among an immoral contemporary elite, a group of men in a corporate boardroom. The plot concerns Alviano Salvago, a disfigured outcast who constructs an island paradise, the pleasures of which go awry when other aristocrats use it as a base for abducting and assaulting the maidens of Genoa. Schreker wrote a cautionary tale of moral decadence, but his effusive post-Romantic musical style makes sin sound really good. This production was, above all, a showcase for the Bavarian State Opera’s outstanding, powerful orchestra, led here by Ingo Metzmacher. Singing with conviction and endurance, the cast included John Daszak as Alviano, and Catherine Naglestad as the painter Carlotta. Mr. Warlikowski’s production is best when he pushes at the boundaries between art and life, pleasure and immorality. A self-reflexive thread made Alviano into a Schreker stand-in, with the loss of his island paradise standing in for this composer’s condemnation by the Nazis. Sometimes the allusions were too much. (I still can’t figure out what the references to a Kafka story about mice were up to.) But Mr. Warlikowski’s enigmatic, melancholy images of showgirls, boxing rings, silent movies and performance art can be entrancing in their ambiguity, like a puzzle from a strange mind. If you’re into David Lynch, Mr. Warlikowski is the director for you. Perhaps the strongest argument for opera in Europe is the variety of approaches. In Zurich, a revival of Andreas Homoki’s production of Wagner’s “ Lohengrin ” offered a very different model of what opera can be. Set in a 19th-century Alpine village, it features characters who are pointedly closed off to a wider society. (This, in itself, may be a comment on that — on our — world.) The evening plays out in a plain wooden box, and the costumes of lederhosen and dirndls, while picturesque, are hardly the medieval dress of a conventional “Lohengrin.” The production rejects otherworldly effects: The knight-savior Lohengrin appears in a nightshirt amid a crowd of chorus members and never seems to wield any magical powers. The cast, with Brandon Jovanovich and Rachel Willis-Sorensen in the leading roles, was heartfelt, but, perhaps intentionally, never transcended the production’s intimate scale. The opera became a simple, quietly compelling, all too reverberant tale of a community in crisis. Mr. Homoki’s rejection of allegory is unusual for “Lohengrin,” an opera whose questions of faith, trust and social cohesion have often lent themselves to fanciful interpretations, like Hans Neuenfels’s mouse-themed  production  for the Bayreuth Festival in Germany. After the rich food for thought in Aix and Munich, I found Mr. Homoki’s approach rather plain, however luminous Fabio Luisi’s conducting was. But it is never boring, and its careful craft and expressivity have their own kind of honesty, particularly in the intimate space of Zurich’s opera house. It’s also noteworthy that all these productions featured prominent, and excellent, performances by American singers: As well as Ms. Naglestad, Mr. Jovanovich and Ms. Willis-Sorensen, the list also included Michael Fabiano in “Carmen,” and Paul Appleby and Julia Bullock in “Rake’s Progress.” You hope they will bring something from these adventurous and intense operatic experiments back home.',\n",
       " 'WILLIAMSON, W.Va. — If a single moment captured coal country’s despair this year, it was when Bo Copley, a soft-spoken, out-of-work mine maintenance planner, fought tears as he asked Hillary Clinton how, having dismissed coal’s future in language that came back to haunt her, she could “come in here and tell us you’re going to be our friend.” That was in May. Mr. Copley, 39 and a registered Republican, was “very uncomfortable” with  Donald J. Trump  then, he said. But over time, in a paradox of the Bible Belt, Mr. Copley, a deeply religious father of three, put his faith in a trash-talking, thrice-married Manhattan real estate mogul as a savior for coal country — and America. “God has used unjust people to do his will,” Mr. Copley said, explaining his vote. Now coal country is reckoning with an inconvenient truth: Experts say Mr. Trump’s expansive campaign promise to “put our miners back to work” will be  very difficult to keep . Yet as he prepares to move into the Oval Office, Appalachians are eyeing Washington with a feeling they have not had in years: hope. The American market for coal is shrinking, industry analysts agree. Utility companies have drastically reduced their reliance on coal, in part because of  President Obama ’s aggressive regulations to cut emissions from power plants, but also because  natural gas  is cheaper. Nationally, about 300 coal-fired power plants have closed since 2008, according to the National Mining Association, a trade group. Many of those plants — including one in nearby Louisa, Ky., where a giant cooling tower was  recently demolished  after the plant converted from coal to natural gas — are not coming back. Politicians and economists agree that what Appalachia really needs is  a diversified economy , a goal that has eluded Mr. Obama and state and local politicians. But in this land of staggering beauty and economic pain, Trump backers said over and over again that while coal might never be what it once was, the businessman they helped send to the White House could indeed put them back to work — if not in mining, then in some other industry. “I don’t think he can ever fulfill all the promises he made even in four or eight years,” Danny Maynard, 59, said after Bible study at the Chattaroy Missionary Baptist Church. Mr. Maynard lost his job at a coal company last year. “But I think we’re headed in the right direction,” he said. “He wants to make America great again.” Mr. Trump pummeled Mrs. Clinton in coal country. Here in West Virginia, he won every county and took  69 percent of the vote , a landslide also fueled by his promise to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices who would roll back abortion rights. As Mr. Copley put it, “Coal is secondary to me.” It is difficult for outsiders to fathom how deeply faith and work are intertwined here, or the economic and psychological depression that sets in when an entire region loses the only livelihood many of its people have ever known. Coal has always been boom and bust; its decline began long before Mr. Obama took office. But in West Virginia alone, 12,000 coal industry jobs have been lost during his tenure. At the Huddle House on Route 119, Kayla Burger, 32, a waitress, has worked three jobs since her husband lost his; they take home less than a quarter of the roughly $100,000 he used to earn. She took an offer for miners’ wives to train as phlebotomists, but with so many miners out of work, the phlebotomy market was flooded. She also substitute teaches and cooks at the school. They have given up cellphones and sold their boat; one car has been repossessed; the only reason they still have their house, she said, is that they saw layoffs coming and saved money. Her husband, who cares for the children, has experienced depression. “He doesn’t feel like a man,” Ms. Burger said. Her father was a miner, too; he and her mother drive tractor-trailers now. In Williamson — population roughly 3,100, down from 4,300 two decades ago — everyone has a story. The city used to market itself as “the heart of the billion-dollar coal fields,” but it now wraps its tourism pitches around the Hatfield-McCoy trails that run through the nearby mountains. (“We’re the 50-cent coal fields,” said Natalie Taylor, the executive director of the Tug Valley Chamber of Commerce.) Williamson’s downtown, on the border with eastern Kentucky, sits between the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River and the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks. At the newly opened pulmonary clinic here for patients with black lung disease, Patricia Sigmon, a respiratory therapist, has been caught in the trickle-down. With coal paying less in severance tax to the state, there is less funding for schools. Her husband, a school bus driver in nearby Boone County, was forced to take a $4,000 cut in pay. Larry Gannon, 61, retired early from his job as a coal processing plant foreman so that a younger man could keep his. Mr. Copley’s wife, Lauren, has a photography business, which is how they make do. They used to have “Cadillac” health coverage; now they have  Medicaid . So when scientists, and Democrats like Al Gore,  warn  that Mr. Trump will endanger the planet, people hear that as something off in the future; feeding your family is here and now. Many say Mother Nature will have her way. “When I was growing up, they said we were in an ice age,” said Kyle Lovern, the managing editor of  The Williamson Daily News . He voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and Mr. Trump this year. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in West Virginia, where anger at politicians has been building for years. Mr. Copley remembers the Democrats who held power here — men like Senator Robert C. Byrd, who died in 2010 and  whose name  is on buildings and roads built with the tax dollars he brought home — and wonders why they did not see the coal bust coming and work to diversify the economy. “We’re a forgotten people,” Ms. Taylor said, explaining why it did not take much for Mr. Trump to win coal country’s trust. “He mentions West Virginia, he mentions the coal workers, and that was pretty much all he had to do to seal this deal.” Now that the deal has been sealed, Mr. Trump has put a  climate change contrarian  and friend of the coal industry in charge of his Environmental Protection Agency transition team. Environmentalists are horrified, but Bill Raney, the president of the West Virginia Coal Association, a trade group, is thrilled. “Just a positive attitude in the White House is enormously important,” he said. While American utilities are shunning coal, Mr. Raney says, some mines are shipping coal overseas. He sees promise in clean coal technology and says that “some plants can get back on line” if Mr. Trump dismantles Mr. Obama’s Clean Power Plan. But that will take time. The plan is tied up in litigation; the Supreme Court was expected to hear the case next year. Mr. Copley, and many others, are waiting — and contemplating a divided nation. Mr. Copley is now a mini-celebrity here.  Yahoo News  declared that he had helped shape the race and invited his family to its studios in New York on election night. The family had never been to the city. Mr. Copley did not like having to explain to his children why anti-Trump protesters were shouting profanities in Times Square, and he later felt put off by the cast of “Hamilton” reading a statement he deemed “rude” to Mike Pence, the vice president-elect. At home, though, Mr. Copley sees nuance. His children’s drama teacher, Dusty Smith, 36, who has purple and blue streaks in her hair, said she had voted for Mr. Trump because he seemed “very humble” on  “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”  At the Thanksgiving play Ms. Smith directed, an African-American teenager delivered a spoken-word homage to racial harmony. Watching it, Mr. Copley worried that his black friends would think he was racist because of his vote. People have asked Mr. Copley if he will run for public office; if God leads him to, he said, he will. As for Mr. Trump, he will give the president-elect time: “He’s got four years.”',\n",

       " 'FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — It wasn’t quite Curt Schilling’s  bloody sock . It wasn’t Willis Reed’s  gimpy leg , either. But the injured right thumb of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was all that sports fans here could talk about in the days before New England played the Jacksonville Jaguars for the  A.F.C. championship  on Sunday. And for good reason. Not only has Brady been the team’s starting quarterback for nearly two decades, but he is perhaps the best quarterback of all time, having played in seven Super Bowls. His backup, Brian Hoyer, has one career playoff start, and would not inspire a fraction of the fear that Brady does. Patriots fans need not have worried, though Sunday’s game provided plenty of nail-biting moments. By his otherworldly standards, Brady put on a pedestrian performance, but it was enough for the Patriots in a 24-20 win over Jacksonville. Brady will now vie for his sixth Super Bowl title, and his third in four years, when the Patriots face   the Philadelphia Eagles  in Minneapolis on Feb. 4. A win in Minnesota would give the Patriots six Vince Lombardi trophies, tying them with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most of any team. Brady’s eighth trip to the Super Bowl will be three more than any other quarterback has made. (John Elway is in second place with five.) The Patriots have won all their titles during the last 16 years, when teams have had to juggle free agency, salary caps and longer seasons. That sets them apart from the New York Yankees of the 1950s, the Boston Celtics of the 1960s and the Chicago Bulls of the 1990s. The victories have not always been pretty, including the one on Sunday, when Brady had to engineer his record eighth fourth-quarter playoff comeback. For long parts of the game, the Jaguars appeared poised to pull off one of the bigger upsets in playoff history. The Patriots fell behind by 14-3 in the second quarter and played from behind for much of the game, struggling to establish their running game. They also lost their top receiver, tight end Rob Gronkowski, to a head injury in the second quarter. But Brady, who has also appeared in more playoff games than any other quarterback, once again led the Patriots with ruthless efficiency when it mattered most. Facing a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter, he engineered two scoring drives — aided by several Jaguars penalties — and put the Patriots ahead for good with less than three minutes remaining, when he hit wide receiver Danny Amendola with a 4-yard touchdown pass. “If you look up ‘good football player’ in the dictionary, his picture is right beside it,” Coach Bill Belichick said of Amendola. As they have done for years, Brady and Belichick did not buckle under pressure when trailing late. The Patriots’ defense provided the necessary support, stifling the Jaguars, blocking passes and rushing Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles in the second half. That left Brady, 40 years old and showing few signs of slowing down, with plenty of time on the clock. Showered several times by chants of “Brady, Brady” from the Gillette Stadium crowd, he completed 26 of 38 passes for 290 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. “When things start to crack a little bit, some teams haven’t had the same experience,” Patriots owner Robert K. Kraft said of the Jaguars, who have now played in three conference title games, losing all of them. The victory put to rest the drama of the previous few days. Brady hurt his thumb on Wednesday while handing off to running back Rex Burkhead during practice. He ended up with a sprained ligament and several stitches. After Kraft learned of the injury, he raced home from Florida. The Patriots were tight-lipped as usual. Brady did not speak to the news media on Wednesday or Thursday, and he did not practice those days. When he returned on Friday, Brady wore a glove and said only “we’ll see” when asked if he was confident that he would start on Sunday. “I’ve had a couple of crazy injuries, but this was pretty crazy,” Brady said after the game. “They come up and you just deal with them, and I wasn’t quite sure how I was going to do.” When he emerged for warm-ups on Sunday, it brought cheers from the early contingent of fans. He ran down the sideline wearing a white glove on his left hand and with black tape covering part of his right one. He then fist-bumped his coach, using the troublesome right hand, and started throwing passes to ball boys and receivers. “We’re not talking about open heart surgery here,” Belichick said with typical sarcasm after the game. Brady extinguished uncertainty on the opening drive, completing all six of his passes to four receivers. Perhaps in a concession to his injury, Brady often worked out of the shotgun and with an empty backfield — giving him more time and more receivers to target. Still, the Jaguars’ pass rushers were able to get to Brady, chasing him out of bounds and sacking him near the line of scrimmage. In what amounted to a minor victory for a visiting team at Gillette Stadium, the Jaguars held the Patriots to a field goal on that first drive. With Brady’s thumb no longer a mystery, the question was what Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles would do with his healthy throwing hand. The Jaguars kept things simple, handing the ball to the rookie running back Leonard Fournette, who had 76 yards rushing, and throwing short passes. Bortles (23 of 36 for 293 yards) drove the Jaguars down the field and hit tight end Marcedes Lewis for a 4-yard touchdown. The Jaguars pushed the lead to 14-3 after Fournette scored on a 4-yard run. They had a chance to pad their lead, but three penalties, including one that was declined, forced the them to punt with a little more than two minutes left in the first half. Brady made Jacksonville pay for those mistakes. For nearly two decades, fans here have watched him dissect opposing defenses. Before halftime, Brady hit Brandin Cooks, Amendola and running back James White. Jaguars safety Barry Church hit Gronkowski in the helmet while tackling him, leading to a 15-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness. Gronkowski did not return, but running back James White scored to close the gap to a far more comfortable 14-10. Keeping the Jaguars close was all Brady and his teammates needed.',\n",
       " 'In recent years, the movie musical has struggled for its complete resurrection as a genre, in efforts ranging from the Hollywood high-flown ( “Into the Woods” ) to the modest and quirky (Jeffrey St. Jules’s little-seen  “Bang Bang Baby,”  from 2014). And now, somewhere between the two, lies  “Hello Again,”  Tom Gustafson’s florid adaptation of  Michael John LaChiusa’s  1993 Off Broadway show (itself based on Arthur Schnitzler’s “La Ronde”). What most distinguishes “Hello Again” from the others is its cast of New York theater powerhouses, including Martha Plimpton, Audra McDonald and Cheyenne Jackson. “Hello Again” largely eschews dialogue as it leaps among historical eras and song sequences, depicting a series of fraught romantic encounters across decades. (Few film musicals have so teemed with non-graphic scenes of sexual acts.) It begins with a woman (Ms. Plimpton) who enters a peep-show-like chamber, seeking counsel about love from a mysterious masked man before her. And then it’s off to a coupling between a prostitute and a soldier in 1901; a tryst between a rich man (T. R. Knight) and a younger one on the Titanic; a 1920s affair in a movie theater involving an adulteress (Rumer Willis); a Greenwich Village disco hookup in the 1970s; and so on. The best comes near the end, when Ms. McDonald, as a singer in 2002 reaching for a comeback in a cheesy music video, puts Auto-Tune to shame. A later segment takes place in 1989, in which Ms. Plimpton plays a Washington senator keeping her lover (Ms. McDonald) a secret. Their scenes together are worth the price of admission. The movie benefits from Austin Schmidt’s neon-infused cinematography and Annie Simeone’s lush production design. But Mr. LaChiusa’s songs largely fail to resonate here. Dramatic traction suffers, probably as a result of the many, and diffuse, vignettes. And yet this is a commendably audacious effort by Mr. Gustafson ( “Were the World Mine” ). The movie musical needs more ambitious creators like him.',\n",

WRESTLING JERUSALEM  Aaron Davidman’s  Off Broadway one-man show  about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lives on as a movie. DAYVEON  In a small Arkansas town, a young teenager (Devin Blackmon) is drawn to the excitement of gang life, which tests his loyalty. The first-time feature director Amman Abbasi is said to have consulted actual gang members for accuracy. EX LIBRIS — THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY  A tireless chronicler of American institutions, Frederick Wiseman, now 87, documents the inner workings of one of the world’s largest and most recognizable library systems, where even phone operators are handy with Middle English, and the photo file is so detailed that it contains a folder of “dogs in action.” AGAINST THE NIGHT  Among the places you might not want to go on late-night excursions with your friends, “abandoned prisons” rank roughly third, behind only “haunted abandoned prisons” and “haunted abandoned prisons once run by wardens who turned their inmates into biochemical test subjects.” AMERICAN ASSASSIN  A veteran C.I.A. officer (Michael Keaton) takes a vengeful rookie (Dylan O’Brien) under his wing; together, the kid and his mentor unravel an international plot. Sanaa Lathan, Shiva Negar and Taylor Kitsch also star in this adaptation of Vince Flynn’s best seller. Michael Cuesta directed. BRAD’S STATUS  Ben Stiller’s Brad, who works for a nonprofit, is forced to confront his self-perceived mediocrity after a college visit to Boston with his son (Austin Abrams) makes him jealous of his own former college pals’ success. Michael Sheen, Luke Wilson, Jemaine Clement and Mike White play his high-rolling chums. Mr. White, best known for his screenplay for “School of Rock,” wrote and directed. EASY LIVING  Adam Keleman’s debut feature is not a remake of the Jean Arthur comedy classic from 1937, written by Preston Sturges, but it does concern old movies, or at least a door-to-door saleswoman (Caroline Dhavernas) who finds them inspirational. EMBARGO  A documentary examines the history of the United States’ embargo against Cuba, making the case that the policy has been bad for both countries. EXTRAORDINARY ORDINARY PEOPLE  As part of a decades-spanning project, the filmmaker and arts advocate Alan Govenar profiles winners of the National Heritage Fellowship, an award given to traditional and folk artists by the National Endowment for the Arts. FIRST THEY KILLED MY FATHER  Angelina Jolie directs this adaptation of Loung Ung’s  memoir  of her Cambodian childhood under the Khmer Rouge. Ms. Jolie’s process for casting the young Loung, as  described in Vanity Fair , struck critics as exploitative; Ms. Jolie responded that her quotations had been taken out of context, but the magazine stood by the article. THE FUTURE PERFECT  A prizewinner at last year’s Locarno Festival, Nele Wohlatz’s debut feature blends fiction and documentary as it follows a Chinese teenager in Argentina. INDIVISIBLE  Conjoined twin singers in southern Italy weigh whether to be separated. Edoardo De Angelis directed. MANOLO: THE BOY WHO MADE SHOES FOR LIZARDS  Manolo Blahnik, the designer of elegant shoes for women, gets a film profile, courtesy of  the fashion editor Michael Roberts , who is making his first movie. MOTHER!  In Darren Aronofsky’s first feature since “Noah” — remember that? — he’s returning to the mind games of “Black Swan.” Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem receive unexpected guests (Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer) at their home. RAT FILM  Theo Anthony’s inventive, multifaceted docu-essay draws parallels between the history of rodent extermination, which reached milestones at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and the history of racism and redlining in that city. You’ll learn about the proper height of trash cans and watch desperate residents as they take rat- catching into their own hands — with fishing rods. RED TREES  The London-based, Brazilian-born filmmaker Marina Willer delves into the history of her family, Jews in Prague during World War II. RYDE  It was only a matter of time before the ride-sharing industry begot its own horror movie. Ryde is the movie’s version of Uber or Lyft. In this case, the driver is replaced by a psychopath. STRONG ISLAND  Yance Ford takes us on a fragmented personal and nonchronological journey through his family history, pivoting on the events surrounding his brother’s shooting death at a Long Island auto shop in 1992. TIME TO DIE  First shown in 1966 but never released in the United States, the Mexican director Arturo Ripstein’s debut feature, with a screenplay by Gabriel García Márquez and Carlos Fuentes, is a western: A man imprisoned for murder returns home, where the prospect of settling down is complicated, and the victim’s sons want revenge. VENGEANCE: A LOVE STORY  It sounds more like “Vengeance: A ‘Death Wish’ Knock-Off.” Nicolas Cage plays a detective who goes well beyond the bounds of his authority when the rapists of a single mother (Anna Hutchison) are acquitted with the help of a smarmy lawyer (Don Johnson). WETLANDS  On the outskirts of Atlantic City, a detective (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) with a fraught past tries to get his life back on track. Heather Graham and Jennifer Ehle also star. THE WILDE WEDDING  Glenn Close stars as a retired actress who is no  Norma Desmond : As she prepares for her fourth marriage (to Patrick Stewart, with hair), she is the center of a family gathering that includes an ex-husband (John Malkovich, without hair) and other potential sources of wackiness (Minnie Driver, Grace Van Patten, Noah Emmerich and Peter Facinelli).

THIRST STREET  An American flight attendant (Lindsay Burdge) has a fling with a Frenchman (Damien Bonnard), only to have his ex-girlfriend (Esther Garrel) turn up, in the latest psychological whirlwind from Nathan Silver (“Stinking Heaven”). Mr. Silver wrote it with C. Mason Wells, a programmer at the Quad Cinema in the West Village, where the movie is opening. HISSEIN HABRÉ, A CHADIAN TRAGEDY  The Chadian director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun turns to documentary for a portrait of the survivors of the regime of Hissène Habré, who was president of Chad from 1982 to 1990 and who in 2016  was convicted  of torture and crimes against humanity. BATTLE OF THE SEXES  Two experts at serving one-liners — Emma Stone and Steve Carell — turn to serving tennis balls in this light docudrama from Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (“Little Miss Sunshine”). The movie recreates the 1973 exhibition match between Billie Jean King (Ms. Stone) and Bobby Riggs (Mr. Carell), which became a kind of cultural symbol in the fight for gender equality. BOBBI JENE  The winner of the best documentary award at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival, Elvira Lind’s film follows the dancer Bobbi Jene Smith after she leaves the Batsheva Dance Company. BOSTON  Matt Damon narrates this documentary about the history of the Boston Marathon, including the bombings in 2013. ELIZABETH BLUE  Anna Schafer stars as a woman who grapples with mental illness as she prepares to marry her fiancé (Ryan Vincent). Kathleen Quinlan also stars. The writer and director, Vincent Sabella, has said he based some of the film on his own experiences living with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. THE FORCE  For this documentary, the director Peter Nicks followed the Oakland Police Department in California over two years, a period that included a  series of high-ranking departures  in the wake of departmental scandals. GAGA: FIVE FOOT TWO  That’s Lady Gaga, filmed behind the scenes over eight months. How many other 5-foot-2 Gagas do you know? HONG KONG TRILOGY: PRESCHOOLED, PREOCCUPIED, PREPOSTEROUS  The cinematographer Christopher Doyle — who collaborated with Wong Kar-wai on some of that filmmaker’s most stunning movies — directs three short works that blend documentary and fiction and focus on different generations in Hong Kong at a time of transition and pro-democracy protests. THE HOUSES OCTOBER BUILT 2  This is a sequel to a  2014 found-footage horror film  in which five friends visited haunted houses. THE KING’S CHOICE  In 1940, King Haakon VII of Norway refused to surrender to the invading German Army. The director Erik Poppe captures him at the critical juncture of his decision. Jesper Christensen plays the king. KINGSMAN: THE GOLDEN CIRCLE  The bespectacled superspies and their impeccably tailored suits return for a sequel to the  2015 adaptation  of the comic book The Secret Service. Matthew Vaughn’s follow-up serves at least one good cause — keeping Julianne Moore employed, here as a villain — and also stars Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Channing Tatum, Colin Firth, Halle Berry and Elton John (?!). LAST RAMPAGE  The director Dwight H. Little (“Murder at 1600”) dramatizes the 1978 prison escape of two men (Robert Patrick and Chris Browning) in Arizona and the  murders that followed . With Heather Graham and Bruce Davison. THE LEGO NINJAGO MOVIE  If you can build it with Legos, you can build a movie around it. Following “The Lego Movie” and “The Lego Batman Movie,” this latest spinoff is inspired by Lego’s current ninja-themed line. Dave Franco provides the voice of a school-age ninja who challenges his father (Justin Theroux), an evil warlord. Jackie Chan is his sensei; Fred Armisen, Abbi Jacobson, Olivia Munn and Kumail Nanjiani lend their vocal talents, too. LOVING VINCENT  Armand Roulin (voiced by Douglas Booth), who sat for Vincent van Gogh, sets out to investigate why the artist committed suicide. This biopic is billed as the first animated feature to be constructed completely from oil paintings, which are done in van Gogh’s style. The voice cast also includes Chris O’Dowd and Saoirse Ronan. SHOT  A sound mixer (Noah Wyle) is shot by a stray bullet; the film contrasts his medical ordeal with the actions of the penitent teenager (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) who shot him. Sharon Leal plays the wife of Mr. Wyle’s character. STRONGER  David Gordon Green, a long way from his indie roots (“George Washington,” “All the Real Girls”), dramatizes the true story of  Jeff Bauman  (Jake Gyllenhaal), who lost both of his legs in the Boston Marathon bombing. Tatiana Maslany stars as his love interest, and Miranda Richardson as his mother. THE TIGER HUNTER  An Indian tiger hunter’s son (Danny Pudi, from “Community”), having emigrated to Chicago, puts on a charade to pretend he’s more successful than he is when the woman he loves pays a visit. This feature, Lena Khan’s first, is set in 1979. UNREST  When Jennifer Brea, a Harvard doctoral student, was struck with chronic fatigue syndrome, she started a video diary that grew into this documentary. VICTORIA & ABDUL  Victoria is Queen Victoria, played by — who else? — Judi Dench. Abdul (Ali Fazal) is the clerk who travels to England to furnish her with a ceremonial coin. Stephen Frears, already familiar with British royalty from “The Queen” (2006), chronicles the resulting friendship. WELCOME TO WILLITS  Campers who travel to a marijuana-growing part of Northern California stumble into a town prone to visits from aliens, who are not so chill. The cast includes Dolph Lundgren, Rory Culkin and Karrueche Tran. WOODSHOCK  The fashion designer sisters Kate and Laura Mulleavy wrote and directed this impressionistic debut feature, which stars Kirsten Dunst as a woman who, while grieving and undergoing an unconventional drug treatment, descends into what looks like madness. Depression onscreen is familiar territory for Ms. Dunst, who went down a similar rabbit hole in Lars von Trier’s “Melancholia.” BUGS  In last year’s “City of Gold,” the food critics Ruth Reichl and Jonathan Gold agreed that eating insects would ultimately be necessary for the human race to survive. In Andreas Johnsen’s documentary, the gourmands at the Nordic Food Lab in Denmark get in on the ground floor and dine with insect foodies from around the globe. CLIVE DAVIS: THE SOUNDTRACK OF OUR LIVES  The music producer and Arista Records founder recounts his career and is dished about by many of the artists whose careers he influenced, including Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin, Patti Smith, Barry Manilow, Alicia Keys and (presumably in archival footage) Whitney Houston. I AM ANOTHER YOU  After meeting a man who is a drifter, seemingly by choice, in Florida, the Chinese documentarian Nanfu Wang (“Hooligan Sparrow”) followed him across the United States. This documentary, which showed at South by Southwest and BAMcinemaFest, explores the contradictions of his lifestyle. ABUNDANT ACREAGE AVAILABLE  Amy Ryan and Terry Kinney star as siblings who return to the family farm to bury their father — only to meet three brothers whose family owned the farm before them. Angus MacLachlan (who wrote the screenplay for “Junebug”) wrote and directed. AMERICAN MADE  Tom Cruise already played a cocky fighter pilot in “Top Gun” and hung from a plane by his fingertips in “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation.” Mr. Cruise’s next feat in hotshot aviation? Starring as Barry Seal, a pilot who  claimed to have made  more than $50 million smuggling drugs, and ultimately served as a witness for the federal government before being killed. In this loose version of events from Mr. Cruise’s “Edge of Tomorrow” director, Doug Liman, Seal also works for the C.I.A. Domhnall Gleeson, Sarah Wright and Benito Martinez all figure into his antics. BLOOD STRIPE  A sergeant (Kate Nowlin) returns home from Afghanistan and experiences psychological aftereffects. Remy Auberjonois, the son of the character actor Rene Auberjonois, directed the film, and wrote it with Ms. Nowlin, his wife. FLATLINERS  Evidently none of the characters in this reimagining was cool enough to watch Joel Schumacher’s “Flatliners,” the 1990 hit that featured Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon as medical students who took turns stopping one another’s hearts. Had they watched it, they might have learned that it wasn’t a great idea. Ellen Page, Diego Luna, Nina Dobrev, Kiersey Clemons and James Norton play the new class, and Mr. Sutherland is back, but in a different role. Niels Arden Oplev (the original “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo”) directed. HEARTSTONE  It’s summer in Iceland, and while one teenage boy chases a girl, another begins to fall for that boy, his longtime best friend. Gudmundur Arnar Gudmundsson directs. JUDWAA 2  In this remake of the 1997 comedy “Judwaa,” the Bollywood heartthrob Varun Dhawan plays separated identical twins who are psychically linked — what happens to one affects the other. And then they meet. LITERALLY, RIGHT BEFORE AARON  It’s Adam (Justin Long) who was, literally or figuratively, the boyfriend right before Aaron (Ryan Hansen), the man Allison (Cobie Smulders), Adam’s ex, is about to marry. To make things truly awkward, she invites Adam to the wedding. The actor Ryan Eggold wrote and directed. LUCKY  No stranger to America’s wide-open spaces after his work with David Lynch, Wim Wenders and countless others, Harry Dean Stanton stars as a 90-year-old living in a desert town looking for meaning in his life. John Carroll Lynch (Arthur Leigh Allen in “Zodiac”) directed. David Lynch himself is in the cast. MARK FELT — THE MAN WHO BROUGHT DOWN THE WHITE HOUSE  From the moment Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein had the rug pulled out from under them with the  revelation of Deep Throat’s identity  in 2005, a biopic of the man who blew the whistle on Watergate was probably inevitable. Liam Neeson stars as their anonymous source, W. Mark Felt,  the No. 2 man at the F.B.I. , who helped sink Nixon’s presidency. Peter Landesman (“Parkland,” which revolved around the John F. Kennedy assassination) directed. OUR SOULS AT NIGHT  Reunited from “The Chase,” “Barefoot in the Park” and “The Electric Horseman,” Robert Redford and Jane Fonda star as widowed neighbors who grow close in this adaptation of  Kent Haruf’s final novel . Ritesh Batra directed. THE PATHOLOGICAL OPTIMIST  For this documentary, the director Miranda Bailey trailed Andrew Wakefield, the lead author of a widely discredited 1998 study — since  retracted  by the journal that published it, The Lancet — that claimed a link between vaccines and autism. He subsequently lost his medical license but became a significant figure in the anti-vaccine movement his work initiated. The film followed him for five years, beginning in 2011. PEARL JAM: LET’S PLAY TWO  Fans of the Chicago Cubs eager to relive last year’s championship season would probably prioritize the nail-biter that was  Game 7 . But for anyone whose favorite part was Pearl Jam, here’s a concert film that goes behind the scenes with Eddie Vedder during Pearl Jam’s performances at Wrigley Field in August 2016. A QUESTION OF FAITH  A car accident links three families. Richard T. Jones, Kim Fields and C. Thomas Howell star. REALIVE  The Spanish director Mateo Gil (who has collaborated with Alejandro Amenábar on scripts for films like “Open Your Eyes”) wrote and directed this science-fiction film about a man (Tom Hughes) with a terminal disease who is cryogenically frozen and then awakened in 2084 after 60 years of limbo. Charlotte Le Bon and Oona Chaplin co-star. THE SOUND  Rose McGowan plays an acoustics expert who discredits rumors of the paranormal. (It’s a living.) But a “ghost station” — an abandoned subway stop — may just have her stumped. Christopher Lloyd also stars in this horror film, directed by Jenna Mattison. SUPER DARK TIMES  An accidental death begins to fray at the relationship of best friends (Owen Campbell and Charlie Tahan) in upstate New York. This coming-of-age drama-thriller is set in the 1990s. CHAVELA  Catherine Gund and Daresha Kyi directed this documentary portrait of  Chavela Vargas , a singer known for ranchera music andpopular recordings of beloved Mexican songs. ASSHOLES  The title refers to two relapsed addicts who meet cute in a therapist’s waiting room. Peter Vack (an actor on “Mozart in the Jungle”) makes his feature directorial debut. BARRACUDA  A Texas woman (Allison Tolman) grapples with the fallout from the arrival of her unknown half sister (Sophie Reid). BENDING THE ARC  This documentary looks at the work of three advocates, including Jim Yong Kim, a doctor and the president of the World Bank, who developed strategies for combating AIDS and Ebola, among other diseases, in impoverished countries. BETTER WATCH OUT  A babysitter (Olivia DeJonge) forgets to include home invaders in her hourly rate. BLADE RUNNER 2049  No, Ridley Scott hasn’t recut “Blade Runner” again. This is a sequel to his 1982 film, which wrote the rules for modern sci-fi noir. Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”) directed, and Harrison Ford returns as Deckard. (If the movie is set 30 years after the first film, and he’s still alive, does that mean he’s not a replicant?) Ryan Gosling, as a Los Angeles police officer, is the lead. Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks and Robin Wright also star. BRAWL IN CELL BLOCK 99  S. Craig Zahler, who made the excellent, underseen western  “Bone Tomahawk,”  directs Vince Vaughn as a former boxer who winds up in the slammer after serving as a drug courier. Don Johnson (of course) and Udo Kier (why not?) are also in the cast. THE DEATH AND LIFE OF MARSHA P. JOHNSON  Ms. Johnson was a drag queen and transgender activist who was present at the Stonewall riots and whose death in 1992, under suspicious circumstances, was ruled a suicide. This documentary, directed by David France (“How to Survive a Plague”), is “both a true-crime mystery and an elegy for the old West Village,” Mike Hale  wrote  in The New York Times when it screened at the Tribeca Film Festival. DEMENTIA 13  Sure, everything seems to be rebooted these days, but was anyone expecting a remake of the 1963 horror film “Dementia 13,” arguably Francis Ford Coppola’s first feature (discounting his apprentice work for Roger Corman and soft-core films)? Who knows — maybe Richard LeMay, who directed, will be the next Coppola. DINA  Dan Sickles and Antonio Santini’s well-liked documentary follows Dina, who is on the autism spectrum, and her boyfriend, Scott, a Walmart greeter, as the two prepare to marry. The movie won the top American documentary prize at the Sundance Film Festival. EARTH: ONE AMAZING DAY  Richard Dale, Peter Webber and Fan Lixin directed this sequel to the 2009 nature documentary “Earth,” which Jeannette Catsoulis  described  in The Times as “nature defanged and declawed for kiddie consumption.” FACES PLACES  For her latest personal essay and travelogue in the vein of “The Gleaners and I,” the French new wave legend Agnès Varda has shared directing and M.C.-ing duties with the French street artist JR. Over the course of a road trip, as they reflect on French culture and camaraderie, he comes to seem like a natural successor to her sensibility. The movie garnered almost universal acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival in May. THE FLORIDA PROJECT  Sean Baker makes movies about “unseen” communities in plain sight: transgender prostitutes and cabdrivers in Los Angeles (“Tangerine”), say, or the world of pornographic filmmaking in “Starlet.” An unlikely crowd-pleaser, “The Florida Project” is centered on a seedy motel near Disney World, where Mr. Baker’s 6-year-old heroine (the exuberant Brooklynn Prince) lives jubilantly, despite poverty and squalid surroundings. THE ISLANDS AND THE WHALES  The residents of the Faroe Islands, between Scotland and Iceland, find that the whales so central to their way of life have been contaminated by pollution. MAINELAND  Miao Wang’s documentary trails two Chinese teenagers who move to the United States to attend private high schools in Maine. THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN US  In a big change of pace, the Palestinian filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad (“Omar,” “Paradise Now”) directs Kate Winslet and Idris Elba in a survival picture. The two play strangers who, in their desperation to get where they want to go, charter a plane that crashes in remote mountains. MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE  If you can hear this title without getting a theme song stuck in your head, consider yourself lucky. If you can take your kids to this without being pressed into watching the television series (or buying the toys on which it’s based), consider yourself luckier. Uzo Aduba, Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Taye Diggs, Michael Peña and Sia provide some of the voices. OVERDRIVE  Scott Eastwood — yes, there’s a familial resemblance to his famous father, Clint Eastwood — and Freddie Thorp star as ace car thieves who are blackmailed into stealing a car from the nemesis of a crime kingpin. Ana de Armas also stars in the movie, which looks like a calculated appeal to fans of “The Fast and the Furious.” PARADISE  Andrei Konchalovsky (“Runaway Train”) directed this Holocaust story, shot in black and white, about a Russian woman in the French Resistance and a German officer she knows from before the war. SO B. IT  Stephen Gyllenhaal, Jake and Maggie’s father, directed this adaptation of Sarah Weeks’s  young-adult novel  about a 12-year-old (Talitha Bateman) who goes on a journey to discover why her mother knows fewer than two dozen words. It also stars Alfre Woodard, Cloris Leachman and John Heard (in one of his last roles). SURVIVING PEACE  With interviews from both sides of the conflict, this documentary proposes solutions for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. TAKE EVERY WAVE: THE LIFE OF LAIRD HAMILTON   Mr. Hamilton , a titan of surfing, is profiled by the documentarian Rory Kennedy (“Last Days in Vietnam”). TAKE MY NOSE … PLEASE!  The journalist Joan Kron, making her first documentary, looks back at how female comedians have lifted a shroud of secrecy from the pressures on women to elect plastic surgery. TRAFFICKED  This drama follows three women from three countries who are imprisoned as sex slaves in Texas. Ashley Judd, Anne Archer and Elisabeth Röhm are in the cast. UNA  In a screen version of David Harrower’s play “Blackbird” — which ran Off Broadway with Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill and, a decade later, on Broadway with Mr. Daniels and Michelle Williams — Ben Mendelsohn and Rooney Mara play a middle-aged man and the woman with whom he had an illegal sexual relationship when she was a girl, who confronts him 15 years later. WALKING OUT  Alex and Andrew J. Smith (“The Slaughter Rule”), chroniclers of their native Montana, direct this lean survivalist film about a father and son (Matt Bomer and Josh Wiggins) whose rare time together turns harrowing after complications on a hunting trip. Bill Pullman appears in flashbacks, and Lily Gladstone (“Certain Women”) turns up briefly. 78/52: HITCHCOCK’S SHOWER SCENE  You might call Alexandre O. Philippe’s documentary a behind-the-scenes portrait — except that it’s more like a behind-the-scene portrait, a feature-length examination of the moment of Marion Crane’s death in “Psycho” from technical, historical and theoretical angles. You’ll learn a lot even if you know the movie well. ALEX & EVE  This Australian comedy is being promoted as the antipodean “My Big Fat Greek Wedding,” except this time it’s the groom who’s Greek, and the woman he hopes to marry is a Lebanese Muslim. BREATHE  Andy Serkis, perhaps tired of hiding behind special effects in the “Planet of the Apes” and “Lord of the Rings” movies, hides instead in the director’s chair. His debut feature tells the story of Robin Cavendish (Andrew Garfield), a British man who became an advocate for the disabled after polio paralyzed him. Claire Foy plays Cavendish’s wife, Diana. THE DEPARTURE  Lana Wilson (a director of “After Tiller”) films a profile of Ittetsu Nemoto, an erstwhile punk rocker and Buddhist priest who offers support for the suicidal. FOR AHKEEM  Documentarians trail Daje Shelton, a teenager in an impoverished section of St. Louis, through her high school years. THE FOREIGNER  Jackie Chan plays a man who wants answers after his daughter is killed in a bombing. He thinks that a politician with a past in the Irish Republican Army (Pierce Brosnan, made up so that he bears a striking resemblance to Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein) knows who’s responsible. Martin Campbell (“Casino Royale”) directed. GNOME ALONE  After moving into a new house, a girl discovers that the garden gnomes are alive — and guarding the entrance to another dimension. It sounds like something out of David Lynch, but it’s an animated feature from Peter Lepeniotis (“The Nut Job”) and Shelly Shenoy. GOODBYE CHRISTOPHER ROBIN  J. M. Barrie had “Finding Neverland.” Now A. A. Milne, the creator of Winnie-the-Pooh, gets a biopic that delves into the sources of inspiration for the Hundred Acre Wood. Domhnall Gleeson plays Milne; Margot Robbie portrays his wife; and Will Tilston plays his son, the real Christopher Robin. Simon Curtis (“My Week With Marilyn”) directed. HAPPY DEATH DAY  In “Groundhog Day,” fate gave Bill Murray a chance to repeat a bad day and turn it into a good one. “Happy Death Day” — about a college student (Jessica Rothe) who continually relives the day she is murdered — puts a grimmer spin on that premise. HUMAN FLOW  Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist and activist, directed this two-hour-20-minute look at refugee crises and human migration in 23 countries. MARSHALL  Chadwick Boseman stars as Thurgood Marshall in a biopic set more than a decade before Marshall’s landmark arguments before the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education. As a lawyer in his early 30s working for the N.A.A.C.P., he defends a Connecticut chauffeur accused of  rape and attempted murder . Josh Gad, Sterling K. Brown and Kate Hudson also star. Reginald Hudlin directed. THE MEYEROWITZ STORIES (NEW AND SELECTED)  Dysfunctional families aren’t exactly new territory for Noah Baumbach, but this bittersweet and often just plain bitter comedy about three siblings (Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller and Elizabeth Marvel), healing old wounds and dealing with their cantankerous father (Dustin Hoffman), got a warm reception at Cannes in May. With Grace Van Patten and, in a bit of counterintuitive casting, Emma Thompson. MONOGAMISH  After his divorce from the actress Olivia Wilde, Tao Ruspoli (a son of  an Italian prince , Alessandro Ruspoli) delved into a documentary investigation of marriage and monogamy. PROFESSOR MARSTON & THE WONDER WOMEN  A  handful of critics  complained that this summer’s “Wonder Woman” lacked the original comic’s kinkiness. For that, Angela Robinson’s biopic tells the story of Wonder Woman’s creator, a psychologist who maintained a hidden life with his wife (Rebecca Hall) and their lover (Bella Heathcote). TE ATA  Q’orianka Kilcher (“The New World”) plays Mary Thompson Fisher, known as Te Ata, a Chickasaw performer whose celebrated career included appearances before Franklin D. Roosevelt. Graham Greene and Gil Birmingham also star. THY FATHER’S CHAIR  Orthodox Jewish twins who have been hoarders for years are pressed by a tenant into cleaning out their home, which prompts a reckoning with their past and their future. Antonio Tibaldi and Alex Lora made this direct-cinema-style documentary. TOM OF FINLAND  Pekka Strang stars as Touko Laaksonen, a Finnish advertising designer who, starting in the 1950s, had a sideline in making pornographic drawings that  depicted various forms of aggrandized masculinity . He became a notable figure in the art world and in gay culture. WASTED! THE STORY OF FOOD WASTE  The celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain leads this exploration of food sustainability, and of how leftover parts can be transformed into gourmet meals. L’ENFANT SECRET  This 1979 film by Philippe Garrel (“I Can No Longer Hear the Guitar”) will receive its first run in the United States, following a showing at the New York Film Festival and a retrospective of that French auteur’s work at the Metrograph in New York. And like many of his films, the semi-autobiographical movie charts the disintegration of a relationship. (Anne Wiazemsky and Henri de Maublanc play the couple.) LIBERATION DAY  North Korea doesn’t get many visits from Slovenian industrial-rock musicians. This documentary follows what happened when the band Laibach received an invitation to perform there. THE PARIS OPERA  Frederick Wiseman already went behind the scenes of the  Paris Opera Ballet . Jean-Stéphane Bron filmed this in-depth examination of the broader opera company, during a period that included the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. BPM (BEATS PER MINUTE)  Robin Campillo, a regular screenwriting collaborator of Laurent Cantet’s (“The Class”), took the Grand Prix at Cannes, the equivalent of second place, for this powerful look at AIDS activists in Paris in the early 1990s, with a focus on protests and strategy. DEALT  Luke Korem directs this documentary portrait of Richard Turner, a card magician who happens to be blind. GEOSTORM  The solution to global warming, as depicted in this science-fiction blockbuster bid, is to build a system of satellites that can control Earth’s weather. That sounds like a great idea — until the system goes haywire. Dean Devlin, a frequent writer and producer on Roland Emmerich’s movies (“Independence Day,” the 1998 “Godzilla”), orchestrates the mayhem. With Gerard Butler, Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish and Andy Garcia. JUNGLE  Daniel Radcliffe and other explorers get lost in the Amazonian jungle, a bind from which no Hogwarts-style magic will save them. KILLING GUNTHER  Political precedents are broken all the time, but for now, Arnold Schwarzenegger stands as the only former governor of California to star as a bespectacled, wisecracking hit man who becomes the target of other hit people. The “Saturday Night Live” veteran Taran Killam wrote and directed. He also stars, alongside Cobie Smulders and Allison Tolman. LEATHERFACE  It’s odd to call the release of a prequel to “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre” a bittersweet event, but that’s the case with this origin story for Leatherface, arriving just a few months after the  death of Tobe Hooper , the director of the 1974 original. NEVER HERE  Mireille Enos (“The Killing”) plays an artist whose lover sees a murder. The problem is, his testimony would reveal who he is, so she pretends she was the witness. Sam Shepard (who  died in July ), Goran Visnjic and Nina Arianda also star. NIGHTWORLD  A former police officer moves from Los Angeles to Bulgaria, where, as a security officer, he discovers a haunted building, as one does. ONLY THE BRAVE  Josh Brolin stars as the leader of the Granite Mountain Hotshots — wildfire specialists called “the Seal Team 6 of firefighters” in the trailer — in a portrait of the group’s bravery, based on a GQ magazine article. Nineteen of the 20-member team died fighting a wildfire in the Southwest in 2013. Joseph Kosinski (“Tron: Legacy”) directed. ONE OF US  The documentarians Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady (“Detropia,” “Jesus Camp”) capture three years in the lives of three Hasidic New Yorkers who have left their ultra-Orthodox communities. SAME KIND OF DIFFERENT AS ME  Greg Kinnear plays an art dealer who finds his life transformed by a friendship with a homeless man (Djimon Hounsou). With Renée Zellweger and Jon Voight. THE SNOWMAN  Scary: A serial killer who went silent becomes active again. Possibly not as scary: The killer strikes at snowfall and leaves snowmen as calling cards. Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson investigate. Tomas Alfredson (“Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy”) directed this adaptation of a best seller by Jo Nesbo. TEMPESTAD  Tatiana Huezo’s documentary tells the stories of two women in Mexico, one who was accused of human trafficking, and another whose daughter went missing. TRAGEDY GIRLS  Alexandra Shipp and Brianna Hildebrand star as internet sleuths who catch the killer they’ve been investigating — then decide to continue his spree for the clicks. With Josh Hutcherson and Craig Robinson. TYLER PERRY’S BOO 2! A MADEA HALLOWEEN  Tyler Perry puts on his grandma outfit yet again, but this is the first time she’s had to deal with actual Halloween monsters. WHERE’S THE MONEY  To retrieve stolen money, a black student (the comedian Andrew Bachelor) at the University of Southern California rushes a very white fraternity. WONDERSTRUCK  Todd Haynes’s magical adaptation of a book by Brian Selznick alternates between two timelines as it charts the parallel journeys of two children in New York. In 1927 — a strand told in the style of a black-and-white silent film — a deaf girl (Millicent Simmonds) searches for a movie star (Julianne Moore). In 1977, a boy (Oakes Fegley) who has become deaf in an electrical storm seeks his father. THE WORK  A group with the goal of rehabilitating prisoners enters Folsom State Prison in California for a four-day exercise in this documentary. GOD’S OWN COUNTRY  Francis Lee’s drama, which drew acclaim at Sundance, concerns a farmer in Northern England who falls for a Romanian migrant worker. Josh O’Connor and Alec Secareanu star. AIDA’S SECRETS  Alon Schwarz’s documentary concerns the reunion of two brothers, who were separated in infancy, and their mother. ALL I SEE IS YOU  Pulling a gender swap on the Val Kilmer–Mira Sorvino vehicle “At First Sight,” this film from Marc Forster (“World War Z”) casts Blake Lively as a woman who, having been blinded in her youth, regains sight in one eye, thanks to an operation. It turns out that her husband (Jason Clarke) isn’t the man of her dreams. BILL NYE: SCIENCE GUY  Once the host of a slightly goofy educational children’s show, Bill Nye has become a highly visible advocate for scientific thinking for adults, particularly on evolution and global warming. David Alvarado and Jason Sussberg directed this documentary profile. BRIMSTONE & GLORY  Dreams catch fire, literally, at the National Pyrotechnic Festival in Tultepec, Mexico. The celebration, its participants and the tradition of firework-making are the subjects of Viktor Jakovleski’s documentary. CRASH PAD  Domhnall Gleeson discovers that the woman he’s been having an affair with (Christina Applegate) is just using him to get revenge on her husband (Thomas Haden Church). The husband gets revenge on her by moving into Mr. Gleeson’s man cave. Nina Dobrev also stars; the veteran editor Kevin Tent (who has worked with Alexander Payne) directed. THE DIVINE ORDER  This Swiss comedy from Petra Volpe was a prizewinner at the Tribeca Film Festival. In a cloistered Swiss village in 1971, a housewife (Marie Leuenberger) picks up the torch for women’s liberation; the movement she starts jolts the conservative populace. FÉLICITÉ  The filmmaker Alain Gomis, who will bring his first feature to the New York Film Festival this fall, directed this story of a singer (Véro Tshanda Beya Mputu) in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, who desperately needs money to pay for her injured son’s recovery. JIGSAW  Jigsaw died long ago, it seemed, and his copycats have been quiet since “Saw 3D” in 2010. But what if — hear us out — he didn’t actually die? Or there’s another copycat? One of these things will prove true in the resurrection of a truly unkillable franchise. JOAN DIDION: THE CENTER WILL NOT HOLD  The actor Griffin Dunne (“After Hours”) directed this profile of one of his aunts — who happens to be Joan Didion. She discusses contemporary life, her career and the loss of her husband and daughter. THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER  Winner of a screenwriting prize at Cannes, this warped blend of horror film and morality play from Yorgos Lanthimos (“The Lobster”) stars Colin Farrell as a cardiologist and Barry Keoghan (“Dunkirk”) as an ingratiating boy who knows something about his past. Nicole Kidman plays the wife of Mr. Farrell’s character. MAYA DARDEL  Lena Olin plays an author who starts a rather ghoulish competition: After declaring on the radio that she will end her life, she invites male writers to vie to become executor of her estate. Zachary Cotler and Magdalena Zyzak wrote and directed. MR. ROOSEVELT  Noël Wells (“Master of None”) wrote, directed and stars in her debut feature, playing a comedian who returns from Los Angeles to Austin, Tex., and finds that her world there has changed. NOVITIATE  Maggie Betts directs this powerful film about a young woman (Margaret Qualley, from “The Leftovers”) who decides to become a nun after attending Roman Catholic school. Sort of a “Full Metal Habit,” the movie chronicles her initiation into convent life, which coincides with the Vatican II reforms. Melissa Leo plays the vindictive mother superior. Dianna Agron and Morgan Saylor also star. THE SQUARE  “Force Majeure” already brought the Swedish director Ruben Ostlund international attention (especially after a  YouTube video , possibly tongue-in-cheek, showed him melting down while watching the Oscar nominations). “The Square,” which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, takes his satirical ideas about masculinity, hypocrisy and the social contract to a new level. Claes Bang plays a museum curator whose ideals don’t always match his actions. Elisabeth Moss appears as an American journalist, and the motion-capture coach Terry Notary has a memorable wordless turn. STOIC  After his wife and daughter are killed, a lawyer (Antonio Banderas) steels himself for vengeance. Isaac Florentine directed. SUBURBICON  The brothers Joel and Ethan Coen are among the screenwriters for this feature, set in 1959, but George Clooney, who directed, has  said  that the movie, contrary to appearances, is not a comedy. Matt Damon plays a father figure who gives in to darker impulses after his wife (Julianne Moore, playing sisters) is murdered in a Levittown-like suburb being convulsed by racial violence. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE  Miles Teller plays a returning Iraq war veteran reacclimating to civilian life. With Haley Bennett and Amy Schumer. Jason Hall, the screenwriter of “American Sniper,” directed. BAD BLOOD THE MOVIE  Here’s a problem that Taylor Swift wouldn’t even try to solve: After an attack on a full-moon night, a college-age woman (Mary Malloy) turns into a vicious monster. The twist? She’s not a werewolf, but a were-frog. Ribbit. 11/8/16  Eighteen filmmakers followed voters in 25 states on Election Day 2016. This documentary is the result. FRANK SERPICO  The New York Police Department whistle-blower immortalized by Al Pacino in Sidney Lumet’s 1973 film speaks for himself in a documentary directed by Antonino D’Ambrosio. THE LIGHT OF THE MOON  After a sexual assault, an architect (Stephanie Beatriz) struggles to resume her life just as it was before. Jessica M. Thompson wrote and directed. 1945  To pay tribute to the dead after the Holocaust, an Orthodox Jewish man and his son travel back to a Hungarian village, where many of the residents were collaborators. Ferenc Torok directed. ALONG FOR THE RIDE  When “Easy Rider” (1969) was a runaway success, Hollywood briefly believed that Dennis Hopper was a bankable director. Universal Pictures gave him a budget and the chance to make “The Last Movie” (1971), a fiasco by reputation that time has treated kindly. There has already been one documentary about its legendarily chaotic making, “The American Dreamer.” This one is based on anecdotes told to the director Nick Ebeling and covers some of Hopper’s later career as well. A BAD MOMS CHRISTMAS  It seems like only  yesterday  that Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn were laying waste to good-mom stereotypes. They’re at it again, only this time it’s the holidays. The original writer-director team, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, returns. BLADE OF THE IMMORTAL  The immortal is probably the director, Japan’s Takashi Miike; this is said to be his 100th film. Like his “13 Assassins,” this outing is a samurai tale, albeit one based on a manga. DREAM BOAT  A German documentary follows five subjects on a cruise exclusively for gay men. GILBERT  If you think the comedian Gilbert Gottfried’s voice could peel paint, you’re out of luck, because this is a documentary about him. Neil Berkeley directs this portrait of his life offstage. LAST FLAG FLYING  Set in 2003, the opening-night feature at this year’s New York Film Festival is said to be a riff on Hal Ashby’s “The Last Detail.” Richard Linklater directs Steve Carell, Laurence Fishburne and Bryan Cranston as old Vietnam War pals who travel together to bury Mr. Carell’s character’s son, killed in Iraq. LBJ  Woody Harrelson plays Lyndon B. Johnson from roughly the time of his loss at the 1960 Democratic National Convention through the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 during his unexpected presidency. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Lady Bird Johnson. Rob Reiner directed. MOST BEAUTIFUL ISLAND  The Spanish actress Ana Asensio writes, directs and stars in this thriller about an undocumented immigrant who, looking for a bit of work, becomes a pawn in a game. MY FRIEND DAHMER  If you’ve ever wondered what kind of mystery meat Jeffrey Dahmer ate in the school cafeteria, here’s a film about his teenage years. It’s based on a graphic novel by Derf Backderf, who went to school with Dahmer. Ross Lynch, a singer who starred in the Disney Channel series “Austin & Ally,” undergoes an alarming image makeover to play the Milwaukee Monster before he earned that nickname. NO DRESS CODE REQUIRED  A couple who run a salon in Baja California, Mexico, both men, stump for their right to marry in a documentary by Cristina Herrera Borquez. ROMAN J. ISRAEL, ESQ.  Denzel Washington is the title character in this legal drama, written and directed by Dan Gilroy (“Nightcrawler”). With Colin Farrell and Carmen Ejogo. THOR: RAGNAROK  Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is slinging his hammer again in theaters — or would be, if he had it in hand. Instead, he’s across the universe fighting in a gladiatorial contest against the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Taika Waititi (“What We Do in the Shadows”) may bring an offbeat sensibility to this Marvel tentpole. BITCH  A housewife who’s been taken for granted (Marianna Palka, the movie’s writer and director) takes up residence in her house’s basement and begins behaving like a most un-housebroken dog. The film is a combination of exploitation-style horror and feminist statement. DADDY’S HOME 2  When we last saw Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell, they had buried the hatchet and found a way to split parenting duties (Mr. Ferrell’s character being married to Linda Cardellini, who plays the mother of Mr. Wahlberg’s children). Now the pals are faced with the prospect of seeing their own dads over the holidays. Mr. Ferrell’s effusive and emotional father is played by John Lithgow, while Mr. Wahlberg’s is played by Mel Gibson. Enough said. DESTINATION UNKNOWN  Twelve Holocaust survivors, including a number who have never shared their experiences before, speak in this documentary. I REMEMBER YOU  A woman’s suicide, her missing son and a haunted house are all somehow connected in this Icelandic thriller directed by Oskar Thor Axelsson. IN BETWEEN  Three Palestinian roommates (Mouna Hawa, Sana Jammelieh and Shaden Kanboura) navigate the contradictions of life in Tel Aviv. INTENT TO DESTROY: DEATH, DENIAL & DEPICTION  The veteran documentarian Joe Berlinger (the “Paradise Lost” trilogy) chronicles the making of Terry George’s film  “The Promise,”  a rare large-scale production about the Armenian genocide. The documentary also explores what it frames as Turkish efforts through the years to prevent that story from being told. LADY BIRD  Greta Gerwig’s first solo feature as a director is a droll comedy that draws on her own upbringing in Sacramento, with Saoirse Ronan as her movie counterpart. With Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts and Lucas Hedges (who gave a standout performance as Casey Affleck’s nephew in “Manchester by the Sea”). MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS  The question hovering over this Kenneth Branagh-directed adaptation of Agatha Christie’s classic murder mystery is whether it will change the ending, which at this point is known to anyone who’s read the book, seen Sidney Lumet’s all-star 1974 movie version or just absorbed it through cultural osmosis. Mr. Branagh plays Hercule Poirot. The other celebrity train passengers include Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer. MAYHEM  A virus that turns infected people into pure ids is unleashed in a law office. Steven Yeun and Samara Weaving star in Joe Lynch’s grindhouse-style feature. THE PRICE  A Nigerian-American (Aml Ameen) striving for success in finance faces challenges personally and ethically. It’s the first feature from the writer-director Anthony Onah. SANTA & ANDRES  It’s 1983 and Santa (Lola Amores) is assigned to supervise Andres (Eduardo Martínez), a gay writer in Cuba regarded as suspicious by the regime. Their chilly relationship soon thaws. THELMA  Perhaps a return to form by the Norwegian director Joachim Trier — his last feature, the English-language  “Louder Than Bombs,”  met with a mixed reception from critics — “Thelma” centers on a repressed young woman (Eili Harboe) who leaves her remote hometown to study in Oslo. She begins to experience seizures and an attraction to a classmate (Kaya Wilkins). THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI  When she suspects that a police chief (Woody Harrelson) hasn’t done enough to solve her daughter’s murder, a mother (Frances McDormand) puts that message on three billboards — ticking off a sizable portion of the town. It’s a comedy, of the bleak variety that Martin McDonagh (“In Bruges”) usually makes. With Sam Rockwell and Abbie Cornish. REBELS ON POINTE  A documentarian, Bobbi Jo Hart, goes backstage with the male dance troupe Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo. SONG OF GRANITE  With re-enactments, black-and-white cinematography and ample music, the filmmaker Pat Collins captures the life of the Irish folk singer Joe Heaney. BIG SONIA  The filmmakers follow Sonia, a Holocaust survivor, as she gives speeches and goes about her daily life, which includes receiving an eviction notice at her store. THE BREADWINNER  This feature from the Irish animation studio that made the Oscar-nominated  “The Secret of Kells”  is set in 2001 in Afghanistan, where a 12-year-old disguises herself as a boy to assume her father’s role as the earner for the family. HOLY AIR  Remember the canned air in “Spaceballs”? This comedy concerns a Christian Arab in the Israeli city of Nazareth who tries to sell air from the spot where the Virgin Mary learned she would conceive. JUSTICE LEAGUE  The conventional wisdom on  “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”  is that the director Zack Snyder probably pushed thebrooding-superhero template a bit too far. On the evidence of the first trailer, “Justice League” takes a more tongue-in-cheek tone. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Batman (Ben Affleck) assemble a team that includes Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and the Flash (Ezra Miller). THE LONG NIGHT OF FRANCISCO SANCTIS  An Everyman (Diego Velázquez) in Argentina in 1977, when the country was ruled by a military junta, must choose to prevent a government-sanctioned kidnapping (or not). MUDBOUND  Widely acclaimed at Sundance, the new film from Dee Rees (“Pariah”) is a “they don’t make ’em like they used to” Hollywood-style epic that also tells its story in a way Hollywood never did: Set in the Mississippi Delta around World War II, the movie accords equal weight to the lives of a black sharecropping family (Mary J. Blige, Rob Morgan and Jason Mitchell) and white landowners (Carey Mulligan, Jason Clarke and Garrett Hedlund). ON THE BEACH AT NIGHT ALONE  To his detractors, the droll, prolific South Korean director Hong Sang-soo keeps repeating himself. (At least twice a year, it’s fair to expect a new movie about a filmmaker and his fumbling, soju-addled interactions with women.) “On the Beach at Night Alone,” one of three Hong features to have its premiere in 2017, is said to be even more private, a reflection on how the South Korean news media reacted to word of Mr. Hong’s relationship with his latest muse, Kim Min-hee, who plays an actress (of course), and who won a prize at the Berlin Film Festival for her performance in it. REVOLT  Lee Pace and Berenice Marlohe play a soldier and an aid worker in Africa during an extraterrestrial invasion. This science-fiction movie looks like it’s geared for fans of “District 9.” THE STAR  In this animated feature, the first Christmas is seen from the vantage points of a donkey (voiced by Steven Yeun) and other animals, who sound a lot like Keegan-Michael Key, Kelly Clarkson, Ving Rhames and Gabriel Iglesias. SWEET VIRGINIA  A hit man (Christopher Abbott) and a rodeo champion (Jon Bernthal) cross paths in Alaska. It’s a noir, of course. With Imogen Poots and Rosemarie DeWitt. WONDER  A boy with a facial deformity (Jacob Tremblay) must deal with the difficulty of being the new kid in school. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson play his parents. Stephen Chbosky, the author and filmmaker of “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” directed. COCO  Pixar takes inspiration from the Mexican holiday Día de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead) — a name Disney  tried to trademark  — for an animated outing in which a boy (Anthony Gonzalez) who aspires to be a musician discovers a world filled with skeletons and hidden secrets. Gael García Bernal and Benjamin Bratt are among the voices. DEATH WISH  Credit for the crude fascination of the 1974 “Death Wish” belongs to its oddball star, Charles Bronson, who, with his mustache and sly half-smiles, never really looked like a guy prepared to turn on a dime into a violent vigilante. Bruce Willis, on the other hand, can do ice-cold. For this “reimagining,” Eli Roth (“Hostel”) directed and Joe Carnahan (“The Grey”) wrote the script, so expect an uptick in gore. DARKEST HOUR  Wearing what looks like several pounds of makeup, Gary Oldman plays Winston Churchill in the immediate days following his ascension to prime minister as he faces the history-altering decision to negotiate with Nazi Germany or continue leading Britain into war. Joe Wright directed; Kristin Scott Thomas and Lily James also star. THE MAN WHO INVENTED CHRISTMAS  Like “Finding Neverland” and “Goodbye Christopher Robin” (see above), “The Man Who Invented Christmas” seems predicated on the notion that most interesting underpinnings of any work of fiction are the autobiographical elements that inspired it. Did Charles Dickens (Dan Stevens) ever meet a Ghost of Christmas Past? MOLLY’S GAME  Can Aaron Sorkin pace his own dialogue? We’ll find out in his directorial debut, based on the true story of Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain), who was known for arranging secret poker games for well-heeled, sometimes famous players and was  named in an indictment  in 2013 for her role in a gambling ring. (She  was sentenced to a year’s probation .) Idris Elba, Kevin Costner and Michael Cera also star. BOMBSHELL: THE HEDY LAMARR STORY  Ms. Lamarr scandalized filmgoers when she skinny-dipped in Gustav Machaty’s “Ecstasy” (1933), but this documentary argues that there was a much more consequential surprise in her career: She was an unheralded inventor. As part of the fight against the Nazis, she helped devise a technological system that provided the underpinnings of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. CALL ME BY YOUR NAME  A teenager (Timothée Chalamet) in northern Italy for the summer is drawn to an American doctoral student (Armie Hammer) who arrives at the villa. Luca Guadagnino directed this adaptation of André Aciman’s novel, and the reaction at film festivals has been nothing short of rapturous. With Michael Stuhlbarg. THE CURRENT WAR  Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl”) directed this story of the rivalry between Thomas Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George Westinghouse (Michael Shannon) to set the standard for electrical power. With Katherine Waterston, Nicholas Hoult and Tom Holland. NAPLES ’44  In this ode to Naples, Norman Lewis, a British soldier who arrived in the Italian city during the Allied forces’ liberation of Italy, has his memories read by Benedict Cumberbatch. THE DISASTER ARTIST  In the history of the medium, only a handful of movies are so incompetent that they defy all explanation. The midnight movie “The Room” certainly qualifies. One of its actors, Greg Sestero, along with Tom Bissell, wrote an account of that film’s making, and now James Franco has turn that account into a movie, casting himself as Tommy Wiseau, the fiercely independent personality who willed “The Room” into being. With Dave Franco, Seth Rogen and Ari Graynor. THE NEW RADICAL  Adam Bhala Lough’s documentary focuses on two men with extreme views on the flow of information in the digital world: Cody Wilson, who  invented  a gun made with pieces generated from a 3-D printer and uploaded the blueprint, and Amir Taaki, Mr. Wilson’s collaborator on a project to broaden the use of Bitcoin. THE OTHER SIDE OF HOPE  That’s the perfect title for a film by Aki Kaurismaki, the bleakly comic Finnish filmmaker of “Le Havre” and “The Man Without a Past.” He won best director at the Berlin Film Festival for this tale of a restaurant owner (Sakari Kuosmanen) who befriends a Syrian (Sherwan Haji) seeking asylum in Helsinki. POLAROID  What “The Ring” was to VHS tapes, this movie is to Polaroid photographs. Must horror movies ruin all of our favorite obsolete technologies? TRIBES OF PALOS VERDES  A young woman (Maika Monroe) new to a beach community in Southern California looks to surfing as an escape from her fractured family life. Based on the novel by Joy Nicholson, the movie also stars Jennifer Garner and Alicia Silverstone. WONDER WHEEL  If it’s a year that ends in a number, there must be a new Woody Allen movie. His latest, which closes the New York Film Festival on Oct. 15, revolves around a family living in Coney Island in the 1950s. With Kate Winslet, Jim Belushi, Juno Temple and Justin Timberlake. BILL FRISELL: A PORTRAIT  Emma Franz’s documentary delves into the guitarist’s career and process. Bonnie Raitt and Paul Simon are among the other musicians who appear. ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD  Ridley Scott directs a thriller inspired by the real-life abduction of 16-year-old  J. Paul Getty III , whose wealthy but stingy grandfather dragged his feet on paying the ransom, not wanting to create an incentive for the kidnapping of his other grandchildren. Charlie Plummer plays the teenager, Kevin Spacey his grandfather and Michelle Williams his mother. HOLLOW IN THE LAND  Dianna Agron plays a woman who believes her brother, who has vanished, is innocent of murder, despite clues pointing to his guilt. FILM STARS DON’T DIE IN LIVERPOOL  Annette Bening channels Gloria Grahame, the glamorous,  scandalous  star of “In a Lonely Place,” in her twilight years in England (after the collapse of her marriage to her former stepson, Tony Ray). It’s based on a memoir by Peter Turner, who is played by Jamie Bell. Paul McGuigan directed. THE SHAPE OF WATER  Guillermo del Toro specializes in creepy-crawlies, and this tale of a mute lab worker (Sally Hawkins) who befriends an aquatic creature looks to have fabulous production values. Octavia Spencer, Michael Shannon and Richard Jenkins also star. VILLA CAPRI  Whatever happened to Ron Shelton, the longtime maker of hit sports comedies (“Bull Durham,” “White Men Can’t Jump”)? In his first theatrical feature since 2003, he directs Morgan Freeman as a Palm Springs resort manager who joins forces with a tenant (Tommy Lee Jones). With Rene Russo and Glenne Headly, who died in June. MISS KIET’S CHILDREN  Petra Lataster-Czisch and Peter Lataster take their cameras into the classroom of a Dutch teacher who educates refugees. THE BALLAD OF LEFTY BROWN  Jared Moshé directs this old-school western, about a sidekick (Bill Pullman) on the trail of the men who killed his partner (Peter Fonda). FERDINAND  “The Story of Ferdinand,” the 1936  children’s book  by Munro Leaf about a gentle bull who “liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers,” charges onto the screen in an animated feature from Carlos Saldanha (the “Ice Age” movies). John Cena lends his voice to Ferdinand; the other vocal talent includes Kate McKinnon, Gina Rodriguez and Daveed Diggs. GOTTI  John Gotti, the crime boss and  “first media don,”  was already the focus of a 1996 TV movie, in which he was played by Armand Assante. In this theatrical film, which covers 30 years, John Travolta assumes impersonation duties, as he did for Robert Shapiro. Mr. Travolta’s wife, Kelly Preston, plays Gotti’s. The screenwriters are Lem Dobbs (“The Limey”) and the character actor Leo Rossi; directed by Kevin Connolly of “Entourage” fame. PERMANENT  That’s “permanent” as in the hair style, which apparently goes awry in this coming-of-age comedy. It stars Kira McLean, Patricia Arquette and Rainn Wilson. STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI  “Last” is not a word in the “Star Wars” vocabulary, especially in an age when — as with Peter Cushing in 2016’s stand-alone episode, “Rogue One” — the actors no longer need to be alive to perform in the movie. When we left Rey (Daisy Ridley) in “The Force Awakens,” she was dangling a light saber at Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Rian Johnson (“Looper”) directed this installment, employing a  record-low  number of wipe transitions. JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE  “Jumanji” is rebooted in an unusually literal sense: Four teenagers cleaning out their school’s basement discover not a board game but a video game that sucks them in to a jungle adventure. And in that world, they aren’t teenagers but avatars, played by Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black. Jake Kasdan directed. BRIGHT  The “Suicide Squad” director David Ayer’s movie is set in a fantastical mishmash of Los Angeles. Will Smith and Joel Edgerton play buddy cops — one human (Mr. Smith) and one orc (Mr. Edgerton). Their discovery of a magic wand leads them into an adventure. With Noomi Rapace, Lucy Fry and Edgar Ramírez. DOWNSIZING  Alexander Payne (working with his frequent screenwriting partner Jim Taylor) directs a parable for cash-strapped times. A couple (Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig) learn that they can live large on the money they have — if they have themselves miniaturized. With Christoph Waltz, Jason Sudeikis, Neil Patrick Harris and Hong Chau. HAPPY END  Michael Haneke returns to several of his favorite themes — voyeurism, hypocrisy, the moral emptiness of the bourgeoisie and the loneliness of death — in a movie that, understandably, struck many critics at Cannes as a retread. Jean-Louis Trintignant (from Mr. Haneke’s “Amour”) is the head of a rich, venal family; Isabelle Huppert, a Haneke regular, is in the cast as well. PITCH PERFECT 3  Now out of college, the Bellas reunite to perform their exuberant brand of a cappella at a U.S.O. show. Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow and Hailee Steinfeld all return. Trish Sie (the not-bad  “Step Up All In” ) directed. THE POST  The Washington Post already had its  Watergate movie ; must it hog the Pentagon Papers as well? Steven Spielberg pops into The Post’s newsroom to watch the paper’s publisher Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) and executive editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) as they decide whether to report on classified documents that revealed a secret history of the Vietnam War. The Times  broke the story ; The Post joined in  five days following  the initial publication after a federal judge  ordered The Times to halt . In New York Times Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court concluded that both papers had a right to publish. With Alison Brie, Carrie Coon and many others. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN  Well, this is a novelty act — or at least might have been before the success of “La La Land”: a modern, straight-to-screen musical, based on the rise of P. T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman). Let’s hope it wasn’t guided by the principle that “there’s a sucker born every minute” (a quote often attributed to Barnum). Michelle Williams, Zac Efron and Zendaya also star. Michael Gracey, who has worked in visual effects and commercials, directed this debut feature. The songs are by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who collaborated on “La La Land.” UNTITLED PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON FILM  Relatively little is known about Paul Thomas Anderson’s first feature since “Inherent Vice” (2014), except that it reunites him with Daniel Day-Lewis — unforgettable in “There Will Be Blood” — and that it centers on a dressmaker who tailors for the crème de la crème of London in the 1950s. More listings for the new season:  Art  |  Classical  |  Dance  |  Pop  |  Television  |  Theater Compiled with the assistance of Suzanne O’Connor.',\n",
       " 'This episode, which lacks any Versace (Gianni or Donatella), felt to me like the freshest so far in “The Assassination of Gianni Versace,” the second season of “American Crime Story.” We are introduced to several new characters, chiefly Lee Miglin (Mike Farrell) and his wife, Marilyn Miglin (Judith Light). Their portrayal of a Chicago couple who have made the best of a 38-year marriage despite the lie at its center is both plausible and moving. Marilyn, a feisty former dancer, has become an entrepreneur who sells her fragrances and cosmetics on the Home Shopping Network. “Perfume is about our bodies talking to each other without words,” she tells viewers. Lee is a commercial real estate developer, a Catholic who keeps a religious altar in his home where he prays for God’s forgiveness for his sexual attraction to men, and says he has done his best to resist temptation. It’s all slightly campy, but these two, whose relationship could easily have been portrayed in a mawkish or ridiculous way, came across to me as deeply sympathetic. God only knows how many marriages between ambitious women and closeted gay men were created (and endured, even now) during the decades-long rights revolution in the United States that culminated with the full striking down of sodomy laws, in 2003, and the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage, in 2015. How did these couples manage these lies, while striving to lead lives of decency and integrity? Like the series over all, this week’s episode is not told in chronological order. It is 1997. We follow Marilyn from a work trip in Toronto back to her home on Chicago’s Gold Coast, where she quickly notices that things are not as they should be. Two passing friends dial the police. Marilyn sits in the kitchen, her polished nails dancing on the granite countertop, as a bloodcurdling scream is heard from the garage: Lee’s mutilated body has been found. “I knew it,” Marilyn says under her breath. Flash backward, a week earlier: Marilyn and Lee are at a fund-raising luncheon for Gov. Jim Edgar, Republican of Illinois. She introduces her husband in terms so admiring as to be gushing: “So often we are told the American dream is dead. Except I say: Look at my husband, Lee. One of seven children. The son of an Illinois coal miner. He began his career selling premixed pancake batter out of the trunk of a beat-up old car. And today Lee manages 32 million square feet of commercial property across the Midwest.” Later, at home, Marilyn moisturizes her face and removes her cosmetic eyelashes. It would have been easy for the episode’s writer (Tom Rob Smith) and director (Gwyneth Horder-Payton) to have this moment be the one when the mask of a happy marriage is removed, its ugly face revealed. In some ways that happens: In a quiet moment before the mirror, Marilyn applies a drop of perfume down the front of her silk robe, her eyes hollowed out with longing. In another room, Lee takes a call from Andrew Cunanan, dialing from a pay phone, and when Marilyn asks who is calling, he lies and says it’s a business call. But the marriage is not merely a sham. When Marilyn asks Lee what he plans to do while she is away on business, he sounds down. She asks him to accompany her. “I like it when you’re there,” she says, and she means it. It is their last meaningful encounter. With Marilyn away, Lee opens his door to the serial killer, who happens to be in town. Lee shows him his plans to build a 125-story, 1,952-foot  Sky Needle , which would have been the world’s tallest building. The conversation does not go well. Andrew thinks the main point of having a building taller than the Sears Tower (now  Willis Tower ) is to surpass the latter structure’s observation deck. Andrew also urges Lee to name the tower for himself, something the self-effacing developer has no intention of doing. They kiss — “It feels like I’m alive,” Lee says — and Andrew boasts: “Escorts don’t normally kiss, do they? I am not like most escorts. I am not like most anybody. I could almost be a husband, a partner.” I found this reference to marriage anachronistic, and puzzling, and not for the first time in this series. In earlier episodes, Gianni Versace’s partner, Antonio D’Amico, tired of their hedonistic lifestyle, proposes, and Cunanan tells a friend — falsely, we believe — that Versace once proposed to him. I’m certainly not making light of commitment or the desire for it. But I’m puzzled by the use of words like “husband” and “proposed.” They don’t seem true to my own memories of the late 1990s, when gay men were more likely to speak of boyfriends, partners and companions, and they seem strangely ahistoric. My next quibble with this episode is more prosaic: the killing of Lee Miglin, in his garage, by Cunanan is so grisly and sadistic as to be difficult to watch. I’ll spare the details, but the monologue Cunanan delivers before delivering the coup de grâce bears note: The monologue raises the question: Is Cunanan motivated by self-hatred, a desire to expose hypocrisy, or both? His use of homophobic language suggests self-hatred, but his focus on disgrace suggests some kind of crusade. It is not, of course, a crime to cross-dress, or to look at porn. This mutual failure of recognition — murderer and victim seem to agree on one thing, that to be gay is a disgrace — is perhaps the saddest moment in this series so far. The rest of the episode is a tour de force by Judith Light, whose portrayal of a wife in denial is simply magnificent. She offers a brisk inventory of what’s missing from the house — a Lexus, $2,000 in cash, two leather coats, two suits, “some inconsequential pieces of jewelry,” rare gold coins and a dozen pairs of socks — as she reaches the conclusion that the killing must have been a random and opportunistic robbery. Told by the Chicago police superintendent about the gay porn found next to the body, Marilyn surmises that “they must have belonged to the killer,” but goes on to say: “I’m not interested in his intentions. Find him, catch him, but don’t talk to me about what or might not be going through his mind.” She adds: “Dollars, jewelry, socks, suits — that’s all I’ll allow that man to steal from me. He won’t steal my good name. Our good name. We worked too hard making that name, and we made it together.” For an ambitious woman born in the 1930s to have a husband who is fully supportive of her professional aspirations might indeed, as she suggests, have been “a fairy tale life.” “How many husbands believe in their wives’ dreams?” she asks her Home Shopping Network viewers — and us — later in the episode. “How many treat us as partners, as equals?” Left unsaid: Perhaps his being gay allowed him to be such a supportive partner. Compared with all this, Cunanan’s murderous escapades seem mundane. He flees to New Jersey, and the police failure to capture him after a radio station reveals that investigators have been tracking his movements by car phone. In search of a new car to steal, he stops at a cemetery, where he marches one of the groundskeepers into a basement and makes him get down on his knees. The man begs for mercy, but his plea is cut short. And for the first time in this series I was so disgusted by this killer’s lack of remorse that — for a moment at least — I didn’t want to keep watching. At least most of carnage is out of the way. Six more episodes, two more bodies to go.',\n",
       " 'When a gunman opened fire with an AR-15 at a large high school in south Florida, the 17 dead included students and school workers, young and old. Here is a look at the 17 confirmed dead by authorities in the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School: COACH AND SECURITY MONITOR Assistant football coach Aaron Feis was shot to death while selflessly shielding students from bullets. A tweet from the school football program ended: \"He died a hero and he will forever be in our hearts and memories.\" Feis, 37, graduated from the school in 1999 and worked mainly with the junior varsity, the team website said. It said he lived in nearby Coral Springs with his wife and daughter. The team website said Feis spent his entire coaching career at Marjory Stoneman after playing there as a student. The Sun Sentinel reported that Feis, acting as a school security guard, responded to the original call on a school walkie-talkie. Someone on the radio asked if loud sounds they heard were firecrackers, said football coach Willis May, who also carries a radio. \"I heard Aaron say, \\'No, that is not firecrackers.\\' That\\'s the last I heard of him,\" May said. ___ FRIEND WON\\'T GET TO SAY \\'I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL\\' Joaquin Oliver, 17, was known by his nickname \"Guac,\" short for \"guacamole,\" because many couldn\\'t pronounce his first name. \"My friend will literally never get to say, \\'I graduated high school,\\'\" said Tyra Hemans, a 19-year-old who said she had been friends with Oliver since they were freshmen. Hemans said she last saw her friend at school the day of the shooting. \"It was just a brief \\'Happy Valentine\\'s,\\'\" she said. \"He was with his girlfriend and I was just like, \\'Oh my God, you guys are so cute.\\'\" She added, \"He\\'s just a goofball. He\\'s the only kid you\\'d know that would dye his hair bleach-blond, walk around school, put some tiger stripes in and just be unique. He was a unique soul.\" ___ ATHLETIC DIRECTOR \\'WAS JUST AMAZING\\' A married father of two and the athletic director at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Chris Hixon wasn\\'t shy about jumping in wherever he was needed, said friend and one-time colleague Dianne Sanzari. Hixon, 49, belonged to a Roman Catholic church in Hollywood. The Archdiocese of Miami confirmed his death Thursday. When a volleyball team needed a fill-in coach, Hixon took over; the same thing happened with the wrestling team, Sanzari said. And when the school needed someone to patrol the campus and monitor threats as a security specialist, Hixon did that, too. It was in that security role that Hixon apparently came within range of the shooter. ___ \\'AN ANGEL TAKEN AWAY FROM US\\' Meadow Pollack\\'s parents called her phone repeatedly only to hear it ring, as they kept an anxious vigil outside the hospital. But on Thursday, her father, Andrew Pollack, confirmed that his daughter was among the dead, the Palm Beach Post reported. Eighteen-year-old Pollack, a senior, had planned to attend Lynn University, her father said. \"Her life was taken way too soon and I have no words to describe how this feels,\" friend Gii Lovito posted on Facebook. Family friend Adam Schachtel said in a Facebook post that \"an angel was taken away from us in that horrific tragedy ... no words can be said so just prayers and sadness.\" ___ VICTIM\\'S FAMILY: \"LIVE FOR ALYSSA!\" An amateur soccer club said one of its players, Alyssa Alhadeff, was among the students killed in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Parkland Soccer Club posted on its Facebook page that Alhadeff, 14, was a \"loved and well respected member of our club and community.\" The club posted a note it said was from her family which read: \"To Alyssa\\'s Friends honor Alyssa by doing something fabulous in your life. Don\\'t ever give up and inspire for greatness. Live for Alyssa! Be her voice and breathe for her. Alyssa loved you all forever!\" ___ \"ONLY SADNESS\" Fourteen-year-old Alaina Petty was among those who died in the shooting, great-aunt Claudette McMahon Joshi confirmed in a Facebook post. \"There are no hashtags for moments like this, only sadness,\" she wrote, asking people to lift up Petty\\'s family in prayer. Petty attended a local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Petty was a \"valiant young member of the Coral Springs Ward,\" Church leader Stephen E. Thompson wrote in an update. ___ GEOGRAPHY TEACHER HELPED STUDENTS Students said geography teacher Scott Beigel, 35, helped them enter a locked classroom to avoid the gunman and paid for the brave act with his life. \"If the shooter would have come into the room, I probably wouldn\\'t be speaking to you now,\" student Kelsey Friend told Good Morning America. Friend said when she heard gunshots and realized it wasn\\'t a drill she followed other students toward the classroom. Beigel \"unlocked the door and let us in,\" she said. \"I thought he was behind me, but he wasn\\'t. When he opened the door he had to relock it so we could stay safe, but he didn\\'t get a chance to.\" Student Bruna Oliveda said she saw Beigel blocking the door. \"I don\\'t know how we\\'re alive,\" she said. ___ 14-YEAR-OLD LOOKED OUT FOR UNDERDOGS Ninth grader Jaime Guttenberg, 14, loved to dance and hoped to become an occupational therapist and mother, aunt Abbie Youkilis said. \"She always looked out for the underdog and the bullied and she probably had been kind to the (former) student who shot her,\" Youkilis said in a written statement sent to The Associated Press. Guttenberg leaves her parents, Fred and Jennifer Guttenberg, and brother Jesse. Her father said in a Facebook post that he is \"trying to figure out how my family gets through this.\" Youkilis called for gun-control legislation, saying Jaime\\'s parents were \"the world\\'s most loving and over-protective parents but they could not protect Jaime from the sickness that has gripped our country.\" ___ BALLOONS FOR THE VICTIMS Shooting victim Martin Duque, 14, was one of Isaac Briones\\' best friends. \"He was like, one of the nicest people I knew,\" said Briones, 15. \"He was so caring.\" Briones said he last saw Martin the day of the shooting during first period. \"We were just playing around, talking about jokes and stuff,\" said Isaac, who was outside the school Thursday with others holding a group of white balloons for the victims. On Instagram, Miguel Duque wrote that words can\\'t describe the pain of losing his brother. He added: \"I love brother Martin you\\'ll be missed buddy. I know you\\'re in a better place. Duques forever man I love you junior!!! R.I.P Martin Duque!\" ___ FRESHMAN COLOR GUARD MEMBER Shooting victim Gina Montalto was a 14-year-old freshman who participated on the winter color guard squad at the school. Friends and relatives posted tributes on Facebook, including mother Jennifer Montalto. \"She was a smart, loving, caring, and strong girl who brightened any room she entered. She will be missed by our family for all eternity,\" said the post. One of Montalto\\'s color guard instructors from middle school, Manuel Miranda, told the Miami Herald that Montalto was \"the sweetest soul ever.\" \"She was kind, caring always smiling and wanting to help,\" Miranda said. ___ SWIMMING SCHOLARSHIP WINNER Nicholas Dworet, 17, had committed to swim for the University of Indianapolis. The college announced Thursday that the senior was among those killed in the mass shooting at his high school. In a statement, UIndy swimming coach Jason Hite called Dworet an \"energetic and very vibrant kind\" who cheered for his soon-to-be university during a swimming meet last month. \"I spoke with his mom this morning, and she reiterated the fact that he was really looking forward to this next step in his life and becoming a Hound,\" said Hite. \"He really felt like he had a family in the team, and was really excited about what we\\'re doing up here.\" ___ ROTC STUDENT Peter Wang, a 15-year-old ROTC student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, wasn\\'t interested in status but wanted to help others, relatives said. A cousin, Aaron Chen, told the Miami Herald that Wang was last seen holding a door open so others could get away from the gunman. Friends and relatives first thought Wang was just missing and checked with area hospitals. They later found out he had been killed. \"He wasn\\'t supposed to die,\" Chen told First Coast News. ___ FAMILY SEARCHED HOSPITALS, AND THEN ... Fifteen-year-old Luke Hoyer was a loving, sweet person who loved basketball and \"smiled all the time,\" his aunt Joan Cox said. \"He was just a good kid ... very loving and just enjoyed life,\" said Cox, of Greenville, South Carolina. She said Luke\\'s parents, Gena and Tom Hoyer, searched for their son at hospitals before finally going to the law enforcement command center, where they eventually learned he had died. \"It\\'s just a terrible thing,\" said Cox, who said the family — including Luke\\'s older sister Abby and brother Jake — spent Christmas with her and other family in South Carolina. \"We just all pretty much can\\'t get over it.\" ___ NATIONAL MERIT SEMIFINALIST AMONG VICTIMS Carmen Schentrup was a smart girl with a sweet smile. In September, she was named one of 53 National Merit Scholarship Program semifinalists in the county and a classmate tweeted \"we all praised for her intelligence.\" Cousin Matt Brandow posted on Facebook that the 16-year-old visited Washington State recently and said she wanted to go to the University of Washington. He asked: you like the rain? \"She answers, I hate sweating in the humid Florida weather,\" Brandow wrote. \"That\\'s when I knew you were perfect for Washington.\" ___ RESERVED AND ACADEMICALLY RELENTLESS Helena Ramsay was soft-spoken, but also smart and a go-getter, her cousin Sefena Cooper said Thursday. The 17-year-old junior especially loved hanging out with friends and family, \"and for this to happen is heartbreaking,\" Cooper said. \"Although somewhat reserved, she had a relentless motivation towards her academic studies and her soft warm demeanor brought the best out in all who knew her,\" another relative, Curtis Page Jr., wrote on Facebook. \"She was so brilliant and witty, and I\\'m still wrestling with the idea that she is actually gone,\" he wrote. \"She would have started college next year.\" ___ MEMORIAL FOR BAND MEMBER Trombone and baritone player Alex Schachter was a \"sweetheart of a kid,\" according to a social media post by father Max Schachter. In honor of his 14-year-old freshman son, Schachter wrote on a gofundme page that he was starting a scholarship fund \"to help other students experience the joys of music as well as fund increased security at schools.\" The message said: \"Please help keep Alex\\'s spirit alive.\" ___ RELATIVES OF VICTIM \"ABSOLUTELY GUTTED\" Cara Loughran, 14, was an excellent student who loved the beach and her cousins, according to her family. An aunt, Lindsay Fontana, wrote on Facebook: \"I had to tell my 8-year-old daughters that their sweet cousin Cara was killed in the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School yesterday. We are absolutely gutted.\" \"While your thoughts are appreciated, I beg you to DO SOMETHING,\" she wrote. \"This should not have happened to our niece Cara and it cannot happen to other people\\'s families.\" Loughran\\'s neighbor posted a picture of her cheering on a young boy riding a bike with training wheels. \"RIP Cara,\" Danny Vogel wrote, \"and fly with the angels. You will be greatly missed, and we will always love you and celebrate your beautiful life.\" ___ This story has been corrected to spell victim Helena Ramsay\\'s last name. ___ Reeves reported from Birmingham, Alabama. Contributing to this report were Tammy Webber in Chicago; Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho; and David Porter in New York; Kelli Kennedy in Parkland, Florida; Michael Hill in Albany, New York; and Amanda Lee Myers in Los Angeles. ___ This story has been corrected with the right spelling of Helena Ramsay\\'s last name. Authorities previously gave a different spelling of the name.',\n",
       " '“I am a garbage pail,” the gossip columnist Liz Smith once said. “My best stories come from other newspaper people and media people. My best stories come from people at The New York Times and CBS and NBC and ABC and Time and Newsweek. People who are frustrated by what they know and don’t have a place to print.” Her favorite foods were fried, her favorite exercise was none, and when she dined at restaurants — which was pretty much all the time — she left inordinately large tips, saying, “no one ever got rich stiffing a waiter.” Although she never won a Pulitzer Prize, Mike Wallace once said she was more widely read (and better paid) than almost anyone who did. She trafficked in gossip, but knew “The Odyssey” backward and forward. And, somewhat counterintuitively, she regarded benevolence as an essential requirement of her job. So when Ms. Smith was celebrated Friday afternoon at a memorial at the Majestic Theater in Midtown Manhattan on what would have been her 95th birthday, it made some sense that people who appeared regularly in her columns were not cheering her death  the way others had cheered Walter Winchell’s , but were instead tearing up on stage, talking about her as a friend, confidante and mentor. The crowd included people from virtually every sector of media and entertainment. Toward the front on the left was Gay Talese. Just behind was the film producer Jean Doumanian. A ways over was Tom Wolfe. Cynthia McFadden, a correspondent at NBC, was the first speaker and said that Ms. Smith had at first been against having a memorial. “But with a little loving encouragement, she seemed to soften,” Ms. McFadden said. So much so, in fact, that by the time she died, there was an exit note left in her sofa with detailed instructions to friends that included the request (“in all caps,” Ms. McFadden noted) that they hold this posthumous event at a Shubert Theater. Ta da! Barry Diller spoke after Ms. McFadden and talked about how he shared a birthday with Ms. Smith and Elaine Stritch. One year, Mr. Diller, Ms. Stritch and Ms. Smith decided to celebrate at the 21 Club. That excursion came to an end after the third oyster, when Ms. Stritch said, “this place is a dump,” grabbed everyone’s coats and took them to  3 Guys . In the late 1980s, Mr. Diller worked as an executive at Fox, where one of his responsibilities was starting what he described as an “‘Entertainment Tonight”-type show. “Liz introduced me to a producer she had known and who I had never met before,” Mr. Diller said. “He’d come from political campaigning, and I thought he’d be great. He was, but not for this show. We became friends, and later I introduced him to Rupert Murdoch. His name was Roger Ailes. So, Liz, it’s all your fault.” Other speakers included the actors Renée Zellweger (who described Ms. Smith traveling to Austin, Tex., in 2011, despite a hip injury, so she could accompany her to a film festival), Bruce Willis (who recalled Ms. Smith’s habit of using her column for charitable causes) and Holland Taylor (who met Ms. Smith back in the mid-’70s and received her last email from Ms. Smith around Nov. 5, a week before  her death ). Had Ms. Taylor and Ms. Smith enjoyed a summer romance back at the beginning of their relationship? Ms. Taylor alluded to that possibility from the stage, but said that what really endured between them was a friendship that “was for me the single safe harbor in what has always seemed a storm-tossed scattered life in, let’s not kid ourselves, the mean old world.” The writer Billy Norwich said he owed his name to Ms. Smith. She had been a mentor to him when he was young, broke and looking to break into the publishing business. “‘Honey,’” he recalled her telling him, “‘the first thing we need to do is get you a better name if you’re going to be a writer.’ I was born Billy Goldberg in Norwich, Conn., and one day over lunch I became Billy Norwich from Goldberg, Conn. Which is very useful because you get the anti-Semitism direct that way.” Over the years, Ms. Smith promoted Mr. Norwich relentlessly to colleagues. She also admonished him for misspelling people’s names in his columns at The New York Observer and The New York Daily News, advised him to always have two drinks before he went reporting at society functions, and stepped in front of Oscar de la Renta the night he was about to knock Mr. Norwich out for something he’d written. “Oscar, honey, you can’t hit him. He’s a Jew wearing eyeglasses!” Ms. Smith was said to have said. Occasionally, said Lesley Stahl, another speaker, Ms. Smith got into feuds of her own. Long before President Trump began calling CNN “fake news,” Ms. Stahl said he vowed to purchase The Daily News merely so he could fire Ms. Smith, who had written disparagingly about him during his divorce from Ivana Trump. And Ms. Smith did have a few shortcomings. For example, Ms. McFadden said, “she was not good at keeping a secret. Professional liability, I guess.” Yet she rarely lost friends. “If she did, she would woo them and get them back,” Ms. Stahl said. I can attest to both of these things being true. For many years, Ms. Smith was a close friend of my mother, Nora Ephron. In 2012, my mother came down with leukemia, and  told almost no one about it . The day my mother went into a coma, about 24 hours before she died, I began calling her extended circle of friends, so that they wouldn’t find out about it when obituaries began appearing. Ms. Smith was among those I called. We had a lovely talk. Having known her for at least 30 years, it never occurred to me she would scoop my mother’s death. But that’s what she did. Hours later, she uploaded a “tribute” to my mother on her website. As someone pointed out on the web, it was about the weirdest obituary that had ever been published given that the subject wasn’t dead yet. I’m sure Ms. Smith was devastated by the loss, but  her claim  that she thought my mother had died when she posted the piece made no sense. In the piece itself, she said my mother hadn’t died. But I couldn’t stay mad at her. She was too kind. She was too smart. She was too much fun. And it was precisely the sort of thing my mother would have found amusing, had it happened to anyone else. (I could almost see my mother saying: “Well, what did you expect?” A scary thing about storytellers is that their central allegiance is to the story.) So seven weeks later, I called Ms. Smith for  help on an article  and  stayed friendly with her  until her death. Bygones. The world was a better place with her in it.',\n",
       " 'The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled this week that anti-gay attacks cannot be prosecuted under the state’s hate crime law, a decision that activists said diverged from recent outcomes in gay and transgender rights cases. The ruling clears the way for a college athlete accused of assaulting two gay men to be tried on lesser charges. The case hinged on whether attacks based on sexual orientation could fall under a hate crime law that does not explicitly mention sexual orientation. Prosecuting lawyers in Cabell County, where the attack took place, argued that “sex,” which the law lists as a protected category, includes crimes committed on the basis of sexual orientation. But the court was not convinced. In a 3-to-2 ruling handed down on Tuesday, it found that “the word ‘sex’ in West Virginia Code § 61-6-21(b) is unambiguous and clearly imparts being male or female, and does not include ‘sexual orientation,’” according to a  majority opinion  written by Chief Justice Allen H. Loughry II. The court’s ruling was celebrated by West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, who did not side with the state, which argued that sexual orientation was a protected category under the hate crime law. In a statement, he called the attack on the two men “deeply disturbing and heinous” but said “such conduct does not give the judicial system a license to rewrite state law.” That consideration appeared to weigh heavily on the court as well. In his opinion, Justice Loughry said the ruling was based in part on the State Legislature’s history of resistance to adding sexual orientation to its hate crime law, a change that has been proposed and rejected 26 times since 1993. West Virginia is one of only six states with a hate crime law that includes sex in its protections but not sexual orientation or gender identity. The attack at the heart of the West Virginia case happened in April 2015, when prosecutors said Steward Butler, then a running back with the Marshall University football team, attacked two men, Casey Williams and Zackary Johnson, after he saw them kissing in public. Prosecutors said Mr. Butler shouted homophobic slurs at them from his car, then got out and punched them in their faces, knocking one of them to the ground. Mr. Butler was  kicked off the football team  and charged with two misdemeanor counts of battery and two felony hate crime counts. The battery charges have not yet gone to trial. Law enforcement officials said the ruling on Tuesday would send his case back to a lower court where he will now face only the misdemeanor charges. Phone calls to the office of Mr. Butler’s lawyer, Raymond Nolan, went unanswered on Thursday. Greg Nevins, a lawyer at the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which filed an amicus brief in the case, said the plaintiffs argued that the men were attacked for violating a gender norm or stereotype. “Put it this way: If you congratulate a man because he marries a woman and then you fire a woman because she marries a woman, that is discrimination on the basis of sex,” Mr. Nevins said. “We have to focus on would this crime have happened if the victims were a different sex.” Mr. Nevins said this was the first time such an argument had been made in a state-level hate crime case. Federal hate crime law explicitly protects against crimes committed on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. In recent years, gay and transgender advocacy groups have won a string of federal anti-discrimination cases in areas like employment, housing and education by arguing that federal laws that forbid sex discrimination, particularly Title VII and Title IX, also cover discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. But that approach has not always been effective. In March, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit  ruled that Jameka Evans , a lesbian, could not sue her employer for anti-gay discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Attacks on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people make up roughly 20 percent of bias attacks and harassment reported to law enforcement agencies, according to  statistics compiled by the F.B.I.  in 2015. Those episodes included assault, intimidation, vandalism, murder and rape. Robin Maril, the associate legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, an L.G.B.T. advocacy group, said the West Virginia ruling was not consistent with “the broad legal trajectory we are seeing in the courts” toward including both sexuality and gender identity under legal protections based on sex, especially in the context of anti-discrimination law. “It’s very, very troubling with the levels of violence against the L.G.B.T. community to see the West Virginia Supreme Court foreclose this option for victims and prosecutors,” she said.',\n",
       " 'Eddie Mounts, the son and grandson of miners, describes the past few years in coal country as a time of economic plague. Businesses closed and people scattered, he said. They went to Tennessee, North Carolina, anywhere work could be found. If they had to learn a new trade, they did that, too. The source of the affliction, he insisted, could be traced to Washington, to the Obama administration and to regulations that Mr. Mounts, 54, said were intentionally designed to shut down the mines: “Shut them down and get them not working.” So he was thrilled with the news on Tuesday that President Trump was signing an  executive order  aiming to roll back some of those regulations. “It may take a couple of years to catch fire again,” Mr. Mounts said. “But I think it will.” It is hard to overstate the antipathy in coal country to the Obama administration’s regulatory approach, beyond even the rules that Mr. Trump has moved to undo. It included the  Clean Power Plan , which would shutter older coal-fired power plants, and which the Trump administration is planning to rewrite, but also the assertiveness of federal health and safety regulation. Some saw these as mere attempts to bully the mines. It came as little surprise that Mr. Trump, who was flanked by coal miners as he signed the executive order in Washington, won Appalachia by huge margins in November. Hope that he can reverse the fortunes of coal country still runs high, as could be seen in the reactions of politicians like West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, a Republican: This is a widespread sentiment — even if there is little solid evidence that Mr. Trump, or any president, can make all that much of a difference. “The market’s going to be what the market is, and that’s what’s going to set the demand,” said Robert Stinson, who operates a small coal mine in the city of War, in southern West Virginia, a few miles from the Virginia state line. Regulations certainly played a part in coal’s downturn, Mr. Stinson said. But only a part. Some of the fiercest coal country critics of the Obama administration have acknowledged as much. Robert E. Murray, an outspoken mining executive,  recently suggested  tempered expectations for a coal rebound. The Senate majority leader,  Mitch McConnell , Republican of Kentucky,  cautioned in November  that the potential impact of a regulatory rollback would be “hard to tell.” There are too many other, more decisive factors behind the decline in central Appalachian coal mining, said Sam Petsonk, a lawyer for Mountain State Justice, a legal aid organization in Charleston, W.Va. “The reserves just aren’t there anymore,” Mr. Petsonk said, explaining that West Virginia reached its coal production peak 20 years ago, and that some of the state’s power plants had even been importing coal from elsewhere. Still, expectations are not so tempered where the downturn is most keenly felt. “We just came into work one day and they said we got a meeting, and they told us,” recalled Mark Gray, 58, of the day he learned that the mine where he worked in Harlan County, Ky., was in trouble. “They said we can’t go on with these regulations, we can’t go on with the way the government’s doing.” A week before Christmas 2013 — five years into the Obama administration, but well before the Clean Power Plan was even announced — the mine shut down for good. Many miners scattered to Virginia or other parts of Kentucky, Mr. Gray said: “They just followed the jobs but the regulations followed them.” Those left behind had little to turn to besides public assistance. Mr. Gray, who has black lung disease, never went back to mining. But he doubts he would have retired so soon if his mine had kept operating. He said Mr. Trump’s moves might help, at least to some degree. “It won’t ever be back the same,” Mr. Gray said. “But I hope some of the jobs come back and fix up little places like Harlan County.” Gary Bentley, who spent a dozen years as a coal miner in eastern Kentucky, is less optimistic. Now working as a mechanic and  writing about his years in the mines , he does not see a big turnaround coming. Blaming environment regulations is an old tradition, he said, one encouraged by the coal industry’s lobbyists. But it ignores too many hard facts, he said, like the increase in mechanization and the abundance of cheap natural gas. “It’s not going to make a comeback,” Mr. Bentley said of coal mining in central Appalachia. “But you get a certain amount of desperation, where you’re willing to believe stuff even though you know in your gut it’s not true.” As much of coal country happily welcomed the news out of Washington, Mr. Bentley pointed to an announcement closer to home: This month  the municipal utility of Owensboro, Ky.,  said its power plant, after 117 years, was going to phase out the burning of coal altogether.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — The campaign ad appeared during the presidential contest of 2008. Rapid-fire images of belching smokestacks and melting ice sheets were followed by a soothing narrator who praised a candidate who had stood up to President George W. Bush and “sounded the alarm on global warming.” It was not made for a Democrat,  but for Senator John McCain , who had just secured the Republican nomination. It is difficult to reconcile the Republican Party of 2008 with the party of 2017, whose leader, President Trump, has called global warming a hoax, reversed environmental policies that Mr. McCain advocated on his run for the White House, and this past week announced that he would  take the nation out of the Paris climate accord , which was to bind the globe in an effort to halt the planet’s warming. The Republican Party’s fast journey from debating how to combat human-caused climate change to arguing that it does not exist is a story of big political money, Democratic hubris in the Obama years and a partisan chasm that grew over nine years like a crack in the Antarctic shelf, favoring extreme positions and uncompromising rhetoric over cooperation and conciliation. “Most Republicans still do not regard climate change as a hoax,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist who worked for Senator Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign. “But the entire climate change debate has now been caught up in the broader polarization of American politics.” “In some ways,” he added, “it’s become yet another of the long list of litmus test issues that determine whether or not you’re a good Republican.” Since Mr. McCain ran for president on climate credentials that were stronger than his opponent Barack Obama’s, the scientific evidence linking greenhouse gases from fossil fuels to the dangerous warming of the planet has grown stronger. Scientists have for the first time drawn concrete links between the planet’s warming atmosphere and changes that affect Americans’ daily lives and pocketbooks, from tidal flooding in Miami to prolonged water shortages in the Southwest to decreasing snow cover at ski resorts. That scientific consensus was enough to pull virtually all of the major nations along. Conservative-leaning governments in Britain, France, Germany and Japan all signed on to successive climate change agreements. Yet when Mr. Trump pulled the United States from the Paris accord, the Senate majority leader, the speaker of the House and every member of the elected Republican leadership were united in their praise. Those divisions did not happen by themselves. Republican lawmakers were moved along by a campaign carefully crafted by fossil fuel industry players, most notably Charles D. and David H. Koch, the Kansas-based billionaires who run a chain of refineries (which can process  600,000 barrels of crude oil per day ) as well as a subsidiary that owns or operates  4,000 miles of pipelines  that move crude oil. Government rules intended to slow climate change are “making people’s lives worse rather than better,” Charles Koch explained in a rare  interview last year  with Fortune, arguing that despite the costs, these efforts would make “very little difference in the future on what the temperature or the weather will be.” Republican leadership has also been dominated by lawmakers whose constituents were genuinely threatened by policies that would raise the cost of burning fossil fuels,  especially coal . Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, always sensitive to the coal fields in his state, rose through the ranks to become majority leader. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming also climbed into leadership, then the chairmanship of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, as a champion of his coal state. Mr. Trump has staffed his White House and cabinet with officials who have  denied, or at least questioned, the existence of global warming . And he has adopted the Koch language, almost to the word. On Thursday, as Mr. Trump announced the United States’ withdrawal,  he at once claimed that the Paris accord would cost the nation millions of jobs and that it would do next to nothing for the climate . Beyond the White House, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Science Committee, held a  hearing this spring  aimed at debunking climate science, calling the global scientific consensus “exaggerations, personal agendas and questionable predictions.” A small core of Republican lawmakers — most of whom are from swing districts and are at risk of losing their seats next year — are taking modest steps like introducing a  nonbinding resolution in the House  in March urging Congress to accept the risks presented by climate change. But in Republican political circles, speaking out on the issue, let alone pushing climate policy, is politically dangerous. So for the most part, these moderate Republicans are biding their time, until it once again becomes safe for Republicans to talk more forcefully about climate change. The question is how long that will take. “With 40 percent of Florida’s population at risk from sea-level rise, my state is on the front lines of climate change,” said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida. “South Florida residents are already beginning to feel the effects of climate change in their daily lives.” It was called the “No Climate Tax” pledge, drafted by a new group called Americans for Prosperity that was funded by the Koch brothers. Its single sentence read: “I will oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue.” Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, was the  first member of Congress to sign it in July 2008 . The effort picked up steam the next year after the House of Representatives passed what is known as cap-and-trade legislation, a concept invented by conservative Reagan-era economists. The idea was to create a statutory limit, or cap, on the overall amount of a certain type of pollution that could be emitted. Businesses could then buy and sell permits to pollute, choosing whether to invest more in pollution permits, or in cleaner technology that would then save them money and allow them to sell their allotted permits. The administration of the first President George Bush successfully deployed the first national cap-and-trade system in 1990 to lower emissions of the pollutants that cause acid rain. Mr. McCain pushed a cap-and-trade proposal to fight climate change. “I thought we could get it done,” recalled Henry A. Waxman, a retired House Democrat who led the cap-and-trade push in 2009. “We just had two candidates from the Republican and Democratic parties who had run for president and agreed that climate change was a real threat.” Conservative activists saw the legislative effort as an opportunity to transform the climate debate. With the help of a small army of oil-industry-funded academics like  Wei-Hock Soon of Harvard Smithsonian  and think tanks like the  Competitive Enterprise Institute , they had been working to discredit academics and government climate change scientists. The lawyer and conservative activist Chris Horner, whose legal clients have included  the coal industry ,  gathered documents  through the Freedom of Information Act to try to embarrass and further undermine the climate change research. Myron Ebell, a senior fellow with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, worked behind the scenes to make sure Republican offices in Congress knew about Mr. Horner’s work — although at the time, many viewed Mr. Ebell skeptically, as an extremist pushing out-of-touch views. In 2009, hackers broke  into a climate research program at the University of East Anglia in England , then released the emails that conservatives said raised doubts about the validity of the research. In one email, a scientist talked of using a statistical “trick” in a chart illustrating a recent sharp warming trend. The research was ultimately validated, but damage was done. As Congress moved toward actually passing climate change legislation, a fringe issue had become a part of the political mainstream. “That was the turning point,” Mr. Horner said. The House  passed the cap-and-trade bill by seven votes , but it went nowhere in the Senate — Mr. Obama’s first major legislative defeat. Unshackled by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision and other related rulings, which ended corporate campaign finance restrictions, Koch Industries and Americans for Prosperity started an all-fronts campaign with television advertising, social media and cross-country events aimed at electing lawmakers who would ensure that the fossil fuel industry would not have to worry about new pollution regulations. Their first target: unseating Democratic lawmakers such as Representatives Rick Boucher and Tom Perriello of Virginia, who had voted for the House cap-and-trade bill, and replacing them with Republicans who were seen as more in step with struggling Appalachia, and who pledged never to push climate change measures. But Americans for Prosperity also wanted to send a message to Republicans. Until 2010, some Republicans ran ads in House and Senate races showing their support for green energy. “After that, it disappeared from Republican ads,” said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. “Part of that was the polling, and part of it was the visceral example of what happened to their colleagues who had done that.” What happened was clear. Republicans who asserted support for climate change legislation or the seriousness of the climate threat saw their money dry up or, worse, a primary challenger arise. “It told Republicans that we were serious,” Mr. Phillips said, “that we would spend some serious money against them.” By the time Election Day 2010 arrived, 165 congressional members and candidates had signed Americans for Prosperity’s “ No Climate Tax” pledge . Most were  victorious . “The midterm election was a clear rejection of policies like the cap-and-trade energy taxes that threaten our still-fragile economy,” said James Valvo, then Americans for Prosperity’s government affairs director, in a statement issued the day after the November 2010 election.  Eighty-three of the 92 new members of Congress  had signed the pledge. Even for congressional veterans, that message was not missed. Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who once called climate change “a serious problem” and co-sponsored a bill to promote energy-efficient light bulbs, tacked right after the 2010 elections as he battled to be chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee against Joe Barton, a Texan who mocked human-caused climate change. Mr. Upton deleted references to climate change from his website. “If you look, the last year was the warmest year on record, the warmest decade on record. I accept that,” he offered that fall. “I do not say that it’s man-made.” Mr. Upton, who has received  more than $2 million  in campaign donations from oil and gas companies and electric utilities over the course of his career, won the chairmanship and has coasted comfortably to re-election since. Two years later, conservative “super PACs” took aim at Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a senior Republican who publicly voiced climate concerns, backed the creation of a Midwestern cap-and-trade program and drove a Prius. After six Senate terms,  Mr. Lugar lost his primary  to a Tea Party challenger, Richard E. Mourdock. Although Mr. Lugar says other reasons contributed, he and his opponents say his public views on climate change played a crucial role. “In my own campaign, there were people who felt strongly enough about my views on climate change to use it to help defeat me, and other Republicans are very sensitive to that possibility,” Mr. Lugar said in an interview. “So even if they privately believe we ought to do something about it, they’re reticent, especially with the Republican president taking the views he is now taking.” After winning re-election in 2012, Mr. Obama understood his second-term agenda would have to rely on executive authority, not legislation that would go nowhere in the Republican-majority Congress. And climate change was the great unfinished business of his first term. To finish it, he would deploy a rarely used provision in the Clean Air Act of 1970, which gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to issue regulations on carbon dioxide. “If Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will,” he declared in his 2013  State of the Union address . The result was the Clean Power Plan, which would significantly cut planet-warming emissions by forcing the closing of hundreds of heavy-polluting coal-fired power plants. The end run around Congress had consequences of its own. To Republican (and some Democratic) critics, the Clean Power Plan exemplified everything they opposed about Mr. Obama: He seemed to them imperious, heavy-handed, pleasing to the elites on the East and West Coasts and in the capitals of Europe, but callous to the blue-collar workers of coal and oil country. “It fed into this notion of executive overreach,” said Heather Zichal, who advised Mr. Obama on climate policy. “I don’t think there was a good enough job on managing the narrative.” Republicans who had supported the climate change agenda began to defect and have since stayed away. “On the issue of climate change, I think it’s happening,” Mr. McCain said in a CNN podcast interview last April. But, he said, “The president decided, at least in the last couple years if not more, to rule by edict.” Mr. Obama’s political opponents saw the climate rules as a ripe opportunity. “When the president went the regulatory route, it gave our side more confidence,” Mr. Phillips said. “It hardened and broadened Republican opposition to this agenda.” Starting in early 2014, the opponents of the rule — including powerful lawyers and lobbyists representing many of America’s largest manufacturing and industrial interests — regularly gathered in a large conference room at the national headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, overlooking the White House. They drafted a long-game legal strategy to undermine Mr. Obama’s climate regulations in a coordinated campaign that brought together 28 state attorneys general and major corporations to form an argument that they expected to eventually take to the Supreme Court. They presented it not as an environmental fight but an economic one, against a government that was trying to vastly and illegally expand its authority. “This is the most significant wholesale regulation of energy that the United States has ever seen, by any agency,” Roger R. Martella Jr., a former E.P.A. lawyer who then represented energy companies, said at  a gathering of industry advocates , making an assertion that has not been tested. Republican attorneys general gathered at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia in August 2015 for their annual summer retreat, with some  special guests : four executives from Murray Energy, one of the nation’s largest coal mining companies. Murray was struggling to avoid bankruptcy — a fate that had befallen  several other  coal mining companies already, given the slump in demand for their product and the rise of natural gas, solar and wind energy. The coal industry  came to discuss  a new part of the campaign to reverse the country’s course on climate change. Litigation was going to be needed, the industry executives and the Republican attorneys general agreed, to block the Obama administration’s climate agenda — at least until a new president could be elected. West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, led the session, “The Dangerous Consequences of the Clean Power Plan & Other E.P.A. Rules,” which included, according to the agenda, Scott Pruitt, then the attorney general of Oklahoma; Ken Paxton, Texas’ attorney general; and Geoffrey Barnes, a corporate lawyer for Murray, which had donated $250,000 to the Republican attorneys general political group. That same day, Mr. Morrissey would step outside the hotel  to announce  that he and other attorneys general would sue in federal court to try to stop the Clean Power Plan, which he called “the most far-reaching energy regulation in this nation’s history, drawn up by radical bureaucrats.” Mr. Pruitt  quickly beca me  a national point person for industry-backed groups and a magnet for millions of dollars of campaign contributions, as the fossil fuel lobby looked for a fresh face with conservative credentials and ties to the evangelical community. “Pruitt was instrumental — he and A.G. Morrisey,” said Thomas Pyle,  a former lobbyist  for Koch Industries, an adviser to Mr. Trump’s transition team and the president of a pro-fossil fuel Washington research organization, the Institute for Energy Research. “They led the charge and made it easier for other states to get involved. Some states were keeping their powder dry, but Pruitt was very out front and aggressive.” After  the litigation was filed  — by Mr. Morrissey and Mr. Pruitt, along with other attorneys general who attended the Greenbrier meeting — Murray Energy sued in the federal court case as well, just as had been planned. In February 2016, the  Supreme Court indicated  that it would side with opponents of the rule, moving by a 5-4 vote to grant a request by the attorneys general and corporate players to block the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while the case worked its way through the federal courts. When Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, he did not appear to have a clear understanding of the nation’s climate change policies. Nor, at the start of his campaign, did he appear to have any specific plan to prioritize a huge legal push to roll those policies back. Mr. Trump had, in 2012,  said on Twitter , “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” But he had also, in 2009, joined dozens of other business leaders to sign  a full-page ad  in the The New York Times urging Mr. Obama to push a global climate change pact being negotiated in Copenhagen, and to “strengthen and pass United States legislation” to tackle climate change. However, it did not go unnoticed that coal country was giving his presidential campaign a wildly enthusiastic embrace, as miners came out in full force for Mr. Trump, stoking his populist message. And the surest way for Mr. Trump to win cheers from coal crowds was to aim at an easy target: Mr. Obama’s climate rules. Hillary Clinton did not help her cause when she  said last spring  that her climate policies would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” In May 2016, Mr. Trump  addressed one of the largest rallies of his campaign : an estimated crowd of over 10,000 in Charleston, W.Va., where the front rows were crammed with mine workers. “I’m thinking about miners all over the country,” he said, eliciting cheers. “We’re going to put miners back to work.” “They didn’t used to have all these rules and regulations that make it impossible to compete,” he added. “We’re going to take it all off the table.” Then an official from the West Virginia Coal Association handed the candidate a miner’s hat. As he put it on, giving the miners a double thumbs-up, “The place just went nuts, and he loved it,” recalled  Barry Bennett , a former adviser to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. “And the miners started showing up at everything. They were a beaten lot, and they saw him as a savior. So he started using the ‘save coal’ portions of the speech again and again.” Mr. Trump’s advisers embraced the miners as emblematic of the candidate’s broader populist appeal. “The coal miners were the perfect case for what he was talking about,” Mr. Bennett said, “the idea that for the government in Washington, it’s all right for these people to suffer for the greater good — that federal power is more important than your little lives.” Mr. Trump took on as an informal campaign adviser Robert E. Murray — chief executive of the same coal company that had been working closely for years with the Republican attorneys general to unwind the Obama environmental legacy. Mr. Murray, a brash and folksy populist who started working in coal mines as a teenager, is an unabashed skeptic of climate science. The coal magnate and Mr. Trump had a natural chemistry, and where Mr. Trump lacked the legal and policy background to unwind climate policy, Mr. Murray was happy to step in. “I thank my lord, Jesus Christ, for the election of Donald Trump,” Mr. Murray said soon after his new friend won the White House. Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Ebell, the Competitive Enterprise Institute fellow who had worked for years to undermine the legitimacy of established climate science, to head the transition team at E.P.A. Mr. Ebell immediately began pushing for an agenda of gutting the Obama climate regulations and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. When it came time to translate Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to coal country into policy, Mr. Murray and others helped choose the perfect candidate: Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general. Mr. Trump, who had never met Mr. Pruitt before his election, offered him the job of E.P.A. administrator — putting him in a position to dismantle the environmental rules that he had long  sought to fight in court . Meanwhile, Mr. Trump wanted to be seen delivering on the promises he had made to the miners. As controversies piled up in his young administration, he sought comfort in the approval of his base. In March, Mr. Trump signed  an executive order  directing Mr. Pruitt to begin unwinding the Clean Power Plan — and he did so at a large public ceremony at the E.P.A., flanked by coal miners and coal executives. Mr. Murray beamed in the audience. Meanwhile, a battle raged at the White House over whether to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement. Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, urged him to remain in, cautioning that withdrawing could be devastating to the United States’ foreign policy credentials. Murray Energy — despite its enormous clout with Mr. Trump and his top environmental official — boasts a payroll with only 6,000 employees. The coal industry nationwide is  responsible for  about  160,000 jobs,  with just 65,000 directly in mining, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. By comparison,  General Electric  alone has 104,000 employees in the United States, and  Apple  has 80,000. Their chief executives openly pressed Mr. Trump to stick with Paris, as did dozens of other major corporations that have continued to support regulatory efforts to combat climate change. But these voices did not have clout in Washington, either in Congress or at the White House, when it comes to energy policy. Mr. Trump’s senior adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, backed by Mr. Pruitt, told the president that pulling out of the deal would mean a promise kept to his base. “It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — along with many, many other locations within our great country — before Paris, France,” Mr. Trump said in his  Rose Garden speech  on Thursday. “It is time to make America great again.” The recognition that human activity is influencing the climate developed slowly, but a scientific consensus can be traced to  a conference in southern Austria  in October 1985. Among the 100 or so attendees who gathered in the city of Villach, nestled in the mountains along the Drava River, was  Bert Bolin , a Swedish meteorologist and a pioneer in using computers to model the climate. Dr. Bolin helped steer the conference to its conclusion: “It is now believed that in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature could occur which is greater than any in man’s history,” he wrote in the conference’s 500-page report. While the politics of climate change in the United States has grown more divided since then, the scientific community has united: Global warming is having an impact, scientists say, with sea levels rising along with the extremity of weather events. Most of the debate is about the extent of those impacts — how high the seas may rise, or how intense and frequent heavy storms or heat waves may be. In recent years, many climate scientists have also dropped their reluctance to pin significant weather events on climate change. Studies have shown that certain events — a  2015 Australian heat wave ,  floods in France  last year and recent high temperatures in the Arctic — were  made more likely because of global warming . But in Congress, reluctance to embrace that science has had no political downsides, at least among Republicans. “We don’t yet have an example of where someone has paid a political price being on that side of it,” said Michael Steel, who served as press secretary for the former House speaker John A. Boehner, the Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and the current House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, during his 2012 run as Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential choice. Instead, the messages of Mr. Pruitt still dominate. “This is an historic restoration of American economic independence — one that will benefit the working class, the working poor and working people of all stripes,” Mr. Pruitt said on Thursday, stepping to the Rose Garden lectern after Mr. Trump. “We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.” American voters — even many Republicans — recognize that  climate change is starting to affect their lives . About 70 percent think global warming is happening, and about 53 percent think it is caused by human activities, according to  a recent study  by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. About 69 percent support limiting carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. But most public opinion polls find that voters rank the environment last or nearly last among the issues that they vote on. And views are divided based on party affiliation. In 2001, 46 percent of Democrats said they worried “a great deal” about climate change, compared with 29 percent of Republicans, according to a Gallup tracking poll on the issue. This year, concern among Democrats has reached 66 percent. Among Republicans, it has fallen, to 18 percent. Until people vote on the issue, Republicans will find it politically safer to question climate science and policy than to alienate moneyed groups like Americans for Prosperity. There will be exceptions. The  2014 National Climate Assessment , a report produced by 14 federal agencies, concluded that climate change is responsible for much of the flooding now plaguing many of the Miami area’s coastal residents, soaking homes and disrupting businesses, and Representative Curbelo is talking about it. “This is a local issue for me,” Mr. Curbelo said. “Even conservatives in my district see the impact. It’s flooding, and it’s happening now.” Mr. Curbelo helped create the House Climate Solutions Caucus,  20 Republicans and 20 Democrats  who say they are committed to tackling climate change. Mr. Curbelo is confident that as the impact of climate change spreads, so will the willingness of his Republican colleagues to join him. Outside of Congress, a small number of establishment conservatives, including a handful of leaders from the Reagan administration, have begun pushing Washington to act on climate change. Earlier this year, James A. Baker III, one of the Republican Party’s more eminent senior figures, met with senior White House officials to urge them to consider incorporating a carbon tax as part of a broader tax overhaul package — a way to both pay for proposed cuts to corporate tax rates and help save the planet. A Reagan White House senior economist, Art Laffer; a former secretary of state, George P. Shultz; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., George W. Bush’s final Treasury secretary, have also pushed the idea. “There are members from deep-red districts who have approached me about figuring out how to become part of this effort,” Mr. Curbelo said. “I know we have the truth on our side. So I’m confident that we’ll win — eventually.”',\n",
       " 'TAORMINA, Sicily — President Trump declined to endorse the Paris climate accords on Saturday, ending his first foreign trip much as he began it: at odds with several of the nation’s allies and under a cloud of questions back home about his ties to Russia. Mr. Trump refused to bend on the pact after three days of contentious private debate and  intense lobbying  by other leaders that began Wednesday with an appeal by Pope Francis. The six other nations in the Group of 7 reaffirmed their commitment to cutting greenhouse-gas emissions in a  joint statement  issued Saturday. The stalemate leaves the country’s future role in the climate accord in flux, though Mr. Trump promised to make a decision in the week ahead on whether the United States will be the first of 195 signatories to pull out. Mr. Trump returned home on Saturday night to a White House in crisis after a nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe that was book-ended by new disclosures about links between his aides and Russia. The climate accord was the most vivid sign of division between the United States and its allies, but it was not the only one: Mr. Trump also  scolded Germany  for its trade practices and  lectured NATO members  for not adequately supporting the alliance. “There was a lot of give-and-take between the different countries in the room,” said Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council. But he insisted that the other countries understood Mr. Trump’s refusal to decide now, even if they did not support that position. “The president’s only been in office for a certain period of time, and they respect that,” Mr. Cohn said. He added: “We’re all allies. We’re all trying to get to the right place and be respectful of each other.” While Mr. Trump’s decision was not a surprise, the reaction was swift and critical. Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: “President Trump’s continued waffling on whether to stay in or withdraw from the Paris Agreement made it impossible to reach consensus at the Taormina summit on the need for ambitious climate action. But he stands in stark isolation.” The leaders of Germany and France expressed disappointment. “The whole discussion about climate was very difficult, not to say unsatisfactory,” Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said. “There’s a situation where it’s six — if you count the European Union, seven — against one.” President Emmanuel Macron of France said he had told Mr. Trump it was “indispensable for the reputation of the United States and for the Americans themselves that the Americans remain committed” to the climate agreement. The G-7 statement provides the United States more time to resolve internal White House debates about whether to pull out of the pact. It says the United States is “in the process of reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics.” The president did not mention the impasse in his only public remarks after the summit meeting, to American troops at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily. But he repeated his complaints about trade and the financing of NATO, even as he pronounced the trip a rousing success. “We hit a home run no matter where we are,” he said. For Mr. Trump, however, the lack of a decision on the climate accord put an uncertain ending on an ambitious first presidential trip abroad that began as a respite from the surfeit of scandal at home. Beleaguered White House aides — who were aboard Air Force One flying to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, when they heard reports that Mr. Trump had  called his former F.B.I. director a “nut job”  — had hoped the trip would offer a much-needed change of subject. And to some degree, it did, if only because the White House engineered the itinerary to keep Mr. Trump far away from reporters who could ask him questions. They scheduled no news conferences and put the president only in highly controlled situations: a brief photo session with a foreign leader; a teleprompter speech; ceremonial gatherings with other leaders. But on Saturday, as his aides tried to promote the trip’s accomplishments, reporters bombarded them with questions about reports that Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, had talked about opening  a secret back channel to Russia  during the transition. “We’re not going to comment on Jared,” an exasperated Mr. Cohn said. In some ways, it was not one trip, but two, each with very different themes. In  Saudi Arabia  and  Israel , Mr. Trump was surprisingly disciplined, sticking to his script and delivering two speeches that set a clear course for his approach to the Middle East. His rapturous welcome in both countries suggested that the United States could make a new start with allies who had grown restive during the Obama administration. In Europe, however, the pugnacious side of Mr. Trump reasserted itself. In addition to offering a harangue of NATO members over budgetary matters, he declined to explicitly reaffirm America’s commitment to Article 5, which requires the United States to come to the defense of allies in the event of an attack. He also won derisive headlines across the Continent after  muscling aside the prime minister of Montenegro  during a photo shoot, an image that quickly became a metaphor for his rough dealings with Europeans. “His advisers tried to make him understand that there are some allies that are really nervous and needed reassurance,” said Volker Perthes, the director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “He managed to do it with the Saudis and the Israelis.” But in Europe, he said, “he does take us for granted.” Brian McKeon, a senior policy official in the Pentagon during the Obama administration, said: “The in-your-face thing at the NATO headquarters was pretty undiplomatic. He succeeded at busting norms, but not building good will.” The American national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, said that Mr. Trump’s participation in the ceremony was an implicit endorsement of Article 5. “He did not make a decision not to say it,” General McMaster said. On climate, Mr. Trump has long railed against what he says are the economic dangers of a global climate pact. He has demanded more flexibility in setting standards on emissions, saying other countries are getting a better deal and that the agreement could be costly for American businesses. In a  message on Twitter  on Saturday, he said, “I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!” There is an intense debate inside the West Wing over whether to withdraw from the accord or to try to renegotiate its terms, pitting hard-line nationalists, like Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist, against more mainstream advisers like Mr. Cohn. On Thursday, Mr. Cohn told reporters that Mr. Trump’s thinking on the subject was “evolving.” But other senior officials said that even if the United States remained in the agreement, it could effectively gut its principles. The exit of the United States, the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China, would not immediately dissolve the pact, which was negotiated under President Barack Obama and legally ratified last year. But it would profoundly weaken the strength of the deal and pave the way for other countries to withdraw from it. Some climate diplomats said the rest of the world was growing weary of America’s back-and-forth on climate change policy. In 1997, the United States joined the world’s first climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, but later withdrew during the Bush administration. “At some juncture, other countries are going to get sick of us joining in, pulling out, joining in and pulling out and say, ‘Are we really going to work with the U.S. on this anymore?’” said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton. Mr. Trump’s supporters, particularly coal-state Republicans, are eager for him to withdraw from the Paris accord, and see such a move as a fulfillment of a signature campaign promise. Speaking to a crowd of oil-rig workers last May, Mr. Trump vowed to “cancel” the agreement. Coal miners and coal executives in states like Kentucky and West Virginia have pushed hard for Mr. Trump to reverse all of Mr. Obama’s climate change policies, which are ultimately aimed at reducing the widespread burning of coal. In a recent letter to Mr. Trump from 10 state attorneys general, West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, wrote, “Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement is an important and necessary step toward reversing the harmful energy policies and unlawful overreach of the Obama era.” On trade, Mr. Trump pushed his demand that any agreements negotiated by the United States must be fair. The Trump administration has taken particular aim at Germany, accusing it of depressing the value of the euro to make its exports more competitive and to undercut American goods. In a meeting with leaders of the European Union in Brussels on Thursday, Mr. Trump complained about imports of German cars, threatening to stop them and calling Germany “very bad” on trade. German officials point out that its two leading luxury automakers, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, have huge assembly plants in the United States. They are also frustrated that Trump officials repeatedly raise the prospect of negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with Germany, something that the country, as a member of the European Union, cannot do. Shortly after Air Force One took off from Sicily for Washington, Mr. Trump  said on Twitter  that he had enjoyed “great” meetings on trade, saying, “We push for the removal of all trade-distorting practices....to foster a truly level playing field.”',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — Momentous arguments inside the West Wing over the future of the Paris climate accord became a messy public spectacle on Wednesday, with some aides saying that President Trump had decided to abandon the landmark global warming agreement while others insisted that no decision had been made. Three administration officials with direct knowledge of the intense White House debate said early Wednesday morning that Mr. Trump was expected to withdraw the United States from the 2015  climate change  accord that committed nearly every nation to take action to curb the warming of the planet. In addition, three other officials said later Wednesday that they expected him to withdraw from the agreement, though they said that decision could still change. Hours later, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had made his decision and would announce it in the Rose Garden at 3 p.m. Thursday. The White House’s legislative affairs office has suggested another route: Sending the Paris agreement to the Senate for ratification as a treaty. Since it would require an impossible two-thirds vote, that alternative would also lead to withdrawal. Other White House insiders disputed those reports, saying that no verdict had been reached. Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, offered only that “I’m hearing from a lot of people, both ways,” and promised a decision “very soon.” With the world watching nervously, the feuding among the president’s aides further exposed the fault lines of a chaotic decision-making process that has swirled around Mr. Trump since he took office. Signs have been increasing for weeks that Mr. Trump was heading toward pulling out of the Paris agreement, apparently believing that a continued United States presence in the accord would harm the economy; hinder job creation in regions like Appalachia and the West, where his most ardent supporters live; and undermine his “America first” message. At home, he faced urgent pleas from corporate leaders, including Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, who told Mr. Trump on Tuesday that pulling out was wrong for business, the economy and the environment. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, threatened to resign from two White House advisory boards if the president withdrew from the Paris agreement. On his recent trip to Europe, Mr. Trump waved aside a barrage of private lobbying by other heads of state to keep the United States in the agreement. A frustrated Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said he opposed “behaving as vassals of the Americans” and assailed Mr. Trump for failing to even understand the mechanics of a withdrawal, which he said could take three or four years to fulfill. “This notion — ‘I am Trump. I am American. America first, so I’m going to get out of it.’ — that is not going to happen,” Mr. Juncker said. “We tried to make that clear to Mr. Trump in clear, German principal clauses in Taormina, but it would appear that he did not understand.” He added, “Not everything in international agreements is fake news.” Mr. Trump has shown a willingness to shift direction up until the moment of a public announcement. He met on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who has advocated that the United States remain a part of the Paris accord. Other advisers pressing Mr. Trump to remain were furiously making their case. In the past, such appeals have worked. In April, Mr. Trump was set to announce a withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement, but at the last minute changed his mind after intense discussions with advisers and calls from the leaders of Canada and Mexico. Last week, a senior administration official said Mr. Trump would use a speech in Brussels to explicitly endorse NATO’s Article 5 mutual defense provision, which states that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all. He did not. The exit of the United States, the world’s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas polluter, would not dissolve the 195-nation pact, which was legally ratified last year, but it could set off a cascade of events that would have profound effects on the planet. Other countries that reluctantly joined the agreement could now withdraw or soften their commitments to cutting planet-warming pollution. “The actions of the United States are bound to have a ripple effect in other emerging economies that are just getting serious about climate change, such as India, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton, and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group that produces scientific reports aimed at informing global policy makers. Once the fallout settles, he added, “it is now far more likely that we will breach the danger limit of 3.6 degrees” — the average atmospheric temperature increase above which a future of extreme conditions is considered irrevocable. The aim of the Paris agreement was to lower planet-warming emissions enough to avoid that threshold. “We will see more extreme heat, damaging storms, coastal flooding and risks to food security,” Professor Oppenheimer said. “And that’s not the kind of world we want to live in.” Foreign policy experts said the move could damage the United States’ credibility and weaken Mr. Trump’s efforts to negotiate issues far beyond climate change, like trade and terrorism. “From a foreign policy perspective, it’s a colossal mistake — an abdication of American leadership,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a retired career diplomat and an under secretary of state for President George W. Bush. “The success of our foreign policy — in trade, military, any other kind of negotiation — depends on our credibility,” Mr. Burns said. “I can’t think of anything more destructive to our credibility than this.” But Mr. Trump’s supporters, particularly coal-state Republicans, have cheered the move, celebrating it as a fulfillment of a signature campaign promise. Speaking to a crowd of oil rig workers last year, Mr. Trump vowed to “cancel” the agreement, and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, has pushed the president to withdraw from the accord as part of an economic nationalism that has so far included pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade pact, and vowing to renegotiate Nafta. Coal miners and coal company executives in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia have pushed for Mr. Trump to reverse all of President Barack Obama’s climate change policies, many of which are aimed at reducing the use of coal, considered the largest contributor to climate change. In a May 23 letter to Mr. Trump from Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia and nine other state attorneys general, Mr. Morrisey wrote, “Withdrawing from the Paris agreement is an important and necessary step toward reversing the harmful energy policies and unlawful overreach of the Obama era.” He added, “The Paris agreement is a symbol of the Obama administration’s ‘Washington knows best’ approach to governing.” Although the administration has been debating its position on the Paris agreement for months, the sentiment for leaving appears to have the upper hand over the views of Mr. Tillerson and Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and close adviser. Other countries have vowed to continue to carry out the terms of the Paris agreement, even without the United States. President Xi Jinping of China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas polluter, has promised that his country will move ahead with steps to curb climate change, regardless of what happens in the United States. During a telephone call in early May with President Emmanuel Macron of France, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Mr. Xi told the newly elected French leader that China and France “should protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement.” But the accord’s architects say the absence of the United States will inevitably weaken its chances of being enforced. For example, the country has played a central role in pushing provisions that require robust and transparent oversight of how emissions are monitored, verified and reported. Without the United States, there is likely to be far less pressure on major polluting countries and industries to accurately report their emissions. There have been major questions raised about the accuracy of China’s emissions reporting, in particular. “We need to know: What are your emissions? Where are your emissions?” said Todd D. Stern, the lead climate negotiator during the Obama administration. “There needs to be transparent reporting on countries’ greenhouse gas emissions. If the U.S. is not part of that negotiation, that’s a loss for the world.”',\n",
       " 'Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can  sign up here  to receive  Climate Fwd: , our new email newsletter. CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The Environmental Protection Agency convened a public hearing on Tuesday on its plan to roll back the signature climate change rule of the Obama administration. More than 270 people signed up to speak. The regulation, known as  Clean Power Plan , would require states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, particularly those that burn coal. The plan, finalized in 2015, would have accelerated a shift already underway from coal-generated power to natural gas and renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. The proposal sparked a bitter fight from coal interests and from many conservative state officials. The former Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, was one of the officials in 29 states who filed a lawsuit to fight the plan. President Trump named Mr. Pruitt head of the E.P.A., where he has made it a top priority to reverse what he has called the Obama administration’s “war on coal.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt, like many other administration officials, question the overwhelming scientific evidence that climate change is mainly caused by human activity — a conclusion repeated this month  by the government’s own scientists  in 13 federal agencies. As part of a broad effort to uproot the environmental policies of the Obama administration, Mr. Pruitt announced in October that he would kill the Clean Power Plan, which he said did not follow regulatory norms and imposed undue burdens on states and energy producers. Tuesday’s public hearing was a required part of undoing the regulation. Mr. Pruitt did not attend. Holding the hearing in West Virginia “is like holding the only hearing on financial deregulation at the Wall Street Hilton — it does not denote a keen interest in alternative views,”  Michael B. Gerrard , the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said in an interview last week. So many people  requested time to speak  that they were spread out over three meeting rooms in the state capitol during the two days set aside for the hearing. During the morning hearing,  Patrick Morrisey , the attorney general of West Virginia, led off the speakers, saying that the power plan “is not only unlawful, but it’s bad policy as well.” He led the coalition of states that sued to stop the power plan. The  Supreme Court in February delayed  enforcement of the regulation. (In similar fashion, a number of Democratic state attorneys general, including  Maura Healey  of Massachusetts and  Eric T. Schneiderman  of New York, have pledged to fight the repeal in court.) Robert E. Murray , founder and president of Murray Energy, a major coal producer, exulted, “In President Trump, we finally have a president who has vowed to preserve coal jobs.” The Obama administration’s rule, which he called the “so-called and illegal Clean Power Plan, better known as the no-power plan,” would impose “massive costs on the power sector and American consumers” while eliminating even more coal jobs. Before the hearing began, Mr. Murray warmly greeted dozens of miners whom his company brought in by bus for the event. “You all know you have to work the afternoon shift now,” he joked. Several groups are also holding an alternate hearing across the Kanawha River, at the University of Charleston, to discuss the environmental, health and climate benefits of reducing coal consumption. “The Clean Power Plan has a lot of support,” said Bill Price, a local organizer for the Sierra Club who grew up in the area and whose father worked in the coal mines. Since the shift to power sources like solar and wind create jobs and clean the environment, he said, the Clean Power Plan is “pro-worker, pro-economy and it’s pro-environment.” Some of the speakers marveled at the turnaround on environmental regulation that a change in administrations had wrought. Speaking in favor of repeal,  Bill Raney , president of the West Virginia Coal Association said, “I don’t think we have ever testified in favor of anything the E.P.A. has ever done.” Opponents of repeal attending the hearing offered rebuttal.  Jim Probst , West Virginia coordinator for Citizens Climate Lobby, said that he was speaking with future generations in mind, and said that it was wrong to blame regulations for coal’s woes. “The reality is that  the coal industry has been in decline for many years .” Liz Perera , climate policy director of the Sierra Club, testified that the Trump administration had “inappropriately  cooked the books ” on the costs and benefits of the plan. “This is about the kind of world we will leave for our children,” she said. Stanley Sturgill , a retired Kentucky coal miner who has become an activist, started out at 3 a.m. to get to the hearing. Now 71 and afflicted with black lung and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, he called repealing the plan “immoral and indefensible.” He repeated a comment he gave in support of the plan in 2014: “We’re dying, literally dying, for you to help us.” Coal-fired power plants are a major source of greenhouse gases: they produce  about one-third  of the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions. This is the sole hearing scheduled on repealing the plan; the Obama administration held four such hearings in creating it. A spokesman for the E.P.A. said, “We continue to assess the needs for additional hearings, and in the meantime encourage all stakeholders to submit their comments to the public docket, which will be open until January 16, 2018.”',\n",
       " 'It was the rarest of news in the coal mining hollows of Appalachia: A once powerful executive, Donald Blankenship,  was sentenced  Wednesday to a year in prison for conspiring to violate federal mine safety laws at the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia, where 29 workers died in an explosion six years ago. The very idea that a dominant baron of the industry called King Coal could be brought to justice and put behind bars shook the region, where miners have long complained that they face dangerous and illegal working conditions that routinely result in no punishment. Mr. Blankenship, who served as chief executive of the  Massey Energy  Company, was not accused of causing the explosion, but his management methods, so notoriously focused on profitability, came under investigation after the disaster and led to his federal conviction on a misdemeanor  charge in December  in a Charleston courthouse. While Mr. Blankenship sought probation and maintained his innocence at sentencing, Judge Irene Berger  delivered  the maximum one-year sentence, citing “your part in a dangerous conspiracy” aimed at “putting profitability of the company ahead of the safety of your employees.” The mine disaster, America’s worst in modern times, was traced to flammable coal dust and gas that accumulated despite workers’ complaints to management. The  mine’s history  of thousands of violations was laid bare by investigators, with Mr. Blankenship maintaining that health and safety were uppermost concerns at the mine. Autopsies on the 29 victims told a different story of a hard work routine, with 71 percent showing signs of the incurable coal dust affliction called black lung — far above the industry average of 3.2 percent. The mining executive was acquitted on felony charges, which involved accusations of securities fraud and making false statements and could have brought him decades in prison. Several of his lower-ranking supervisors were convicted earlier on felony charges for covering up hazardous conditions. Immediately after the disaster, there were assorted proposals for tougher federal mine and safety penalties, including upgrading the conspiracy violation to a felony with a longer sentence. But these have gone nowhere in the Republican Congress, compounding the tragedy of Upper Big Branch. Mr. Blankenship was a hard-driving executive who demanded productivity reports every 30 minutes. He retired after the explosion with a $12 million golden parachute. “This game is about money,” he was heard emphasizing in one recorded comment uncovered in the investigation. Judge Berger reminded the convicted coal baron that there was more than money at stake: “You, Mr. Blankenship, created a culture of noncompliance at Upper Big Branch where your subordinates accepted and, in fact, encouraged unsafe working conditions in order to reach profitability and production targets.”',\n",
       " 'EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — When the Giants were embarrassingly inept in their season-opening loss to the Dallas Cowboys, the glaring lack of offense was blamed on an ankle injury that kept the All-Pro wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. out of the game. It turns out that even Beckham’s vast, distinctive talents can be overestimated. Beckham returned to the Giants’ lineup to face the Detroit Lions on Monday night, but he could not make up for another shabby performance by his team’s offensive line. He was unable to make the Giants feeble running game potent. The Giants still struggled to mount sustained offensive drives. And Beckham himself looked out of rhythm, which was understandable given his injury layoff. He had little effect on the game, catching just four passes for 36 yards. The result was a 24-10 Lions victory here at MetLife Stadium, a defeat that perilously set back the Giants’ season. They began the year talked up as a Super Bowl contender, but with an 0-2 record and two difficult road games at the Philadelphia Eagles and Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the next two weeks, the Giants could soon be facing a daunting road to contend for a playoff spot. Detroit’s victory, spurred by a swarming defense, improved their record to 2-0. The Giants never led in the game and barely threatened to rally after the Lions took a commanding two-touchdown lead early in the fourth quarter with Jamal Agnew’s 88-yard punt return for a touchdown. The Giants did have opportunities. Two of their drives in the fourth quarter ended with fourth-down failures. On the first fourth down, near midfield, the officials initially ruled that Giants running back Shane Vereen had picked up the first down with a three-yard reception. But Detroit challenged the spot of the ball, and after a video review the ball was moved back about 18 inches, enough to turn over the football on downs to the Lions. Later in the quarter, another Giants fourth down try inside the Detroit 30-yard line failed when a pass to Beckham fell incomplete. Manning completed 22 of 32 passes for 239 passing yards and one touchdown, an 18-yard connection to the rookie tight end Evan Engram. Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford connected on 15 of 21 passes for 122 yards and two touchdowns. A 27-yard touchdown grab by Marvin Jones Jr. gave the Lions a 7-0 lead, and tight end Eric Ebron hauled in a 7-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter. After trailing by 17-7 at the half, the Giants began the third quarter with more bumbling play, especially by the offensive line. Manning, who had been sacked four times in the first half, was dragged down in the pocket again on the second play of the second half. Detroit defensive end Ezekiel Ansah blew past Ereck Flowers, the Giants’ overmatched left tackle, for his third sack of the game. Flowers, who had a dreadful outing in the Giants’ season-opening loss to Dallas — and was a glaring disappointment last season as well — was no better Monday night. In fact, he may be regressing. And the Giants coaching staff is most likely wondering how long it can continue to start Flowers, the team’s 2015 first-round draft choice, at a crucial position like left tackle. A 38-yard pass from Manning to the backup tight end Jerell Adams followed by a 17-yard completion to Brandon Marshall gave the Giants the ball at the Detroit 1-yard line near the midpoint of the third quarter. But a holding penalty on guard Brett Jones on the first play after Adams’s reception pushed the Giants back 10 yards. The Giants advanced to the Lions’ 2-yard and lined up for a fourth-and-goal attempt at a touchdown, but another Giants miscue — a delay-of-game penalty — forced the Giants to instead settle for a 25-yard field goal by kicker Aldrick Rosas. The Giants played the game without two key defensive starters. The team’s best cornerback, Janoris Jenkins, did not dress for the game because of a hand injury and linebacker B.J. Goodson, the team’s leading tackler, was sidelined by a leg injury. On the Giants’ first series, just after Manning was sacked for the first time, right tackle Bobby Hart limped off the field after re-aggravating an ankle injury. Hart did not return.',\n",
       " 'HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — Melania Trump, a  once-reluctant first lady  who has lately been ramping up her travels as well as directing her aides to  lash out at rivals , allowed the public a glimpse at her nascent platform on Tuesday at a clinic that treats infants born with addiction. Mrs. Trump flew about 400 miles to this western edge of the state. Her visit is a signal that her interests — so far stated broadly as helping children and combating cyberbullying — have narrowed, at least for now, to focus on learning more about the opioid epidemic. More than two million Americans are estimated to have problems with opioids, and  Appalachia has some of the highest overdose rates  in the country. “Please tell me how I can help,” Mrs. Trump told staff members and former clients of  Lily’s Place , which was established in 2014 and has so far treated around 190 babies suffering from  n eonatal a bstinence s yndrome . “That’s why I’m here. I want to listen to your stories; I want to hear what I can do to help.” The short answer, according Rebecca Crowder, the clinic’s executive director: money. “We still battle with funding, obviously,” Ms. Crowder told the first lady. “We haven’t gotten to that point where they recognize us through Medicaid.” The brief exchange raises questions about how Mrs. Trump could help address the issue. The latest Republican-driven effort to  repeal the Affordable Care Act  would have dismantled the Medicaid expansion and capped open-ended funding of the program, an entitlement that covers one in five Americans. In an eight-minute appearance in front of reporters, Mrs. Trump said her goal for the visit, which lasted about an hour, was to help “give a voice” to families facing addiction. “We need to open the conversation and teach children and young mothers that it’s dangerous to use drugs,” Mrs. Trump said. Accompanying the first lady to Lily’s Place was Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, and Dr. Elinore F. McCance-Katz, the assistant secretary of health and human services for mental health and substance use. Mrs. Trump’s visit could be seen as a boost to Representative Evan Jenkins, a Republican who helped found the clinic and who is challenging Senator  Joe Manchin III , a former governor of the state, for his seat in 2018. Mr. Jenkins, who greeted the first lady after she landed in West Virginia, said in an interview that he had met several times with White House aides to talk about Lily’s Place, and that he personally discussed the clinic with Mr. Trump aboard Air Force One. Having the first lady’s attention, Mr. Jenkins said, was “particularly impactful” to his cause. In May, Mr. Jenkins wrote and introduced the  Caring Recovery for Infants and Babies Act  that would allow families needing treatment at a clinic like Lily’s Place to be covered through Medicaid. “Having her voice behind it will be very, very important,” he said. Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s communications director, said that Mrs. Trump had chosen Lily’s Place because it was brought up often in the “many conversations she’s had on the topic.” Others who are hoping for the White House to push for more resources and policy changes watched Mrs. Trump’s visit with interest. Jessica Hulsey Nickel, the president and chief executive of the Addiction Policy Forum, a group of organizations working to elevate awareness of the opioid crisis, said that a visit from the first lady — even a brief one — could help her cause. “The more awareness and the brighter spotlight that we shine on this issue,” she said, “the more likely we are to get the resources and new strategies that we need.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  found  in a report released last year that the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome climbed to six per 1,000 hospital births in 2013, up from 1.5 per 1,000 in 1999. In 2012, one infant with the illness  was born  every 25 minutes. Mrs. Trump has not unveiled concrete plans to move forward with her platform, and many observers are still trying to read the tea leaves regarding her comfort with White House life. She is, apparently, at least comfortable with her title. On Monday, Mrs. Trump found herself in a tangle with her husband’s first wife, Ivana Trump, who jokingly referred to herself as “first lady” while promoting her new memoir. “Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President. She loves living in Washington, D.C., and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States,” Ms. Grisham said in an email on Monday. “She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books.”',\n",

       " 'EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — If the last two games are any indication, the Los Angeles Rams are for real — and then some. Jared Goff set career highs with four touchdown throws and 311 yards passing, Todd Gurley ran for two more scores, and the surprising Rams made one big play after another in beating the defenseless Giants, 51-17, on Sunday. The win was the fifth in six games for the Rams, whose 6-2 start is the franchise’s best since 2001, when the club went 14-2 in the regular season and eventually lost to the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. What’s even more impressive is that 31-year-old Sean McVay’s team has won the last two games by a combined 84-17 margin, including a 33-0 win over the Arizona Cardinals in London. Goff played down the success. “Eight games in, eight games in,” he warned. “You’ve seen it in the past. Teams start out hot and don’t finish the season that way, or vice versa. We need to go week to week right now. We’re excited about where we’re at, for sure. Six and two is really good. We finished the second quarter of the season 3-1. That’s really good. But we have half the season to go.” McVay said the Rams’ last two games have been almost perfect in all three phases, and they have remained unbeaten in four road games. That would be five if a “home” win in London is included. The Rams’ high-powered offense showed no rust as the team came off the bye, scoring on eight of its first nine possessions while reeling off six plays of 35 yards or more. The defense forced three turnovers that the offense turned into 17 points, and the special teams blocked a third-quarter punt that paved the way for Gurley’s second touchdown. “It’s exciting,” said Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson, who intercepted a pass by Giants quarterback Eli Manning late in the first half. “A lot of guys in this locker room haven’t been in this situation, 6-2. It’s big, and every game is going to be more important, so we are doing everything one game at a time, one day at a time.” Greg Zuerlein added three field goals against the Giants (1-7), who allowed the biggest offensive performance against them in a home game since Cleveland beat them, 52-21, in the regular-season finale in 1964. The Giants had not given up more than 27 points in any of their first seven games. “You lay an egg like that — obviously we didn’t play well,” Giants halfback Orleans Darkwa said. “We’ve got to go back to work. We started fast. We made some plays. We put on a good drive. But we wound up turning the ball over, and you can’t do that.” The loss also put Coach Ben McAdoo’s future in question just one year after he led the team to the playoffs. He suspended cornerback Janoris Jenkins on Tuesday for missing a workout Monday, and the depleted secondary was punished by Goff, who was 14 of 22 with no interceptions. “I’m disappointed,” said McAdoo, who insisted his team had not quit. “Expected us to come out and play a better football game than we played. We have it in us. It’s my job to get it out of us.” Goff’s touchdowns were of 8 yards to tight end Tyler Higbee, 52 to Robert Woods, 67 to Sammy Watkins and 4 to Woods. Eli Manning (20 of 36 for 220 yards) threw two touchdown passes and became the seventh N.F.L. quarterback to reach the 50,000-yard mark with his completion of a garbage-time pass to Sterling Shepard in the fourth quarter. His touchdowns covered 5 yards to Tavarres King and 10 yards to Evan Engram. Goff’s touchdown pass to Higbee came after Aaron Donald sacked Manning and forced a fumble that Connor Barwin recovered. The play that killed the Giants was the 52-yarder to Woods on a third-and-33 screen play on which Woods was barely touched. It turned a 10-7 lead into a 10-point advantage, and the Gians never looked the same in seeing their seven-game winning streak against the Rams end.',\n",

       " ' ATHENS, Ohio — Hillary Clinton typically ignores protesters who confront her on the campaign trail, but she fired back at one high-profile rabble-rouser who had stood outside her West Virginia event on Monday. “I heard Mr. Blankenship was outside my event yesterday protesting me,” Mrs. Clinton said on Tuesday, referring to Donald L. Blankenship, the former chairman and chief executive of the Massey Energy Company. Mr. Blankenship, one of the wealthiest men in Appalachia, was  sentenced in April to a year in prison  for conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards after an explosion killed 29 men in 2010. Mr. Blankenship, who is set begin his sentence within months, had stood in solidarity on Monday with the anti-Clinton protesters in Williamson, W.Va., many of whom appeared to be coal workers and held signs supporting the Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump. They chanted “Go home, Hillary!” and “Bring back our jobs!” as the former of secretary of state walked into a health and wellness center in Williamson, in Mingo County, an area of West Virginia particularly hard hit by the downturn in coal jobs. “If Donald Trump wants the support of someone like that, he can have it,” Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, said at a rally here on Tuesday, pointing to legislation she supported that would put into effect additional workplace safety measures and attempt to hold executives accountable. She said Mr. Blankenship “had neglected workers’ safety for years” before the  2010 explosion at Massey’s Upper Big Branch mine , which killed “29 brave men” in the deadliest accident in American coal mining in four decades. Earlier on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton’s West Virginia state director, Talley Sergent, said Mr. Blankenship had demonstrated “blatant disregard for our miners and their safety.” In a statement Tuesday, Mr. Blankenship said Mrs. Clinton “should understand that as a lifetime member of coal country and a proud West Virginian, I am interested\\xa0in any suggestions she has to address\\xa0the problems coal\\xa0miners and coal communities\\xa0face today.” But, he added, “it is disappointing that she is choosing\\xa0to promote her political campaign by demonizing me.” Mr. Blankenship, a Republican donor who rose from a working-class childhood in Appalachia to lead the nation’s sixth-largest coal company, continues to have deep ties in West Virginia, which holds its Democratic primary on May 10. In April, a Federal District Court sentenced Mr. Blankenship for his connection to the Upper Big Branch explosion. He was not accused of directly causing the incident and has emerged as a lightning rod in a legal case that the news media called “ The People v. the Coal Baron .” Mr. Blankenship’s verdict was the first time such a high-ranking energy executive was convicted of involvement in a mining safety violation. Mrs. Clinton endured a hostile greeting when she campaigned Monday in Mingo County, a center of white working-class voters drawn to Mr. Trump’s brand of populism. Her two-day bus tour of Appalachia turned into an apology tour of sorts for comments she made in March to CNN that if elected, she would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” Republicans skewered Mrs. Clinton for the remark, made in the context of creating new clean energy jobs in depressed parts of the country, and she spent much of her time here explaining the remark and laying out her plan to help coal country. “To put it plainly, I misspoke,” Mrs. Clinton said at the final event of her two-day Appalachia tour on Tuesday. “One reason I took this trip is to say it directly to the people it affected.” \\n',\n",
       " 'Follow our live coverage of  N.F.L. scores  here. Chaos continued to reign in Week 6, with a few major upsets, a few huge injuries, and the Jets very nearly finding a way to beat the Patriots. Here is what happened: ■ The N.F.L. is running out of stars. Last week J. J. Watt and Odell Beckham Jr. sustained season-ending injuries. This week claimed Green Bay Packers quarterback  Aaron Rodgers , who is probably out for at least the regular season. Rodgers was driven into the turf at the end of a play against the Minnesota Vikings and left the field with a broken right collarbone. The Packers claim to be confident in  Brett Hundley  at quarterback, but he played poorly in relief of Rodgers. ■ Super Bowl hangovers are no fun. The  Atlanta Falcons  came out of their bye week hoping that the time off would erase the bad memories of a Week 4 loss to Buffalo. A 17-0 lead over the Miami Dolphins at halftime had things moving in the right direction, but a second-half collapse — a difficult subject for Atlanta fans after last season’s Super Bowl — resulted in a shocking 20-17 defeat. It was almost enough to make Jay Cutler seem happy. Almost. ■ Not every break can go the  Kansas City Chiefs ’  way. During their 5-0 start to the season, they continually got huge fourth-quarter defensive plays to seal their wins. On Sunday, they nearly picked off a Ben Roethlisberger pass, which would have gone a long way to securing a come-from-behind victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. But the tipped ball ended up in the hands of Steelers receiver Antonio Brown, who raced into the end zone for a game-icing 51-yard touchdown. ■ A change of scenery can be nice. Traded to the  Arizona Cardinals  last week after not proving to be a fit in New Orleans, the 32-year-old  Adrian Peterson  turned the clock way back with a vintage 26-carry, 134-yard, two-touchdown performance, helping Arizona hold on for a 38-33 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The 37-year-old Carson Palmer got in on the fun with three touchdown passes, and the 34-year-old Larry Fitzgerald had 134 receiving yards. ■ The  Saints  can win with … defense? New Orleans has spent the Drew Brees era scoring a ton of points but negating most of that with poor play by the defense. On Sunday, the defense managed to score 21 of the team’s points via two interceptions returned for touchdowns and a fumble return for a touchdown in a hectic 52-38 victory over the Detroit Lions. Before anyone starts comparing them to the 2001 Baltimore Ravens, the Saints did allow the Lions to race back from a 45-10 deficit to get within 45-38 late in the game. Here’s a look at all the action on the field and in the training room on Sunday: On the first-quarter play in which Rodgers was injured, he rolled out to his right, and released the ball just before Anthony Barr drove him into the ground. Rodgers reacted angrily to the late hit, but no penalty was called, and after a short evaluation in the team’s medical tent, he was taken off the field on the back of an injury cart. The Packers (4-2) announced just after halftime that Rodgers’s right collarbone had been broken, and they left open the possibility that the injury could be season-ending. Rodgers broke his collarbone during the 2013 season and missed seven games. With Rodgers out, and Sam Bradford ruled out before the game for the Vikings, Sunday’s rivalry matchup turned into a battle of backup quarterbacks between Minnesota’s Case Keenum and Green Bay’s Brett Hundley. Keenum was better and got a great deal of help from Jerick McKinnon, propelling the Vikings to a 23-10 victory. Hundley, a third-year backup out of U.C.L.A., got off to a rocky start by throwing an interception on his first pass of the game. But his second pass was a 14-yard touchdown to Davante Adams, which briefly gave Green Bay a tie and some optimism. But Hundley never truly got going, completing 18 of 33 passes for 157 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions. Minnesota (4-2) hardly looked explosive, but thanks to solid work from McKinnon, three field goals from Kai Forbath, and a rash of Packers injuries, the Vikings were able to win fairly easily. McKinnon contributed a 27-yard touchdown catch and a 3-yard touchdown run as part of a game in which he had 99 yards from scrimmage. Keenum had 239 passing yards, 97 of which went to Adam Thielen, and Minnesota got two interceptions from its celebrated secondary. Beyond Rodgers, the Packers also lost several other key starters to injury, including David Bakhtiari (left tackle), Bryan Bulaga (right tackle), Lane Taylor (left guard) and Quinten Rollins (cornerback). In his postgame news conference, Packers Coach Mike McCarthy tried his best to not dwell on the injury to Rodgers. “Stating the obvious, the loss of Aaron Rodgers definitely hurts,” he said. “As a football team, we have to move forward.” McCarthy said he had confidence in Hundley, 24, as his starter going forward, with Joe Callahan as his backup. In his time at U.C.L.A., Hundley became the Bruins’ career leader in total offense and passing touchdowns, with 75. He also ran for 30 touchdowns. Doubts that he could handle being a pocket passer depressed his value, letting the Packers pick him in the fifth round of the 2015 draft. Rodgers was not the only starting quarterback sidelined Sunday. Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston sustained a right shoulder injury in the second quarter against Arizona and was replaced by Ryan Fitzpatrick for the rest of the game. With Aaron Rodgers out long term, the possibility remains that the Packers could seek help from a veteran free agent. One possibility: Colin Kaepernick, the former quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers who last season started a wave of sideline protests by kneeling during the playing of the national anthem. He grew up as a fan of the Packers. Kaepernick has filed a grievance against  the  N.F.L. , accusing all 32 teams of colluding to keep him out of the league. He opted out of his contract with the 49ers in March and has not found a team willing to sign him. His grievance will be heard by an arbitrator under the terms of the labor agreement between the union and the league. Kaepernick’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, said in a statement that Kaepernick had exhausted “every possible avenue with all N.F.L. teams and their executives.” KEN BELSON Read more about Kaepernick’s grievance here. The Giants came into Sunday night as enormous underdogs against the Denver Broncos, but in a winless season in which nothing has gone right for them, they had a night where they could do no wrong. The Giants rode their defense and a just-good-enough offense to a shocking 23-10 victory in Denver. In the first half, Broncos kicker Brandon McManus missed a 35-yard field goal; Trevor Siemian threw a pair of interceptions, the second of which was returned by the Giants’ Janoris Jenkins for a 41-yard touchdown; and the Giants built a 17-3 lead. The Giants (1-5) ended up forcing three turnovers, which helped offset the Broncos (3-2) outgaining them, 412 yards to 266. But even though the Giants’ offense did not produce much in the way of yardage, they produced a memorable effort, considering they came into the week missing their top three wide receivers because of injuries. Eli Manning turned Evan Engram into a formidable receiving option, with the rookie tight end catching five passes for 82 yards and one touchdown, which accounted for all but 46 of Manning’s passing yards. More surprising, the Giants managed 148 rushing yards against a Broncos defense that came into the game allowing an average of 50.8 yards a game on the ground. Orleans Darkwa accounted for nearly that on one 47-yard run, and finished the day with a career-high 117 yards. In an on-field interview after the game, Darkwa said he took his newfound success in stride. “When my number is called, that chip on my shoulder stays the same,” he said. “I’ve got to go out there and run hard.” BENJAMIN HOFFMAN The Kansas City Chiefs’ perfect start to the season came to a jarring halt in a 19-13 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Nothing went right offensively for the Chiefs. They got into an early 2-0 deficit when a snap sailed over quarterback Alex Smith’s head and through back of the end zone for a safety, and that proved to be an omen for how most of the game would go. Smith completed 19 of 33 passes for 246 yards while Kareem Hunt, the N.F.L.’s leading rusher, managed only 21 rushing yards. Except for a few solid drives late in the game, the Chiefs seemed almost comically incapable of moving the ball against Pittsburgh. A late 57-yard touchdown pass from Smith to De’Anthony Thomas in the fourth quarter got the Chiefs back into it, but they saw their luck run out as a tipped ball ended up in Antonio Brown’s hands and he sprinted for a 51-yard touchdown that put the game out of reach. That the Chiefs were in the game at all was a testament to how well their defense played because their offense was nonexistent for more than three quarters. The Chiefs did not get a first down until there were less than two minutes remaining in the first, half and Pittsburgh seemed to have an answer for Kansas City’s game-changing speed at every turn. Offensively, the Steelers (4-2) went back to their greatest hits by relying on Le’Veon Bell and Brown. It was the first time since Week 7 of 2015 that the Steelers stars each managed 100 or more yards rushing or receiving in the same game. Bell’s 184 yards on 32 carries were a big part of Pittsburgh controlling the clock for more than 36 minutes. It may not have translated to many points against the stingy Chiefs defense, but it was enough to get their team a victory. BENJAMIN HOFFMAN On their way toward what had the makings of another unwatchable season, toward securing a high draft pick and the prospect of selecting a franchise-changing quarterback, the Jets have resolved to think the unthinkable. Not only would they be competitive, but they would win a bunch, too — perhaps even against New England. The teams did, after all, enter Sunday with the same record (3-2) and tied, with Buffalo, atop the A.F.C. East. Against the Patriots, the Jets jumped to an early 14-0 lead and their hopes of an upset didn’t expire until there were 12 seconds remaining, when Josh McCown’s pass on fourth-and-16 from the New England 49 sailed incomplete. In the end, the Jets lost, 24-17, because they committed costly penalties and turnovers, and because the Patriots have Tom Brady and the Jets do not, and in part because of an overruled fourth-quarter touchdown that demanded a more sufficient explanation than they received and replays showed. Instead, Brady earned his 187th regular-season win of his career, breaking a tie with Peyton Manning and Brett Favre for the N.F.L. record. He threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns to Rob Gronkowski, one at the end of the first half to tie the score at 14-14 and the other at the beginning of the second half to give the Patriots a 21-14 lead. BEN SHPIGEL Read more about the Jets’ loss here. A touchdown pass from a running back, a kickoff return for a touchdown, an interception returned for a touchdown, a punt return for a touchdown, and a 53-yard run in overtime were all parts of the Chicago Bears’ wild 27-24 overtime victory against the host Baltimore Ravens. It was a 10-3 game in Chicago’s favor at halftime thanks to a fluttering 21-yard touchdown pass from the team’s backup running back, Tarik Cohen, to Zach Miller. The Bears (2-4) stretched their lead to 17-3 when Mitchell Trubisky hit Dion Sims for a 27-yard score, but that was when things got interesting, as Bobby Rainey of the Ravens returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. While neither team looked particularly sharp all game, Adrian Amos scored on an interception for the Bears, and the Ravens (3-3) were able to force overtime thanks to a 77-yard punt return touchdown from Michael Campanaro and a 2-point conversion. That was where Baltimore’s magic ran out. In overtime, the teams traded punts, and then Jordan Howard reeled off a 53-yard run that was the key to a 71-yard drive, setting up Connor Barth to win the game with a 40-yard field goal. The win will be credited as the first of Trubisky’s career. BENJAMIN HOFFMAN ■ Pharoh Cooper returned the opening kickoff 103 yards, one of two special teams touchdowns that helped the visiting Los Angeles Rams beat the Jacksonville Jaguars, 27-17. The Rams (4-2) also blocked a punt for a score and a 10-point lead in the first half. The Jaguars (3-3) botched a decent chance to tie the game early in the fourth period when Blake Bortles fumbled on one play and then threw an interception on the next. Leonard Fournette, the Jaguars’ rookie running back, had 130 yards, including a 75-yard run for his seventh touchdown of the season. (AP) ■ Deshaun Watson threw for 225 yards and three touchdowns, becoming the first rookie in N.F.L. history with at least three touchdown passes in three straight games, helping give the Houston Texans (3-3) a 33-17 victory over the Cleveland Browns. Watson has thrown 15 touchdown passes this season, the most in N.F.L. history by a rookie in a team’s first six games. Cleveland made yet another change at quarterback this week, benching the rookie DeShone Kizer for Kevin Hogan to make his first N.F.L. start. The Browns (0-6) lost their 16th in a row on the road. (AP) ■ Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins threw for two touchdowns, ran for a score, and also had an interception as part of an inconsistent performance against his former mentor Kyle Shanahan’s winless San Francisco 49ers in a 26-24 victory. The Redskins (3-2) blew a 17-point lead before barely holding on. The visiting 49ers (0-6) remain unsettled at quarterback: Shanahan benched Brian Hoyer for the rookie C.J. Beathard, who threw for 245 yards, a touchdown and an interception and nearly led an impressive comeback. With the 49ers down by 2 points in the final minute, Beathard led them toward field goal range. He was intercepted by Kendall Fuller on fourth down to seal the result. San Francisco has lost five consecutive games by 3 points or fewer. Shanahan said that Beathard did enough to earn the starting job for next week’s game against the Dallas Cowboys. (AP) ■ Nick Novak kicked a 32-yard field goal on the final play of the game and the Los Angeles Chargers took advantage of a key missed extra point by Giorgio Tavecchio to beat the Oakland Raiders, 17-16. The Chargers (2-4) had been done in by poor kicks this season, losing twice on misses by the former kicker Younghoe Koo. The host Raiders (2-4) lost their fourth game in a row. Oakland quarterback Derek Carr, who missed last week’s game with a broken bone in his back, threw for just 171 yards with two interceptions and a touchdown. (AP) The controversy over players demonstrating or protesting during the national anthem had largely died down, but it was reignited last week when  Vice President Mike Pence walked out  of the Indianapolis Colts’ game because of kneeling players on the San Francisco 49ers’ sideline. And on Sunday, several teams had players kneeling. During the week, Commissioner Roger Goodell  encouraged owners  to have their players stand. An  open letter  from Russell Okung of the Los Angeles Chargers on Friday attempted to organize a resistance among players. Teams like the Green Bay Packers continued to lock arms, while a few players for the San Francisco 49ers knelt during the anthem. Three members of the Miami Dolphins stayed off the field during the song, and the New Orleans Saints knelt before the anthem but were standing once it started. Okung raised his fist during the anthem of the Chargers’ game against the Oakland Raiders, after which the anthem singer, Jessica Sanchez, knelt. Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch sat during the anthem. Fans at home would be hard-pressed to know much more, as the networks have avoided showing the playing of the anthem. On Saturday, in  an act of solidarity with N.F.L. players , Hertha Berlin of the Bundesliga in Germany knelt before its home game. The starters linked arms and took a knee on the soccer field, while the coaching staff, club officials and substitutes took a knee off it. BENJAMIN HOFFMAN',\n",
       " 'EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Ben McAdoo is staying as coach of the Giants, at least until the end of the season. The Giants’ co-owners, John Mara and Steve Tisch, issued a statement Monday saying they were frustrated and disappointed with the Giants’ 1-8 record, but would not evaluate the team or make any moves until the end of the season. McAdoo’s future has been a major topic the past two weeks in the wake of a 34-point home loss to the Los Angeles Rams a little more than a week ago, then an embarrassing loss to a San Francisco 49ers team that was winless until Sunday. The owners said McAdoo, 40, who led the Giants to their first playoff berth since 2011 in his first season last year, had their support. The team has not fired a coach in the middle of the season since 1976. “We are in the midst of an extremely disappointing season,” the owners said in the statement. “Our performance this year, particularly the past two weeks, is inexcusable and frustrating. While we appreciate that our fans are unhappy with what has occurred, nobody is more upset than we are. “Our plan is to do what we have always done, which is to not offer a running commentary on the season,” the statement continued. “It is our responsibility to determine the reasons for our poor performance and at the end of the year, we will evaluate the 2017 season in its entirety and make a determination on how we move forward.” McAdoo was not sure how things would change with the owners’ statement, a move seemingly made to stop weekly speculation. “We’ll have to see how everybody responds,” McAdoo said late Monday afternoon. “Again, my focus is as it always is, on the week of preparation, to try to put a good plan together, help these coaches and players any way I can putting a good product on the field, and finding a way to get better.” The Giants have not done that much this season, and the product had been very ugly the past two weeks. MetLife Stadium was more than half empty in the second half of the 51-17 loss to the Rams, and Sunday’s loss had to be rock bottom. “I am disappointed, but I am determined to find a way to get it fixed,” McAdoo said “That’s where my focus is. No one expected our record to be what it is at this point, or us to be playing the type of football we are playing at this point. But we are, and we are what our record says we are, and the film reflects it. We need to find a way to improve.” The situation got even tougher for McAdoo last week when two anonymous players were quoted by ESPN as saying that he had lost the team, that some players had quit, and that players were angry about an inordinate amount of fines. McAdoo also caught some flak for suspending cornerbacks Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie in the last month for violations of team rules. They are both popular with teammates. McAdoo replaced Tom Coughlin as head coach last year and led the Giants to an 11-5 record. They were blown out by the Green Bay Packers in the wild-card playoff game. Much was expected this season with a good defense almost entirely returning and the offense bolstered by the signing of the free-agent receiver Brandon Marshall and the addition of tight end Evan Engram, the first-round draft pick. General Manager Jerry Reese made a calculated risk to keep a weak offensive line together in hopes that the blockers would blossom. Almost everything went wrong. Marshall was a bust, then he and Odell Beckham Jr. sustained season-ending ankle injuries against the Chargers on Oct. 8 in the team’s fifth straight loss. The line has been horrible and banged-up for most of the season. While the defense has played well at times, it has failed to hold fourth-quarter leads early in the season and given up way too many big plays lately.',\n",
       " 'If there is one N.F.L. team worthy of being compared to an unmitigated trash fire, it’s hard to argue against the Giants. Their transgressions have been well documented,  and if you built your fantasy football team around players who were thought to be key fantasy football contributors heading into the season — Odell Beckham Jr., Brandon Marshall and Paul Perkins, to name a few — you know better than most. No matter how dysfunctional an N.F.L. team is, there’s potential for fantasy value on any team in any given matchup. But when it comes to the Giants, there’s very little there. Eli Manning is set to return at starting quarterback  against the Dallas Cowboys, a development with little fantasy relevance other than making the Giants’ receiving options slightly more attractive (though Geno Smith would disagree). Sterling Shepard, the last Giants starting receiver standing, still finds himself on this week’s injury report, with a hamstring injury. If he is unable to play Sunday, that leaves only the rookie tight end Evan Engram as a startable fantasy option for Big Blue. The Cowboys, despite their recent offensive ineptitude, provide some intriguing possibilities for those in the fantasy football playoffs. Dak Prescott (DAL at Giants) —   He figured out how to throw touchdown passes again last weekend, with two against the Redskins despite injuring his throwing hand. The bruised right hand does not appear to be a problem,  after Prescott practiced with no issues on Wednesday.  Because of the Cowboys’ offensive struggles in the past month, Prescott has fallen off many fantasy radars heading into the playoffs. But there were encouraging signs last weekend regarding his chemistry with Dez Bryant and the running game, which finally got on track post-Ezekiel Elliott behind Alfred Morris. Don’t be surprised if Prescott puts up a big week against the Giants, who have given up the  third most fantasy points per game this season (18.9). Alex Smith (KC vs. Raiders) —   After four consecutive disappointing fantasy performances, Smith roared back with one of the most impressive quarterback outings of the season, totaling 37.6 standard fantasy points (366 yards, four touchdowns). It’s difficult to trust him completely given how the Chiefs have played in the second half, but it’s tough not to like him against the Raiders, a team he scored 25 points against in Week 7. With the division title still a possibility despite four losses in a row, expect the Chiefs, led by Smith and receiver Tyreek Hill, to throw everything they have against the Raiders. These two teams put up a total of 61 points when they faced off in Week 7, and Vegas likes this game as  the second highest scoring matchup this weekend (47.5).  Also consider: Marcus Mariota (TEN at Cardinals) LeSean McCoy (BUF vs. Colts) —  If you’ve stuck with McCoy through  the ups and downs this season,  you should be rewarded this weekend with this matchup against the Colts, who have allowed 12 touchdowns to opposing backs in 12 games, and the fifth most F.P.P.G. (20.2). McCoy, who is fifth among all backs in touches this season, has topped 20 fantasy points in three of the last seven games. My money’s on him making it four of eight. Lamar Miller (HOU vs. 49ers) —  His high volume of usage — tied for second among backs in snap count, 53.5 per game, and seventh in total carries — should translate into another solid fantasy performance, with potential for much more against the 49ers. He has averaged nearly 12 fantasy points per game over the last three weeks, and San Francisco has yielded the third most F.P.P.G. (21.3) this season. Also consider: Samaje Perine (WAS at Chargers) Marvin Jones (DET at Buccaneers) —  The Packers’ offense did something remarkable last Sunday: It failed to exploit the Buccaneers’ pass defense, which is the second worst in the N.F.L. based on passing yards per game (267.3). In fantasyland, it is the absolute worst, at 26.8 F.P.P.G. It’s safe to say that would not have been the case if Aaron Rodgers had been behind center. Assuming Matthew Stafford’s hand is in decent shape, the Lions should have a field day on offense, led by Stafford and Jones, who is second in the N.F.L. in touchdowns (eight) among receivers. Jones has 85 yards receiving or a touchdown, or both, in six of his last seven games. Michael Crabtree (OAK at Chiefs) —  He will be back on the field after serving a one-game suspension. Whether his teammate Amari Cooper will be is very much up in the air, as he is still dealing with an ankle injury after clearing the N.F.L.’s concussion protocol. Regardless, Cooper will not be 100 percent, if he does play, in this crucial division matchup, meaning Crabtree should be the No. 1 target for quarterback Derek Carr. Bolstering the case for Crabtree is the fact that the only Chiefs defensive back worth fearing, Marcus Peters, who shadowed Crabtree in their earlier matchup this season, is suspended for this game. On the whole, the Chiefs allow the second most F.P.P.G. to receivers (26.3). Also consider: Josh Gordon (CLE vs. Packers) Austin Seferian-Jenkins (NYJ at Broncos) —  He has underwhelmed over the last two games but is in a great spot this weekend against the Broncos, who have been exploited by opposing tight ends for 68.4 yards per game and the second most F.P.P.G. (10.8). In addition, tight ends have found the end zone in eight of 12 games this season. Also consider: Cameron Brate (TB vs. Lions) NE at Dolphins; LAC vs. Redskins Justin Tucker (BAL at Steelers); Matt Prater (DET at Buccaneers).',\n",
       " 'CHARLESTON, W.Va. —  West Virginia, which has the nation\\'s highest rate of babies born dependent on drugs, will now offer Medicaid coverage to treat those babies. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has approved treatment services in the state for newborns enduring the torment of drug withdrawal, the state Department of Health and Human Resources said in a news release Tuesday. The statement said West Virginia becomes the first state to receive such approval. Cindy Beane, commissioner of the DHHR\\'s Bureau for Medical Services, said it will allow the treatment of the opioid crisis\\' \"most vulnerable, innocent victims.\" In October, first lady Melania Trump visited Lily\\'s Place, a drug recovery center for infants in Huntington. During the visit, Lily\\'s Place Executive Director Rebecca Crowder lamented the challenge of getting funding and insurance coverage to treat the infants. The first of its kind in the nation, the 12-room, nonprofit facility was opened in 2014 by a group of volunteers and health care workers. Its website says the facility provides care for about 100 infants each year. \"This issue has been a source of uncertainty for Lily\\'s Place, so we welcome this announcement,\" Crowder said in a statement issued through the office of Republican U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins of West Virginia. \"This designation will allow us to continue to offer compassionate care to newborns in need.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the rate of babies born dependent on drugs in West Virginia was 33.4 per 1,000 hospital births in 2013, the latest year available, compared with the national average of 5.8. West Virginia also had by far the highest rate of drug overdose deaths in 2016 at 52 per 100,000 residents, up from 41.5 in 2015. According to the CDC, signs of drug withdrawal in babies include fevers, tremors, seizures, excessive crying, poor weight gain and dehydration. Crowder said the hope is to enable more infant drug rehab centers to open nationwide. A bill introduced in Congress last year is aimed at helping such facilities overcome regulatory hurdles and receive Medicaid-service reimbursement.',\n",
       " 'DIETRICH, Idaho — Anonymous phone callers from distant area codes have unleashed tirades of invective on the residents of this tiny rural town. Strangers cruise its paved and dirt roads, seeming to drive through just for a look. And come fall, Dean Grissom’s 7- and 11-year-old grandchildren will be going to another school. “Their parents think the kids aren’t safe,” said Mr. Grissom, 57, who works for the Idaho Fish and Game agency. He said that sending the children to classes in Shoshone, eight miles away, was unnecessary in his view, but that he understood the parents’ fears. A town he loves has been damaged. There is a lot of debate here about what happened at the town’s only school on Oct. 23 after a football practice: an assault, a racist attack, bullying, a failure of supervision by school officials, or some combination. Hardly anyone disputes, though, that this town of 350 people has been shaken to the core. State and local prosecutors say that several white football players bullied and brutally assaulted a mentally disabled black teammate in a locker room that October day, shoving a coat hanger into his rectum while other boys held his arms. Two of the players accused in the attack were charged as adults with felony sexual assault and could face  life in prison  if convicted. A third teammate has been charged as a juvenile. A preliminary hearing on the criminal charges is scheduled for Friday. In addition, a $10 million federal civil suit was filed last month by the boy’s adoptive parents, Tim and Shelly McDaniel, who are white. In it, they accused the school district and its administrators, trustees, employees and volunteers of failing in their legal duty to protect the McDaniels’ son, who they say endured months of racist taunts, humiliation and physical abuse. After the locker-room attack, the boy required treatment at two hospitals for rectal injuries. “The school district and individual defendants acted with deliberate indifference to the harassment, humiliation, mental and physical abuse and mistreatment of the plaintiff by students of the district and thereby permitted and caused him to be bullied, beaten and raped,” the lawsuit said. In big ways and small, the repercussions of both the crime and the family’s response are already rippling out, no matter what happens in court or at the school, which has 245 students in grades K-12. Mr. McDaniel, 60, who has taught science at the school for 21 years, put the family’s house up for sale last month and is looking for work elsewhere. The cars and trucks that sometimes slowly cruise by out front, he said, and the funny looks he gets around town have unnerved him and his wife, who is 51. On July 1, a state law allowing Idahoans to carry a concealed weapon without a permit will take effect, and Mr. McDaniel said he planned to be armed after that. “If I could be gone today, I’d be gone,” he said, sitting outside in the yard on a recent afternoon as dogs wandered about near chicken and goat pens. The McDaniels stood out here in rural Idaho even before the locker-room episode. Over the years, they have adopted 20 children of various races — white, Hispanic and black — many of them with physical, mental or emotional troubles, including autism and fetal alcohol syndrome. A few years ago, Mr. McDaniel raised hackles by teaching sex education in his science classes with illustrations that some critics said were too graphic, and one of his daughters led  a campaign on Facebook  to save his job. The legal terrain to come is a minefield in itself, education law experts said. Courts have generally recognized that school officials cannot be everywhere all the time, and have not typically held teachers, administrators or coaches legally responsible for occasional bullying. But that deference can fade when race, religion or disability is involved, said John Dayton, a professor of education law at the University of Georgia. In those cases, courts have sometimes tilted hard the other way, he said, if they find that a clearly vulnerable group or category of students was not sufficiently protected. Other education experts said the central question raised by the McDaniels’ lawsuit — whether school officials should be held responsible for failing to stop a culture of bullying before it escalates to violence — had become harder to answer as new and different ways of bullying have proliferated. “The expectation of supervision has increased,” said Ann E. Blankenship, an assistant professor of educational leadership at the University of Southern Mississippi. Technology, she added, “opens the door to bullying opportunities 24 hours a day.” Don Heiken, Dietrich’s mayor, has publicly called on the school to fire people involved in the football program, who he said must have been aware that bullying, if not outright racism, was getting worse. The boy, according to his parents’ suit, was stripped of his pants on the bus after one football game, while other students took photos. He was “continuously” subjected, the suit said, to “wedgies” — his underwear yanked sharply upward, sometimes so violently that he came home with torn shorts. “They had to have known,” Mr. Heiken said in an interview. It probably did not help, Mr. McDaniel said, that in a school where sports are hugely important, his son was unskilled at football. Unable to remember the plays, the boy was called offsides — crossing the scrimmage line before the ball was snapped — six or seven times in a row in a single game, his father said. Dietrich itself, about 35 miles from Twin Falls and about 60 miles from the resort community of Sun Valley, is changing and growing, which has become part of the discussion about what happened here. The population has doubled in the last couple of decades and is expected to double again even faster, according to a planning presentation made recently to the town council. Lynn Johnson, 78, said “outsiders,” as he called the wave of newcomers, were changing the town where he has lived for the past 42 years, and not always for the better. Both of the students charged as adults in the case — Tanner Ray Ward, 17, and John R. K. Howard, 18 — were relatively new to the community, for example. The defendant being tried as a juvenile has not been named in court documents. “Neither of them boys are from Dietrich,” said Mr. Johnson, who drove a school bus and did maintenance work for the school for 17 years. “It wouldn’t have happened without them.” A lawyer for Mr. Ward declined to comment, and a lawyer for Mr. Howard did not respond to phone messages. The school superintendent and principal, both defendants in the civil suit, did not respond to emails and phone messages. Mr. Grissom, who lives just a few blocks from the school, said that he knew and admired the McDaniel family, and that he thought that admiration was shared in much of the town. That they would move away was one more piece of the damage, he said. “People look at this and say a lot of people are prejudiced here,” Mr. Grissom said. “They’re not.”',\n",
       " 'Good Wednesday. Here are some of the stories we are watching.  •  The former C.E.O. of Massey Energy plans to run for U.S. Senate. •  Where have all the media deals gone? •  Mars invests in Kind, a step toward a more healthful empire. • One of the biggest German IPOs in years could arrive next year. •  Cineworld holds talks to buy Regal. Want this in your own email inbox each morning?  Here’s the sign-up . Two senators —  Ron Johnson of Wisconsin  and Steve Daines of Montana — have argued the Republican tax plans give big corporations preferential treatment compared with pass-throughs. The problem with their argument is it’s wrong.  The New York Times’s Patricia Cohen reports : The key point here is that corporations and their investors are taxed twice: Pass-through businesses, meanwhile, are taxed just once: But even in Republican rewrite of the tax code — in which the corporate rate is lowered to 20 percent — pass-throughs still come out on top. That again is because corporation are taxed twice. Six months ago, Don Blankenship — the former C.E.O. of Massey Energy and once one of the most-feared men in the coal industry — shed his label as federal inmate 12393-088. Now Mr. Blankenship, who was convicted of crimes related to the explosion at the Massey-run Upper Big Branch mine in 2010 that killed 29 men, is pursuing a new career: senator. West Virginia’s WCHS  reported today that Mr. Blankenship had filed federal election papers to run in the Republican primary for United States Senator in West Virginia next year. The winner of Republican primary would face Democratic incumbent Senator Joe Manchin III in the 2018 election. One thing Mr. Blankenship won’t have a problem with is name recognition: He’s one of the best-known figures in West Virginia, both for his decade-long tenure as the C.E.O. of Massey and then for his downfall after the mine explosion. Our colleague David Segal noted the onetime mogul’s corporate achievements in  a 2015 profile : Mr. Blankenship was eventually convicted of having deliberately skirted federal mining safety requirements. It’s a charge he has consistently denied, and he has called himself an “American political prisoner.” But Massey was left low after the Upper Big Branch explosion, the worst American mining disaster in four decades. The company  sold itself to a rival , Alpha Natural Resources, in 2011 for $7.1 billion. Alpha in turn filed for bankruptcy in 2015, battered by a plunge in coal prices. The company’s future remains questionable despite having  emerged from Chapter 11 protection  last year. There’s no guarantee that Mr. Blankenship will square off against Mr. Manchin, who criticized Mr. Blankenship for his role in the explosion. Bloomberg notes that at least two other candidates  plan to run  for the Republican nomination. There has certainly been a lot of talk about media mergers in recent weeks. Disney ,  Verizon  and  Comcast  have all expressed interest in portions of 21st Century Fox. The Meredith Corporation  agreed to purchase  Time Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at nearly $3 billion. And hanging over all that is the antitrust fight over AT&T’s proposed $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner. But all this news may have obscured the fact that media deal making has slowed markedly this year. So far in 2017, the value of announced media deals in 2017 is down 69 percent in the United States from a year ago and 57 percent globally, according to Thomson Reuters. The total volume of these deals is at its lowest level since 2013 in the United States and 2012 worldwide. This slowdown is unlikely to reverse soon. The Trump administration’s  lawsuit to block AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner  has ignited a guessing game about what type of media deals could get done. As Andrew and Michael wrote last week : So until there is a conclusion to the AT&T-Time Warner deal, big media acquisitions are likely on hold. As some consumers move away from sugary sweets like M & Ms and Snickers, Mars is  buying a minority stake  in a maker of snack bars that uses ingredients like quinoa and amaranth. Mars’s investment in Kind gives the smaller company a valuation of more than $4 billion — five times its value three years ago. Their shared goals: Expand Kind from being a snack maker into a health-food empire, and expand its international sales. “Job No. 1 is taking it global. Job No. 2 is, what other categories either are we already in, or we can easily get into, that meet the Kind promise?” Grant F. Reid, the Mars chief executive, told Andrew in an interview. The numbers:  Kind’s 2017 sales thus far are close to $720 million, according to Euromonitor. It’s the third-biggest snack-bar brand worldwide, behind Nature Valley and Clif Bar. The back story:  Kind’s founder, Daniel Lubetzky, had been considering selling a minority stake — but was interested primarily in staying private. Mars, one of the biggest privately held American corporations, had long been interested in striking up a partnership. And, given its deal-making history, Mars could end up owning Kind outright down the road. ____________________________ Today’s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. ____________________________ Siemens said on Wednesday that  it plans to list its medical technology solutions business  in Frankfurt in the first half of 2018 in what is expected to be one of the biggest German initial public offerings in years. The Healthineers unit is among Siemens’ most profitable businesses, generating 13.8 billion euros, or about $16 billion, in revenue in the company’s 2017 fiscal year, which ended in September. The Healthineers business supplies technology to the health care industry, including diagnostic imaging and laboratory diagnostics. Siemans did not disclose the size of the listing or the potential price range but is expected to sell a minority stake of up to 25 percent in the business. Some analysts have estimated that the listing could value the unit at up to €40 billion. Siemens first announced plans to list a minority stake in the business last year. Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are acting as global coordinators on the listing. The British cinema owner Cineworld confirmed on Wednesday that it was in advanced discussions to potentially acquire Regal Entertainment Group for about $3.1 billion. If the deal were to be completed, the two largest movie theater chains in the United States would be owned by overseas companies. AMC Entertainment is owned by the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda. The confirmation came after Regal said on Tuesday night that it was in discussions with Cineworld about an all-cash transaction to acquire Regal for $23 a share. Shares of Regal are up nearly 5 percent to $20.59 in recent trading. Regal’s stock has come under pressure this year because of a poor run for box-office movies but also the threat from Netflix, Amazon and other digital streaming companies. That threat is only going to get bigger.  Breakingviews columnist Liam Proud writes : The Justice Department  has argued  in its lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion Time Warner deal that putting together AT&T, which owns DirecTV and provides broadband internet service, and Time Warner, which owns HBO and Turner channels like TNT and CNN, puts too much power in one corporation. But  AT&T said  in a court filing  that it is battling tech giants with plenty of negotiating leverage. Google’s YouTube, for instance, began life without any Time Warner networks, suggesting — to AT&T, at least — that channels like TNT, CNN and TBS were inessential. Another key part of AT&T’s filing To show that it would not abuse any increase in power that buying Time Warner would afford, AT&T said that it had offered rival distributors the same sort of deal that the government allowed in the last big vertical media merger, Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal. That includes: • Letting rival video providers make use of arbitration in any dispute involving Turner’s channels. • Preventing Turner from shutting down its service, or “going dark,” in the case of any dispute. Recode points out that the concession is  a big deal . The AT&T flyaround • Days before the government’s lawsuit, AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, met with the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, to offer one last peace proposal. ( Bloomberg ) • Mr. Stephenson will speak at the Economic Club of New York today at noon, and his talk will be livestreamed. ( Economic Club of N.Y. ) A tax overhaul proposal emerged from the Senate Budget Committee after two notable Republican dissidents, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Bob Corker of Tennessee, said their concerns were resolved. Mr. Corker, who objected to how much the plan would add to the national deficit, said that details of a provision, that would reverse tax cuts if economic growth fell short of expectations, would be released tomorrow, according to  Politico . But such a provision worries Republican colleagues like John Kennedy of Louisiana, who  told the NYT , “I’m just not too excited about this idea of automatically tying our hands.” The Washington flyaround • President Trump is fighting with Democratic leaders as the government prepares for a potential shutdown when its funding expires on Dec. 8. ( NYT ) • The White House is finding rare common ground with Democratic lawmakers like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio on issues like free trade. ( WSJ ) The gross settlement is about 100 billion euros, or $119 billion, though Britain plans to say that it will ultimately pay about half of that when all is said and done.  The Telegraph says  that the exact amount will be calculated when Brexit is finalized. From reporting by Alex Barker and George Parker of  the FT : What still needs to be resolved :  Two other big issues need to be worked out before Prime Minister Theresa May presents the offer next week. What authority will the European Court of Justice have over the 3.2 million European citizens now living in Britain? And what kind of border will Northern Ireland have with Ireland, its southern neighbor? Reports of progress pushed up the value of the British pound this morning to about $1.34. The opposition to the F.C.C.’s plans to repeal the Obama-era regulations has included more than 200,000 phone calls placed to Congress and about 500,000 comments on the F.C.C.’s website. “There doesn’t seem to be middle ground on this issue,” John Beahn, a lawyer at Skadden Arps who specializes in regulation, told  the NYT . Ajit Pai criticizes Twitter:  The F.C.C. chairman  attacked the social network  for harshly regulating conservatives’s accounts, apparently referring to its new policy of suspending and de-verifying some white nationalists and far-right users, according to the WaPo. Critics’ corner, F.C.C. edition • Farhad Manjoo writes, “The internet doesn’t have to be a corporate playground. That’s just the path we’ve chosen.” ( NYT ) • Ben Thompson writes, “To believe that Chairman Pai is right is not to be against net neutrality; rather, it is to believe that the FCC’s 2015 approach was mistaken.” ( Stratechery ) Xavier Rolet is leaving , weeks after TCI Fund Management, a big investor in the stock exchange, warned that he was being forced out. His departure comes months after regulators had blocked the market operator’s plans to merge with Deutsche Börse. But TCI is also getting something that it had wanted, sort of: Donald Brydon, the L.S.E. chairman whom the fund wanted replaced, said that he would step down in 2019. But it’s bound to get messier. While a federal judge has denied an emergency request by the agency’s deputy director, Leandra English, to stop Mick Mulvaney from taking over as acting director, her lawsuit is likely to proceed. While Mr. Mulvaney sits in the director’s seat, however, he can do a lot to hobble an agency that he has derided as a “sad, sick joke.” He has issued a 30-day freeze on issuing any new rules or regulations. And experts say that he can abandon investigations or shrink the bureau’s budget, according to  the WaPo How else to describe the decision by the judge overseeing the company’s court battle with Alphabet’s self-driving car unit to delay the trial? He did so after discovering that Uber had not produced a letter that he said was potentially relevant evidence. Here’s what Judge William Alsup said, according to Cade Metz of  the NYT : What was in said letter:  Assertions by a former Uber employee to the ride-hailing giant’s deputy general counsel that the company had an internal team that was responsible for efforts “to evade, impede, obstruct, influence several ongoing lawsuits against Uber.” And it used anonymous servers and apps with self-destructing messages to avoid creating paper trails. An Uber spokeswoman said that nothing in the letter affected the merits of the lawsuit. The Uber flyaround • Uber lost $1.46 billion in its third quarter this year, according to unidentified people. ( Bloomberg ) • Benchmark and Menlo Ventures have said that they plan to sell some of their holdings as part of SoftBank’s tender offer for Uber shares. ( Reuters ) • JPMorgan Chase has hired  Sunghman Seo , formerly a senior executive at Deutsche Bank, as the head of its payments and business transformation unit for Europe, the Middle East and Asia. ( FT ) • Anthony Scaramucci decided to step down from the advisory board of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy after several weeks of conflict with students: “It’s a school of law and diplomacy.

       " 'Good Thursday. Here are some stories we are watching: •  Aspen Institute has a new leader. • The Bitcoin rocket has wobbled. Is a crash coming? • T. Boone Pickens begins to step back from public life. Want this in your own email inbox each morning?  Here’s the sign-up . Blue Apron co-founder Matt Salzberg  is stepping down  as chief executive and being replaced with Chief Financial Officer Brad Dickerson. Mr. Salzberg will become executive chairman, Blue Apron said. Shares of Blue Apron have struggled since it went public in June. The company priced its initial public offering at $10, 40 percent below its target. Since then, the stock has tumbled 70 percent to $2.99. Blue Apron has faced increased competition from Amazon and rival meal-kit delivery start-ups. Amazon’s announcement on June 16 that it would purchase Whole Foods Market weighed heavily on the offering. Since then, the company has done little to assuage investors. It has reported losing customers for two straight quarters and has laid off hundreds of employees. The Dow Jones Industrial Average smashed through 24,000 on Thursday. Increased optimism that the Senate will pass the Republican tax bill pushed the index up more than 300 points to close at 24,273 today. The rally extends a record run for the blue-chip index this year. The Dow has gained 21 percent this year. Here is a quick look at the run: •The Dow has crossed five millennial markers this year, the most on record. • It took the Dow just 30 days to go from 23000 to 24000, the third fastest 1,000 point move in history. • 3M  drove the index’s rally over the past 30 days , contributing more that 170 points. • The Dow has had 63 record closes this year. • the index is up 271 percent since March 9, 2009, the bear market low. One key point on taxes and  Thursday ’s rally:  Lower corporate taxes might not bolster the earnings of S&P 500 companies that much. “The effective tax rate among S&P 500 companies is already 26 percent. A 20 percent corporate tax rate would help, but it would not be as big a boon to large companies as it would be to small companies,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank,  told CNBC . A stated goal of the Republican tax overhaul was to prevent corporations from shifting profits to low-tax countries. Several academic economists, legal scholars and the Coalition for a Prosperous America argued Wednesday that the Republican plan speeding its way through Congress does not sufficiently address this issue. Daniel Alpert, founder of Westwood Capital and an adviser to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, writes that United States companies “will continue to face competition” from multinational corporations “that will continue to divert their taxable income to tax haven jurisdictions around the world.” In a letter to Congress, the group advocated for the adoption of sales factor apportionment: The Aspen Institute  named the president  of Franklin & Marshall College as its new leader on Thursday. Daniel R. Porterfield will succeed Walter Isaacson as the Washington think tank’s president and chief executive officer. Mr. Isaacson had run the Aspen Institute since 2003. He announced  his resignation in March . Mr. Porterfield has served as president of Franklin & Marshall since 2011. In an interview with the Washington Post,  Mr. Porterfield said : The Royal Bank of Scotland told staff on Thursday that it was formally closing its internal bad bank, an important milestone as Chief Executive Ross McEwan works to turn around the British bank. Since the division was started in 2008, the bank, based in Edinburgh, has exited 22 countries, cut its risk-weighted assets by more than half and shrunk its assets to 752 billion, or about $1 trillion. The bank held as much as £2.2 trillion in assets. Closing the Capital Resolution unit is an important moment, but the bank’s turnaround is far from finished. R.B.S. has not reported an annual profit in nine years. It is not expected to report an annual profit until 2018 despite reporting a profit in the first half of this year. The bank passed a stress test by the Bank of England this year that measured the ability of lenders to weather another financial crisis, but remained among the weakest of the biggest British banks. (It was forced to bolster its capital last year after failing the regulatory test.) R.B.S. also remains 72 percent owned by the British government following a bailout during the financial crisis. The government said this month that it plans to resume sales of its holdings by 2019 and hopes to sell some £15 billion of its stake by 2022. That process will be helped if R.B.S. can continue to improve its profitability and its capital position. A return to paying a dividend next year also would be a welcome sign for shareholders. Even non-fanatics are getting in on the action.  The WSJ found  a 70-year-old grandmother, Rita Scott, who reaped what her grandson said was a 45 percent gain on her investment. From the WSJ: Supporters say that there’s still plenty of room left for the digital currency to run, after technical glitches at some exchanges led to  a 20 percent decline  — and swift recovery — yesterday. But it highlights the mania over an asset whose price has climbed 69 percent in the past months. Bloomberg outlines  what could cut off  Bitcoin’s ascent, from regulation to hackers to short-sellers. Steven Mnuchin and other White House officials have argued that the Republican tax overhaul plans would pay for themselves through higher economic growth. And there were studies to prove that, even as critics say that tax cuts wouldn’t have such an effect. Turns out, the Treasury Department  doesn’t have the kind of analysis  that Mr. Mnuchin has promised. From our colleague Alan Rappeport: Instead, Treasury staffers have done smaller analyses of individual provisions. — Michael J. de la Merced Starting with putting his 65,000-acre Mesa Vista Ranch in Texas up for sale, with a price tag of $250 million. From  a LinkedIn post  announcing the sale: It’s acknowledgment by the 89-year-old Mr. Pickens that he is in his twilight years, after having built a fortune as an oil magnate and then a financier who rose to fame during the corporate raider period of the 1980s. Much of Mr. Pickens’s efforts in recent years have been focused on philanthropy. He has  signed the Giving Pledge , and he has donated money to his alma mater, Oklahoma State University, and other nonprofit and charitable causes. In selling the Mesa Vista Ranch, the mogul said that he wants to make sure that it ends up with a buyer who will carry on his conservation efforts. — Michael J. de la Merced The firing of Matt Lauer from NBC News for “inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace” marks one of the highest-profile dismissals yet in business for misconduct and abuse. It also highlights the potential financial impact of those violations. From Michael Grynbaum and John Koblin of  the NYT : And while “Today” trails ABC’s “Good Morning America” in total viewers, it still leads in the coveted 25-to-54 advertising demographic. Both  the NYT  and  Variety  reported on some of the accusations that Mr. Lauer faced. Mr. Lauer is the latest star to be thrown out of a  prominent media perch , following Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose, Mark Halperin, and an ever-growing list of others. His firing wasn’t even the only one to be announced yesterday:  Garrison Keillor  and a  senior CNN producer  were dismissed as well. Among those  who could replace  for Mr. Lauer are Megyn Kelly and CNBC’s Carl Quintanilla, according to the WSJ. And in tech:  Andy Rubin, who spearheaded the creation of Google’s Android operating system, has taken  a leave of absence  from his new start-up following the revelation that he had an inappropriate relationship with a female subordinate while at Google. The Information, which first reported the news, also took a look at  Google’s history  of interoffice relationships. The bigger picture Tara Lachapelle of Gadfly  writes: A senior financial executive phoned Michael last night to complain about how the Senate tax plan would endanger the private equity industry because it limits the deductibility of corporate debt interest payments — and applies that even to existing investments. The provision could completely upend the private equity business model, this person asserted. One example is Dell. A company executive explained to  the WSJ : But criticism of the Republican tax plan now appears focused on how much big business benefits  compared with average Americans  (even if that  isn’t necessarily the case ). For example, the NYT takes a look at the savings companies would enjoy from a lower tax rate from  repatriating foreign profits . It also isn’t clear that companies would spend their gains creating jobs. AT&T said that it could hire  7,000 new employees  if the overhaul were passed. But executives at Coca-Cola and Pfizer said that they would pass most of the money  onto their investors . The state of play The Senate could vote as soon as tomorrow on its tax plan. But there are plenty of unresolved matters: • The Senate may need to cut the corporate tax rate  a little less deeply , to 22 percent as opposed to 20 percent, to help raise much-needed federal revenue. Senators like  John Cornyn  of Texas aren’t in favor of that. • A proposed fail-safe that would prevent the tax change from expanding the national deficit too much — it would automatically roll back some tax cuts —  risks angering   Charles Grassley  of Iowa and  John Kennedy  of Louisiana. Bloomberg put the huge drop in the stock prices of “FANG” — that’s Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and what was once known as Google —  into perspective : What’s behind the drop? It could be as simple as investors believing that the huge run-up in tech stocks this year has reached its natural end, and that changes to tax policy would provide a lift to other industries. The tech and media flyaround • Facebook has temporarily disabled a tool that could let advertisers exclude some races from seeing ads. The company president, Sheryl Sandberg, told the Congressional Black Caucus that Facebook “is determined to do better” in preventing discriminatory advertising. ( Axios ) • Snapchat is redesigning its user interface, splitting content from users’ friends apart from that provided by media companies. ( NYT ,  Snap ) • BuzzFeed plans to lay off 100 employees, or about 6 percent of its global work force, as it tries to maintain revenue growth. Derek Thompson of The Atlantic writes about the challenges for digital-media companies. ( WSJ ,  Atlantic ) Speaking at the Economic Club of New York, Randall Stephenson of AT&T said that he had been one of Mr. Trump’s biggest defenders in the corporate world when it came to public policy. And then the Justice Department sued to block AT&T’s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. Mr. Stephenson described the lawsuit as “ a big curveball ,” according to Bloomberg. Who’s not buying CNN:  The Murdochs’ 21st Century Fox, at least according to co-executive chairman Lachlan Murdoch. “We wouldn’t be allowed to buy CNN and we  would never be interested  in buying CNN,” he said at Business Insider’s Ignition media conference, according to Reuters. The TV station  WCHS of West Virginia  reported that the former Massey Energy C.E.O. plans to run against Senator Joe Manchin next year. But how do West Virginians feel about the coal mogul who dominated their state’s business — and then went to prison for his role in the worst American mining disaster in decades? Mr. Blankenship turned Massey into a giant of the coal mining industry. But the company was laid low after the Upper Big Branch explosion. The miner  sold itself to a rival , Alpha Natural Resources, which later filed for bankruptcy. And Mr. Blankenship was eventually convicted of having deliberately skirted federal mining safety requirements. There’s no guarantee that Mr. Blankenship would get the Republication nomination for the Senate seat. The WSJ notes that he faces  two strong opponents  for the position. The company, which collects and analyzes data for industrial companies, got the money from a new investor, the British money manager Baillie Gifford, and the existing backers Revolution Growth and GreatPoint Ventures. Co-founded and led by Brad Keywell, a co-founder of Groupon, Uptake partners not with Silicon Valley darlings but with more traditional corporate names. Think Caterpillar and Berkshire Hathaway Energy. But the business is becoming more competitive, with  rivals like G.E.  making it a bigger priority. The start-up became a unicorn — that now-shopworn term for private start-ups valued at $1 billion or more — during  its last financing round . Interestingly, while Caterpillar had previously invested in the company, Uptake has since  bought back  the industrial equipment giant’s stake, in part to be able to work with other heavy equipment companies. — Judge William Alsup, who is presiding over a trade secrets lawsuit against Uber and who  upbraided the ride-hailing company  for not producing evidence that may be relevant to the case. • President Trump nominated Marvin Goodfriend, a leading critic of the Federal Reserve, to serve on the Fed’s board of governors.
