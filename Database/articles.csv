27 4 2017	https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/politics/joe-manchin-trump-hundred-days/index.html	Manchin charts own path in Trump-era West Virginia 	5	1	1	" Huntington, West Virginia (CNN) It was as if a light bulb went off over Sen. Joe Manchin's head. Manchin was touring a job fair hosted by his office last week and had just met the director of West Virginia's affiliate for Dress for Success, an organization that helps provide professional clothes for women. ""He's on 'Say Yes to the Dress,'"" Manchin repeated, still searching for the last name of the celebrity bridal consultant from the TLC reality show. It was the 17th job fair Manchin's office had hosted, this time in Huntington, West Virginia, a city with nearly 50,000 people on the western edge of the state. Manchin was already a well-known figure in West Virginia and on the national stage, but he has seen renewed attention under the first 100 days of President Donald Trump's administration. Though the senator -- who's had a long career in public service -- has high name recognition in the state and a brand as a centrist Democrat, he's still campaigning among an electorate that picked Trump over Hillary Clinton by a whopping 42 points. In fact,  Democrats in West Virginia outnumbered Republicans in last year's election -- 44% to 31%  -- but the state still yielded Trump one of his greatest victory margins over Clinton. ""If I was a constituent and I looked at me and I said 'Joe Manchin, he's changed to a Republican or changed to an independent. Aiming to be the 'honest broker' Instead, Manchin is building a case that he's a Democrat with Trump's ear and can be what he calls an ""honest broker"" between the White House and his own party. Manchin's relationship with the President -- as well as the senator's efforts to cozy up to conservative media outlets like Breitbart -- have generated buzz this year, and last week Manchin sounded open to a potential endorsement from Trump, though he said he hasn't spoken with the president about it. And while he said he's ""happy"" with Manchin as his senator and plans to vote for him next year, he said at the end of the day he's ""not sure"" he can trust him. Jarrett Peters, 78, said he's not registered with any party and voted for Trump last year. Marilyn Meade, a 63-year-old Democrat who also stressed that she votes ""for the person,"" preferred Bernie Sanders over Clinton in the primary, but said she likes Manchin's moderate spirit and stated that she'll be voting for him next year. It's that same congressman who's considering a challenge against Manchin next year, as is state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Also likely to come up is Manchin's 2013 proposal with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey to expand background checks on gun purchases, a position that drew sharp rebuke from gun rights activists, including the National Rifle Association. Also anticipated from his opposition are attacks involving his daughter, Heather Bresch,  over criticism that her company, Mylan, raised prices for the life-saving medicine EpiPen by nearly 500% last year in order to enrich her company And Republicans are sure to reiterate Manchin's loyalty to Clinton last year, even after she made the damaging comment in a CNN town hall that she was ""going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."" The only Democrat who had a higher ranking was Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who's also up for re-election next year in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump."	56	5
16 5 2014	https://www.cnn.com/2014/05/16/us/west-virginia-school-controversy/index.html	W. Virginia AG: Middle school concealed alleged sex assaults, protected suspects	5	1	1	" The case moved behind closed doors Friday at the Mingo County courthouse, where two school district officials and four faculty members made their first appearance in a courtroom for a hearing a week after the state's top lawyer accused them in a civil complaint of concealing alleged sexual abuse at a Mingo County middle school. Names of neither the boys nor the girls have been released, but the attorney general's court filing identifies the suspects as Juvenile 1 and Juvenile 2, and states they are both relatives of employees of the Mingo County school system. Attorney General Morrisey declined to be interviewed for this article, but West Virginia State Police Public Information Officer Lt. Mike Baylous explained that a civil injunction -- like the one requested by Morrisey in this case -- is an ""extreme"" court order that is made for the purpose of restraining the defendant -- or in this case, the defendants - from pursuing any conduct that amounts to harassment. Court filings cite repeated examples of school officials allegedly protecting the accused in the seventh-grade sexual assault allegations, and claim that ""a relative of (one of the boys) was directly involved in the handling and investigation into the allegations against (him), and involved in decisions relating to the discipline/punishment of the male juvenile offenders."" In one instance, for example, a school official ""'disciplined' (the boys) for the alleged abuse of a female student by denying them a break for ice cream during statewide testing,"" the attorney general's court filing said. Jason Long, the attorney representing the Mingo County Board of Education and the Mingo County school superintendent, released a statement that said ""the Mingo County Board of Education is committed to working with the attorney general's office to resolve this investigation in a timely manner."	19	7

Residents of nine counties -- including the one that is home to Charleston, West Virginia's capital and most populated city -- were urged last week not to use their tap water to do anything except flush their toilets. The Greater Cincinnati Water Works, which serves that Ohio city and parts of four counties in Ohio and Kentucky, will temporarily stop taking water from the Ohio River as a precaution, allowing water that might contain traces of the chemical to pass the city, company spokeswoman Michele Ralston said Tuesday."	23	5

Joe Manchin is heading into his re-election fight as a top target for Republicans, but to hear him tell it, he does not care about the pressure on his seat. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican challenging Manchin in the 2018 Senate race, issued a letter last week calling on Manchin to resign his position in Senate Democratic leadership, casting Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as far too liberal and at odds with the interests of West Virginia.	28	7
23 3 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/23/politics/trump-tweet-spending-bill-senate-republican-primaries/index.html	Trump's veto threat on spending bill gives ammo to conservative candidates in GOP primaries  	5	1	1	" Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's Friday tweet threatening to veto the $1.3 trillion spending bill has intensified a battle already being waged in key Republican Senate primaries over the measure. In three states -- Arizona, West Virginia and Indiana -- right-wing candidates had already staked out their opposition to the bill. But Trump's tweet has given them a new opening to cast their opponents -- all House members who voted for the bill -- as being on the wrong side of the Trump agenda. In West Virginia, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who along with former coal baron Don Blankenship is running against Rep. Evan Jenkins in a May Senate primary, said Trump should veto the bill. Congress & Evan Jenkins caved on the wall, paved the way for more gun control, and give money to Planned Parenthood. In Arizona, state Sen. Kelli Ward had already blasted Rep. Martha McSally for her vote, tweeting Thursday night: ""Want to know the difference between me and my opponent @RepMcSally? Try her vote today in favor of a $1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that doesn't include funding for a new #BorderWall but continues to fund #SanctuaryCities."" Friday morning, she retweeted Trump, thanking him and saying she was ""working hard so you have a conservative"" from Arizona to help his agenda. In Indiana, Rep. Todd Rokita -- who voted against the bill, calling it ""the Washington swamp at its worst"" -- retweeted Trump, signaling that he intended to use the issue against Rep. Luke Messer, a leading primary foe who voted for it. Later, he tweeted his criticism of the bill, saying it ""did not include the priorities"" of Trump and Hoosiers. In Ohio as well, Mike Gibbons, a Republican running in the Senate primary against Rep. Jim Renacci, is hitting Renacci on the spending bill -- even though Renacci voted against it. Gibbons' argument is that Renacci, as a House Budget Committee member, is responsible for the product. ""The budget bill that just passed spends money we don't have, fails to fund the wall, but does fund Planned Parenthood. Jim Renacci can't hide his failure and ineffectiveness behind a 'no' vote on the floor,"" Gibbons said. Gibbons on Friday morning retweeted Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who tweeted: ""I agree @realDonaldTrump should veto this sad excuse for legislation because it's $1.3 trillion in spending that (almost) no one read."""	9	7
3 1 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/politics/steve-bannon-senate-candidates-trump-feud/index.html	Some Bannon-backed Senate hopefuls begin distancing themselves amid Trump feud	5	1	1	" Washington (CNN) Several Republican candidates endorsed by Steve Bannon began distancing themselves from the former White House chief strategist Wednesday after President Donald Trump said Bannon had ""lost his mind."" In Arizona, a spokesman for Kelli Ward -- the conservative that hard-liner Bannon backed even as leading GOP strategists and Trump himself attempted to recruit someone else into the race to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake -- cast Bannon's endorsement as unimportant. Her focus remains on winning this race, which she is in a great position to do, and then helping President Trump advance an America First agenda,"" Ward press secretary Zachery Henry said. A spokeswoman for West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the Bannon-backed candidate who faces Rep. Evan Jenkins in the primary before a match-up with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, criticized Bannon's remarks about Trump's family. Attorney General Morrisey does not support these attacks on President Trump and his family, and was proud to stand with President Trump in 2016 when they were both overwhelmingly elected in West Virginia and when he cast his vote for Trump in the Electoral College,"" Morrisey spokeswoman Nachama Soloveichik said. They are baseless attacks against the President's family, beyond disturbing, and I fully support our Commander in Chief,"" Grimm said in a statement. In Nevada, Sen. Dean Heller's campaign seized on the Trump-Bannon feud to attack his primary opponent, the Bannon-backed Danny Tarkanian. ""Danny Tarkanian and Steve Bannon are frauds whose only skill is losing elections and costing Republicans seats,"" said Heller spokesman Keith Schipper. Tarkanian, meanwhile, was the only candidate to say directly Wednesday that he still wants Bannon's support. ""If Mr. Bannon chooses to support me in our effort to repeal and replace Dean Heller with someone who will truly have the President's back, I welcome his support,"" he said. In Mississippi, state Sen. Chris McDaniel is considering launching a primary challenge against Sen. Roger Wicker -- with Bannon's encouragement. Conservatives need to work together, not tear each other apart,"" he said in a text message when asked about the Trump-Bannon feud. In other Senate races, Bannon has endorsed Attorney General Josh Hawley in Missouri, state auditor Matt Rosendale in Montana, Rep. Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee and businessman Kevin Nicholson in Wisconsin."	14	6

Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke actually outraised Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2017's fourth quarter, hauling in $2.4 million to Cruz's $1.9 million.	72	4

The decision In Tuesday's ruling, the court was asked to mull the meaning of the word ""sex"" and if that includes ""sexual orientation."" Thirty years ago, the state Legislature defined a civil rights crime as a ""threat, intimidation and/or injury to another person or another person's property because of specifically enumerated characteristics, including the victim's 'sex,'"" the  decision states . In the war of words, the court ruled that what's in the Legislature's code stands: ""Based upon the common and plain meaning of the word 'sex,' as well as the Legislature's clear intent, we are left with the ineluctable conclusion that the word 'sex' does not include 'sexual orientation.'"" ""The facts of this case are deeply disturbing and heinous, and I remain steadfast in describing the alleged behavior as despicable, but such conduct does not give the judicial system a license to rewrite state law,"" Morrisey's office said in a statement. Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's president and CEO, said: ""At a time when anti-LGBTQ hate violence is on the rise, this ruling reiterates the need to advocate for LGBTQ-inclusive hate-crime laws in all states across the nation."" While Workman agrees that the statute does not include the ""two magic words"" sexual orientation, she said ""this court adopted an overly narrow focus, metaphorically missing the forest for the trees."""	40	1

But the panelists sitting alongside Trump at the roundtable event -- a medley of local business executives, employees and regular families -- accomplished the White House's goals, sharing personal stories of tax savings, bonuses and raises they attributed to the GOP tax law. Previewing the event, a senior White House official told CNN that Trump would focus on the tax reform proposals, which Republicans hope to make central to their efforts to hold onto their majorities in Congress. Ultimately, Trump called Manchin out several times -- first over the tax reform bill, then over his opposition to an Obamacare repeal bill and even over ""other things we don't like."" Trump's remarks at a roundtable touting his tax reform law came as he sat in between two of Manchin's would-be Republican opponents for the 2018 Senate election, GOP Rep. Evan Jenkins and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Similar to an Ohio event last week, the roundtable was billed as an official White House event -- not a campaign event -- but Trump spent most of his time talking about electoral politics and repeatedly railed against Manchin, a Democrat who has supported some of the President's initiatives -- though not the biggest-ticket items. Key to those efforts will be the roundtable-style events like the one Trump is holding in West Virginia, the senior White House official said, as Republicans look to focus their campaign messaging on the economic benefits of the tax law."	81	6

Remember: The current balance of power in the Senate is 51 Republicans, 49 Democrats (and independents who caucus with them). Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller Primary date: June 12 Heller tops this list for two reasons: He's the only Republican up for re-election in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and unlike the split fields we see in other states, he has dangerous one-on-one matchups in both the primary (against Danny Tarkanian) and the general election (against Rep. Jacky Rosen). Arizona Incumbent: Open seat (Republican Sen.

Joe Donnelly Primary date: May 8 In the three-way Republican primary between Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and former state Rep. Mike Braun, it's Rokita who wields the sharpest knife. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Primary date: June 12 Republicans got good news when Rep. Kevin Cramer changed his mind and decided he'd run against Heitkamp after all. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Primary date: June 5 Last in a string of five straight Democratic-held seats in states Trump won by double digits, Tester is watching and waiting to see how the GOP primary develops.

Al Olszewski are also in the race. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen.

Manchin, who's in his first full term as a senator, faces a tough re-election battle in West Virginia next year, where Republicans feel confident they can pick up a Senate seat, given the state's support for Trump last year. Donnelly was the third Democrat to back Gorsuch, joining Manchin and Heitkamp, and he voted against six of Trump's major nominees.

Evan Jenkins announced Monday that he plans to challenge Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia, a seat that Republicans consider within their reach in next year's midterm elections. Jenkins, who represents the state's 3rd Congressional District, criticized Manchin in a  nearly three-minute announcement video , painting the incumbent senator as a Washington insider and knocking him for supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016. A former governor with deep ties to the state, Manchin has wide name recognition in West Virginia but faces re-election as a Democrat in a state that voted for President Donald Trump by 42 points over Clinton last November. Manchin charts own path in Trump-era West Virginia Jenkins, who previously served as a Democrat in the West Virginia Senate, was elected to the US House in 2014 as a Republican, defeating incumbent Democratic Rep.

As if to underscore that view, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker -- the Senate foreign relations committee chairman who is retiring rather than running for re-election in 2018 -- accused Trump  in a New York Times interview  of putting the nation on a path to World War III and said Trump's presidency ""would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation."" It isn't expected to be as aggressive in seeking to unseat Republican incumbents as Bannon has been, but the super PAC does intend to support Senate candidates who back Trump's agenda and call for the elimination of the Senate's 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster -- potentially including Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel, Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale, West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey and more. The key, the source familiar with Bannon's plans said, ""is to prove the theory of the case"" -- that Republicans who are anti-Trump should be gone."	8	6

ADVERTISEMENT The money will go to compensate the grieving families, bankroll cutting-edge safety improvements and pay for years of violations by Massey Energy, owner of the Upper Big Branch mine at the time of the April 2010 blast. Under the deal, Alpha Natural Resources -- which bought Massey earlier this year -- will face no criminal charges in the explosion as long as it abides by the settlement, U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said. The settlement consists of $46.5 million in restitution to the miners' families, $128 million for safety improvements, research and training, and $35 million in fines for safety violations at Upper Big Branch and other Massey mines. ""We're particularly pleased that a substantial portion of the settlement is going towards furthering miner safety, which has always been Alpha's guiding principle,"" he said. Under Tuesday's settlement, Virginia-based Alpha will invest $48 million in a mine-safety research trust and spend an additional $80 million to improve safety at all of its mines with the latest technology."	8	3
13 04 2010	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/04/13/bodies-recovered-west-virginia.html	Bodies of All 29 West Virginia Miners Recovered	1	2	1	 CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- The bodies of all 29 West Virginia coal miners killed in an explosion last week have been recovered from the mine, a spokeswoman for the state mine office said Tuesday. ADVERTISEMENT Jama Jarrett said the last bodies were taken out around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Tuesday and the bodies were being sent to the state medical examiner for autopsies. Recovery efforts had been stalled in previous days by volatile gases, but teams entered Monday after the tunnels were ventilated. The recovery of the remaining bodies, paves the way for federal investigators to enter the mine as they try to determine what caused the worst U.S. coal mining disaster since 1970. Investigators had not yet entered the mine early Tuesday, Jarrett said. The team of inspectors from the Mine Safety and Health Administration briefed Secretary of Labor   and MSHA director Joe Main at the Upper Big Branch mine Monday. The mine's owner, Richmond, Va.-based Massey Energy Co., has been under scrutiny for a string of safety violations at the mine, though CEO Don Blankenship has defended the company's record and disputed accusations that he puts profits ahead of safety. New York state's comptroller and a pension fund adviser called for Blankenship's resignation immediately as chairman of Massey's board. Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, trustee of a retirement fund holding more than 300,000 shares of Massey stock worth $14 million, said the company failed to adequately manage risks at the mine. A similar challenge came in a letter to Massey from William Patterson, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based CtW Investment Group, which works with union pension funds. Mourning continued Monday exactly a week after the explosion, with the ceremony at the state Capitol and a moment of silence at 3:30 p.m. President   ordered all U.S. flags in the state flown at half-staff until sunset Sunday. He restored $750,000 in funding for mine safety inspections in Virginia to the state's strained budget, saying the tragedy in West Virginia was a wakeup call.	96	6

If he heads to prison before an appellate decision, his defense attorneys say the decision may not come until after his whole sentence is served. Blankenship was convicted Dec. 3 of a misdemeanor conspiracy to willfully violate mine safety standards at Upper Big Branch Mine. The southern West Virginia coal mine exploded in 2010, killing 29 men.	30	3

In key calls, Blankenship said a scathing internal safety memo should be kept highly confidential, and that it would be a terrible document to show up in legal discovery if there was a mine fatality. Under defense cross-examination, Christopher Blanchard -- who ran the subsidiary that oversaw Upper Big Branch -- said Blankenship and Massey pushed for safety. Testifying to prosecutors, Blanchard said he believed Blankenship thought it was less expensive to pay fines than pay for measures to prevent safety violations.	21	1

One day after the sixth anniversary of the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion, which killed 29 men, U.S. District Judge Irene Berger gave the ex-Massey Energy CEO the maximum prison time and fine of $250,000. Blankenship spoke briefly during the sentencing hearing and said he wanted to reassure the families of the fallen miners that they were ""great guys, great coal miners."" As Blankenship left the courthouse, a few family members of miners who were killed started yelling at him while he and his attorneys spoke with reporters. Asked by a reporter what he had to say to the shouting family members, Blankenship said: ""Well, just that the coal miners didn't cause the accident."" Four other workers in the corporate chain were convicted of crimes including faking a foreman's license, lying to federal investigators and conspiring in an illegal scheme to warn miners and other subsidiaries of surprise safety inspections. The judge described Blankenship's rise from a meager, single-mother Appalachian household to one of the wealthiest, most influential figures in the region and in the coal industry. In 2011, Alpha Natural Resources, which bought Massey after the explosion, agreed to pay $210 million to compensate grieving families, bankroll cutting-edge safety improvements and pay for years of violations by Massey Energy. The judge already ruled that Blankenship won't have to pay $28 million in restitution to Alpha Natural Resources, helping him avoid a serious blow to his personal fortune. Berger also ruled that Blankenship would not have to pay restitution to about 100 people, including former miners and family members."	95	3

A majority of the samples came from areas affected by the explosion, but show only that coal dust played a role in the blast, Mine Safety and Health Administration official Kevin Stricklin said during a conference call with reporters. ""This is not the first time MSHA has attempted to use unproven or faulty coal dust claims in their investigation efforts,"" the Richmond, Va.-based company said in a statement. The logs, which Massey turned over to investigators, also show the mine routinely had to deal with excessive coal dust along the belts. MSHA has collected 1,803 dust samples so far and 79 percent contained too little inert material to comply with the law, Stricklin said. ""When the industry comes to grips with this issue and figures out a way to beef up their health and safety programs, there's going to be less enforcement action for MSHA to take,"" Main said."	79	3

Famed political prognosticator Charlie Cook sees Republicans holding as many as 248 seats, while his esteemed counterpart Stu Rothenberg projects the high mark for Republicans will be as many as 245. As results on the East Coast should be known early, here are three races to watch to gauge the potential for Republicans to reach 245 seats in the House by the end of the evening. With the retirement of Rep. Frank Wolf, Republicans must hold this sprawling Northern Virginia district, which he has represented since 1981. As evidenced by Republicans winning this congressional district by a mere 1 percent in last year’s gubernatorial election, it has become increasingly competitive. With her repeated elections to the state House, Comstock has shown an ability to win in the more challenging areas of the congressional district for Republicans. In a year favoring Republicans, this provides a welcome advantage for State Rep. Marilinda Garcia, who is challenging the Democratic incumbent, Rep. Ann Kuster. By winning these three races, the question throughout the night will increasingly become which Republican candidate’s victory expands the majority to 245 seats.	33	1

Nearby, a giant cart implores passersby “Please Do Not Remove.” Yet the cart’s contents are limited to a crushed Dunkin’ Donuts box and the carcass of an empty Doritos bag. Someone in Rayburn raided a copy of The Washington Post from the stash of papers deposited outside the office of Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif. Perhaps they actually just wanted the ads. Several “Micro Fridges” are stowed in the hall between the offices of Reps. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz., and Kathy Castor, D-Fla., in Longworth. Four floor lamps stand erect (sans shades), a coat tree and three couches without cushions are found in the hall by the office of Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas. “Contact Angeline, 1213.” Several office dividers feature tags reading “Paint all ceilings” and “Getting new paint.” A discarded map of Colorado lies against a wall nearby. Stroll past the line of Allsteel file cabinets in the Cannon basement and you’ll find various drawers labeled “Approps” (short for Appropriations, the committee that determines how to spend federal dollars). This is what’s called a congressional “frank,” authorized by the Constitution. The offices are generally more cramped, less opulent and even have a series of steel “cages” across the hall where some aides and interns toil. Grothman’s office features a sign declaring that “Congressman Swalwell has Moved to 129 Cannon.” Young’s doorway carries a similar message informing visitors that “The office of Rep. Alan Lowenthal has Moved to 108 Cannon HOB.” And then there is 512 Cannon. But for now, her door bears this message: “THE OFFICE OF MICHAEL G. GRIMM (NY-11) HAS MOVED TO 1725 LONGWORTH.” And sure enough, Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., who pleaded guilty last week to felony tax evasion and is now planning to resign, is now over in Longworth. One announces that the office is closed through “Monday, December 21.” Another instructs those wishing to reach Grimm’s office to phone the district office on Staten Island “if there is an emergency.” And finally, a third sign informs visitors dogs are sometimes present inside.	19	4

The indictment alleges Blankenship conspired to violate mine safety and health standards at the Upper Big Branch Mine from January 2008 until April 2010, when an explosion at the mine killed 29 coal miners. Specifically, the indictment said Blankenship was part of a conspiracy to provide advance warning of federal mine safety inspections, allowing mine bosses to conceal and cover up safety violations. The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said the root cause was Massey's ""systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts"" to conceal life-threatening problems."	10	1

CAVUTO: Well, that would not be a bad idea, let it be adjusted to inflation. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: But I do hear from a lot of CEOs, and not just like The Gap CEO type of -- they can afford this. CAVUTO: Even if you're a large multinational concern, it's one thing, but if you're running a mom-and-pop pizza shop in New York or in West Virginia, it's a whole different story. MANCHIN: Well, Neil, here's the thing. CAVUTO: Well, no, but that's a big difference between West Virginian political leaders doing it and then businesses having to suck it up to do it. MANCHIN: Well, basically, we... CAVUTO: Well, you can bark out of the orders. MANCHIN: But, Neil... CAVUTO: If they don't have the -- if they have to cut back on personnel or not hire as many, then the reality for them is, they either automate their shops or they close their shops or they limit how many they are hiring for their shops. MANCHIN: But, Neil, you know, we have had the minimum wage raised under Republicans and Democrats. Once they get in the door, then... MANCHIN: Oh, I agree. MANCHIN: Neil, then on top of that, remember, we talked about the IRS giving bonuses to delinquent employees of the federal government of a million dollars. CAVUTO: Right.

MANCHIN: Well, I'm a small business person. CAVUTO: ... that this is a burden for them and maybe what the better part of valor for now would be to focus on getting people a wage and getting a job and then, then if things pick up, then we can talk about increasing it. MANCHIN: Well, we have been -- Neil, the bottom line is things are moving forward, and basically prices are going up and we have got people getting further and further behind.

Joe Sestak is so worried about his own record, he's trying to -- trying to run against somebody that I've never met, that I don't agree with. TOOMEY: I think that, you know, some of the accusations that Joe Sestak was attributing to her, which -- you know, that I don't share those views. Let's watch. WALLACE: Let's take a bigger look at your position on taxes, Mr. Toomey. WALLACE: ... all the Bush tax cuts, if you were to cut, not eliminate but cut, the corporate tax rate -- although that would produce some economic growth and therefore some increased revenues -- there's no question that it would add trillions of dollars to the deficit. WALLACE: I want to also ask you, Mr. Toomey, about entitlements, because you have talked -- and I want to be clear here -- about letting younger Americans, not those who are currently in Social Security, not those who are close to Social Security, but younger Americans use some of their payroll taxes to invest in private accounts. TOOMEY: Well, first of all, let's be clear. And I think there could be tremendous upside both because it allows the government's financings to get squared away, but also giving workers ownership. That's why I think my campaign is doing very well, and I'm going to continue to advocate for job growth in the private sector, getting spending under control and just bringing some balance to Washington. TOOMEY: That's true, Chris. TOOMEY: The key is for me to continue to get my message out to the swing voters, to the independent voters, who understand that Washington's on the wrong track. WALLACE: Mr. Toomey, we're going to have to leave it there. WALLACE: Up next, we turn to West Virginia and their popular Democratic governor who's in the race of his life to become that state's next senator. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: Democrat Robert Byrd held his West Virginia Senate seat for 51 years, longer than anyone who's served in Congress. WALLACE: I got to tell you, Governor, this is one of the strangest races, I think, in the country this year. But one thing about, I think, now this last week, people are starting to look at who's performed in West Virginia. WALLACE: Well, Governor, let me suggest one reason you may be in a tight race, and that is that while West Virginians apparently like you, they really don't like President Obama and his policies. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN RAESE, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR WEST VIRGINIA SENATE: You have to wonder -- wonder -- about Obama and Manchin and which direction that they're going. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Governor, you can show your independence right now. We've cleaned up the environment... WALLACE: Other than cap and trade... MANCHIN: ... in two decades more... WALLACE: Excuse me, Governor, but other than cap and trade, any other areas where you disagree with the Obama policies? MANCHIN: Well, his -- the health care reform is far overreaching in areas that I don't agree with -- the 1099 part of that, the mandates. WALLACE: Let me get specific, and let's begin with health care. The concept of preexisting conditions, children not being denied from being on insurances, or elderly people in West Virginia, if you have cancer or black lung, couldn't buy insurance -- I'm not going to say no to those people until I know we can fix what's wrong with them. WALLACE: I just want to -- I just want to pin you down on this, though. WALLACE: OK. Let's talk about, as you did -- your first answer about differing with the president was about cap and trade, which, of course, is controversial in West Virginia, which is a big coal producer. MANCHIN: I've always... WALLACE: Well, let's take a look at that. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Governor, it sure sounds like you favored cap and trade. It doesn't... WALLACE: But, Governor... MANCHIN: ... make any sense. WALLACE: ... why did you in that interview in 2008 say now they're going to have to pay for the carbons, whether a cap and trade or whether it's in a carbon tax? MANCHIN: Basically, the users of the -- the users of the energy -- and that was the emitters -- let's say that the utilities for the CO2 -- whoever is emitting CO2, you have basically a parameter to fix it through technology. WALLACE: Governor... MANCHIN: China's using more coal than ever... WALLACE: Governor, I want... MANCHIN: ... than America, Chris. WALLACE: I don't want to interrupt, but I do want to give you an opportunity to talk about your opponent, John Raese. WALLACE: Governor, let me ask you... MANCHIN: Who's been able to be successful at that? WALLACE: Let me just ask you about one other issue, because you say that John Raese wants to do away with the minimum wage. MANCHIN: Well, the minimum wage -- if he's talking about minimum wage, there's no cap on it, John. There's a big difference between he and I -- me being involved in the front line of West Virginia, solving problems by bringing people together. WALLACE: Governor Manchin, we're going to have to leave it there. WALLACE: Coming up, the media controversy that's got everyone talking -- National Public Radio fires Juan Williams. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I've got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb, and I think they're identifying themselves, first and foremost, as Muslims, I get worried, I get nervous. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VIVIAN SCHILLER, PRESIDENT & CEO, NPR: His feelings that he expressed on Fox News are really between him and his, you know, psychiatrist, or his publicist, or take your pick. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Well, that was the comment from Juan Williams that stirred up so much controversy this week, and the unceremonious way that NPR executive Vivian Schiller announced his dismissal. And it's time now for our Sunday group: Brit Hume, Fox News senior political analyst; and contributors Nina Easton of ""Fortune"" magazine; Bill Kristol of ""The Weekly Standard""; and Juan Williams, formerly of National Public Radio and always of Fox News. WALLACE: I have to say, this is the first time we have seen each other, because you've been up in New York this whole week. It would have been easy for the right to say, well, you know, we've been subject to this kind of treatment from the left for a long time, but if you say something that they don't like, they call you a racist or a bigot. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COKIE ROBERTS, NPR: I'm just saying that, you know, women would be protected from regret later in life. The second point that I want to make very quickly, Chris, before you bring other people in here is this -- they suggest that I somehow violated NPR's standards, journalistic standards, by telling people about a feeling I had. I think in terms of my values, and I think -- I hope in terms of everybody's values for journalists, that people should be open and able to say this is how I feel in this situation, let's talk about it. WALLACE: Brit, we also have the case of Nina Totenberg, who's not an analyst, but NPR's legal affairs correspondent. Besides a few years ago wishing that the late Senator Jesse Helms would get AIDS for -- BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Or his grandchildren. We also have just in the last month her reaction -- remember, she covers the court -- to the court's ruling on Citizens United, a decision that said that corporations could get more involved in political campaigns. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NINA TOTENBERG, NPR COMMENTATOR: Well, you know, really, this is the next scandal. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: And again, this is a reporter who covers the court. NINA EASTON, ""FORTUNE"" MAGAZINE: It's a response that has been going back to the 1990s. BILL KRISTOL, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": So much to dislike about NPR, it's hard to know where to begin. (LAUGHTER) WALLACE: Whoever he is, he's done a heck of a job. And that just tells you everything though about -- I mean, the total lack of even enough self-awareness to know that you are the CEO of a major news organization, one that happens to get quite a lot of government funding, and you're allowed to slander people that way. WALLACE: Let me just say, buddy, that we are delighted that you are going to be here, as you have been for so many years. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We believe in a country where we look after one another, where I am my brother's keeper, where I am my sister's keeper. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH PALIN, FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR: Our message is, we don't work for you anymore, Mr. Reid. WALLACE: Nina, ""The Wall Street Journal"" had -- I was going to say a fascinating report. Unions are spending -- one of the reasons for the tightening of races, unions are spending $200 million nationwide, which undermines the theory, the narrative that the White House and other Democrats are trying to put out, which is that these nefarious business groups with anonymous donors which were allowed by the Supreme Court Citizens United decision -- which the president called out in January as a strike at the heart of democracy, by the way -- that because of that, Republicans are basically taking the election, stealing the election with all this funding. WALLACE: Let me follow up on that with you, Bill, because the Democrats would fire back and they'd say, well, OK, AFSCME is spending a lot of money. And Nina makes the point about the media loving it when President Obama -- when the Democrats, in '06, that Rahm Emanuel got praised widely in Washington, he's so clever, he's got a lot of business contribution to the Democrats. WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think they have a chance to win the Senate. HUME: Well, the thing you can't know -- and the pollsters do the best they can with their likely voter screens and where they ask people who respond to the polls a certain number of questions, trying to determine how great the chances are that they're going to come out and vote. But I do think there's a real possibility that that energy which I described will turn out voters in places we never expected we'd find them, and that it will just wash over all the efforts that are being made against it and we could have one of these great big washouts in which the House goes big, the Senate goes the works (ph), and the governorships all go, and it's just a big wipeout. He's trying to stir the youth vote because the passion -- I mean, right now there is no indication that much change is coming, because the Republicans do have the energy in this cycle. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TED LEONSIS, OWNER, WASHINGTON WIZARDS: It really isn't my team. WALLACE (voice-over): Despite his skill as a marketer, Leonsis understands the bottom line is the product on the court. WALLACE (voice-over): His other team, the Capitals, are doing great. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: And if you doubt Leonsis' claim he answers every e-mail, he says put him to the test."	98	1

Joe Manchin may be a Democrat, but he said Sunday that he has little communication with President Obama, and that the same would be true for Democrats elected to the Senate from red states. ADVERTISEMENT The West Virginian explained that moderate Democratic candidates are independent from Obama, who is unpopular with voters and has proven to be a liability for Democrats in key races. ""Saying that the president calls them up and tells them how to vote, that doesn’t happen,"" Manchin said of Democratic senators in an interview on ""CBS Sunday Morning."" ""I know that for a fact. I’m living proof of that. I’ve had very little contact with the White House,"" Manchin added. As a first-term senator from the increasingly conservative state of West Virginia, Manchin has cultivated independence from the Obama administration on certain issues, especially those related to coal or the environment."	18	4

18 12 2013	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2013/12/18/center-seat-sen-manchin-budget-deal-future-entitlement-programs.html	Center Seat: Sen. Manchin on budget deal, future of entitlement programs	4	2	1	 BAIER: Just passed the budget over the procedural hurdle known as cloture, likely to pass easily in final vote here over the next day. MANCHIN: Well first of all, I've been a Bowles-Simpson supporter from day one since I've gotten here three years ago, and I would like to see a bigger deal, because I've always believed that you have to put your financial house in order before you can do anything. But the bottom line is, with this being said, that was one of the things worked out between the Democrats and Republicans, and you had 333 vote in the House with that there, and I think we don't have a chance to amend anything. MANCHIN: Yeah, I'm probably not the right Democrat to ask about a clean debt ceiling because I have not voted. MANCHIN: The debt ceiling is going to come, right, and there is going to be something put on the table I think by the Republicans. MANCHIN: I would like to see long-term reductions, I would like to see a downward path to at least a balanced budget. GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: How do you get to a balanced budget when the deal we just had makes no dent at all in the trajectory of the country and the entitlement state, and your party which whom you are notoriously discordant on occasions, flinches even from even the chained CPI, that is a tiny little adjustment of the way we calculate inflation. MANCHIN: Well, George, it makes look at how we operate the entitlements, not looking at taking anyone's benefits away from them. And I always said my parents worked hard and they were in a little better shape and I've had other relatives that have needed a little bit more assistance, and I don't think my parents would begrudge them whatsoever on the means tested if there's had been a little bit different than someone in more need. WILL: But the Democratic mantra has been Ted Kennedy's axiom that a program for the poor is a program, because if your means test -- it will look like a program for the poor and the middle class will withdraw its support. MANCHIN: Well, we've never tried it so I don't know if it will work. JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: So the Democrats – from the Democrat's perspective on this budget, senator, the complaint has been in order to get Republican votes you could not extend unemployment insurance for those who had long-term unemployment. MANCHIN: Juan, I don't think anyone, I mean, you look at it as not being compassionate about people looking for work. WILLIAMS: Well, that's understandable, but I think part of the conversation taking place on the Hill is will Republicans ever accept tax hikes in this current environment, or is that absolutely never going to happen, can you never make a deal with Republicans in which you would say, here, we'll cut some programs but we need some revenue enhancement? Couldn't Democrats and Republicans agree that we have one tremendous debt problem in our country and they are going to say for every new dollar of revenue, no matter how we get it, 60 or 70 cents will go to debt reduction.	94	4

Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He was played off stage tonight by the Bruce Springsteen song ""Land of Hope and Dreams,"" and that nicely summarized a large part of his theme tonight. CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC:  I went back and watched the speech me that got me thrilled, physically, as everybody laughed at me, for because it did get me thrilled physically. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (INAUDIBLE) shed a tear, at one moment... (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That message about no American being more American than the other I think is an important one. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Trump's behavior throughout his first press conference as president-elect raises some serious questions, implications for American democracy, questions about how our institutions will deal with him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have a job, a job to figure out what's true or not. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising, since I just assumed he was running as a joke. (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I know you don't believe that, but I want to go on... (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Of the declared ones right now, Donald Trump. (LAUGHTER) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States, exclamation point, @Realdonaldtrump. (LAUGHTER) OBAMA:  Well, @Realdonaldtrump, at least I will go down as a president. Take a look. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SINGING) My Michelle, you the only one that we adore. Take a look. Since you're... DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENT-ELECT:  Go ahead. ACOSTA:  No, Mr. President-elect... TRUMP:  Go ahead. ACOSTA:  Mr. President-elect, since you are attacking... TRUMP:  No, not you. ACOSTA:  ... can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir? ACOSTA:  Sir, can you... TRUMP:  Quiet. ACOSTA:  Mr. President-elect, can you state... TRUMP:  Go ahead. ACOSTA:  Mr. President-elect, can you give us a question? TRUMP:  Don't be -- no, I'm not going to give you a question. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA:  In 2012, Latinos voted in record numbers. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY:  I still offer that beer, and in the spirit of spreading the wealth, Mr. President, I'll pay for it -- in celebration. HANNITY:  I think it's, like, 15 times he mentioned me, something like that, yes. HANNITY:  But should the... MALKIN:  Only after -- only after Obama had done so much damage, Sean, do these people finally admit that yes, yes, we should have asked more questions. Now these people realize... HANNITY:  Well, let me ask a final question... MALKIN:  ... that there should a proper watchdog role for the press? HANNITY:  Isn't there a lesson here in what we saw happen this week, the hyperventilating, the breathlessness, the, Wow, we got him. They thought they had him this week, that the Trump campaign should understand that they don't like him, they'll never like him, and their goal -- and tell me if I'm bordering on paranoia -- they want to destroy him and they're waiting for the moment to jump. MALKIN:  Yes, it's going to be a long four years, Sean, but I think that over the course of the campaign -- and this goes for all of the people on the right -- you know, whatever they thought about any particular policy position or personnel choice that Trump had made -- and certainly, I have been vocal about when I liked or didn't like certain things he said or certain choices he made -- and the difference, of course, is that over the course of the next four years, Sean, I know that you, just as we did during the Bush administration, will be very vocal when we're happy and we'll be very vocal when we're not. HANNITY:  All right, Michelle Malkin, good to see you. And then later tonight... (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN FALLON, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN:  Donald Trump is someone who's very insecure in his victory, and I understand why. So... KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP:  Thank you. I would submit to you it's why he won the presidency because people know that he will make good on these promises, his plan, because if he doesn't, he's just another typical politician promising to do things they don't intend. HANNITY:  So... CONWAY:  If the Congress can speed up the process by paying for it, terrific. HANNITY:  So vetting refugees, originalist justices, seven brackets to three, 15 percent corporate tax, repatriating multi-national corporations, ObamaCare gone, replaced with what you said, energy independence, that's going to be done. If you can tell me right now -- I'll start the jeopardy clock -- what Hillary Clinton's message was in this election, other than Donald Trump bad and... HANNITY:  I can't tell you what she did... CONWAY:  ... HANNITY:  I can't tell you... (CROSSTALK) HANNITY:  All right, let me ask this last question. CONWAY:  So on Monday, January 3rd (sic), President Donald J. Trump can sit down and basically rescind these executive orders, those that Obama put in very late in the game, with respect to the environment, mining -- there are other regulations that we hear from business owners and employers constantly, Sean, that it's really the regulatory system that has a chokehold on them, that they can't retain talent and they can't hire American workers. And it's just the stroke of a pen, really, that allows President Trump to go more in line with what Americans expect. HANNITY:  Kellyanne, it's a bold agenda. CONWAY:  And they can do this (INAUDIBLE) governors, state legislatures. This is really the time to harness that and... HANNITY:  And by the way, we don't need... CONWAY:  ... act more like a business... HANNITY:  ... their $10 trillion debt limit increase, either. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN FALLON, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN:  Donald Trump is someone who's very insecure in his victory, and I understand why. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY:  All right, Fallon is not the only Democrat trying to make excuses for President-elect Trump's win. Also today, in a pre-recorded interview set to air on ""Meet the Press"" this weekend, Congressman John Lewis of Georgia says he doesn't see Donald Trump as a legitimate president. Let me start with what you have... SEN. JOE MANCHIN, D-WEST VIRGINIA:  Hey, Sean, always good to be with you. He's reached out, which is what you would think a president-elect coming in, reaching across the aisle, wanting to get things done, seeing if we can find people that'll work together, move things forward, but the country first, put the campaign behind us, put the election behind us, put the Democrats and Republicans behind us and let's bring America to the forefront. HANNITY:  We still have 95 million Americans out of the labor force, 43 million Americans on food stamps, 50 million in poverty and the lowest home ownership rate of 51 years. MANCHIN:  Yes, and I spoke to President-elect Trump about that. HANNITY:  As far as I know up until know you are the only Senate Democrat that will vote to confirm Senator Sessions, a colleague, as the new attorney general. MANCHIN:  When I see politics dives to that degree, and you know, and like you say, whether it's on my side of the aisle, the Democratic side, and Sean, let me make it very clear. HANNITY:  All right, senator, always good to have you. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY:  You heard him say it, ObamaCare will be repealed and replaced under the new administration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:  Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us. That will happen. REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN, R-TENNESSEE:  What we have, Sean, you can go back to 2010 to the Blair House health care summit, and we pretty much laid out our plan then. HANNITY:  With the freedom caucus, Jim Jordan, and I see you are here, Mark Meadows who is now I guess the head of your Freedom Caucus, or the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. HANNITY:  Louie Gohmert, a lot of conservatives are writing and calling my radio show and tweeting out their concern about three things, the $1 trillion infrastructure without a plan to pay for it. REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, R-TEXAS:  Yes, the number one thing we do first is repeal ObamaCare. And I do think that Mexico is ultimately going to realize that once we cut off the flow of drugs back and forth and the people that are paying the drug cartels to come across, then Mexico quits being such a corrupt country with all the drug cartels, and they are going to want to pay us, because they will zoom up to be not 62nd in the number of economics -- HANNITY:  Let me ask a question. BLACKBURN:  One of the things when we talk about infrastructure that people are saying is, look, we want you to look at broadband expansion, rural broadband. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:  Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us, and they will reimburse us for the cost of this wall. That will happen. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:  Mexico in some form, and there are many forms, will reimburse us, and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY:  President-elect Trump, he says Mexico will pay for the wall. HANNITY:  But I always stop here and say there are 43 million Americans on food stamps, 50 million in poverty and 95 million out of the labor force. RIVERA:  I have no problem with that either, except if you are really a capitalist free trader, we have to figure a way, what's best for the goose is best for the gander. RIVERA:  But the idea of the North American Free Trade Agreement was the Mexico, Canada, and the United States are all in the -- yes, because the United States was getting shortchanged. (LAUGHTER) RIVERA:  He loves you, too. HANNITY:  Good to see you, Geraldo."	94	4

MANCHIN: Neil, we already have one heck of a distraction going on now. MANCHIN: I would think that, as the president and the White House, having someone the stature as Bob Mueller would get this done in an expedited matter, get -- unturn all of the stones, if you will, see everything, and let's move on and do the business of this country. CAVUTO: All right, very quickly, we're also learning the markets were down a little bit today, Senator. CAVUTO: Senator, Claire McCaskill -- I think it was Claire McCaskill -- was not a big fan of the possibility of Joe Lieberman being the next FBI director, that a politician or someone who had elected office shouldn't be considered for that job. MANCHIN: Well, let me just say this, Neil. The difficult times we're in, the challenging times we're in, if they can find that person, if they can pull that Bob Mueller out of the ranks of the professions that doesn't lean right, left, you don't know whether they're Democrat or Republican, that's probably what we need right now. And I will -- and the only thing I have said, if Joe Lieberman is there, his friend Joe Manchin, who knows him very well, is going to be with him. CAVUTO: You know, yesterday, or this morning, sir, the president said -- tweeted out that this is the single greatest witch-hunt of a politician in American history. MANCHIN: And I don't see anybody, I haven't seen anybody with -- all lathered up, if you will, it's a witch-hunt, and we're going after them. CAVUTO: All right, Senator, thank you very much.

9 4 2018	https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/09/us/politics/09reuters-oklahoma-education.html	Oklahoma Teachers Press Lawmakers for Tax Plan to End Strike	3	3	1	" OKLAHOMA CITY —  Thousands of Oklahoma teachers packed the state Capitol on Monday to press the Republican-dominated legislature to enact a capital gains tax overhaul that educators said could help end a statewide walkout now in its second week. During a rally filled with live music and speeches, the teachers called for increased spending for an education system where inflation-adjusted funding per student dropped by 28.2 percent between 2008 and 2018, the biggest reduction of any state, according to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""We are asking them to fully fund the future and create sustained revenue,"" said Jenni Morrison, 37, a teacher from Edmond who has been at the Capitol every day since the strike began on April 2. Public schools serving about 500,000 of the state's 700,000 students were closed on Monday. That includes Oklahoma City and Tulsa, which said they would close again on Tuesday. Organizers said Monday's protest could be the largest since the walkout began, drawing as many as 40,000 people. Since late March, lawmakers have approved nearly $450 million in new taxes and revenue to help fund teachers' pay and education, but that is still short of the $600 million being sought by teachers. Lawmakers on Monday discussed a bill that would remove a tax exemption on capital gains and bring in about $100 million. If enacted, the union has said it would be a major step toward ending the strike. They also want lawmakers to implement a hotel tax that would bring in an estimated $50 million. The strike has garnered strong public backing, with a statewide survey from Sooner Poll last Friday showing that 72.1 percent of respondents supported the walkout. Educators in other states, increasingly angry over stagnating wages, are also considering walkouts. Opponents of the Oklahoma tax hikes said lawmakers could bolster education spending by cutting bureaucracy and waste rather than raising taxes. The new taxes and revenue approved by lawmakers translate into an average teacher pay raise of about $6,100. Teachers are seeking a $10,000 raise over three years. The minimum salary for a first-year teacher is currently $31,600, state data shows."	11	7

Spoiler: They Did Not.	3	3	1	 It seemed as though Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the creators of HBO’s “Westworld,” had given up. So, like a soon-to-be-exiled employee insisting “You can’t fire me because I quit,”  they told their Reddit superfans on Monday  they would reveal the entire plot of the second season in a 25-minute video, released less than two weeks before its premiere on April 22. The theory: If all the plot details were known ahead of time, the community’s moderators could potentially squelch any open discussion of them, protecting the rest of the community from stumbling upon the truth. For those who chose to watch the video, spoilers wouldn’t drip out through questionable sources — they’d be confirmed, complete and present top-of-mind throughout the viewing experience. News sites   earnestly   dissected   the decision  to create the video and its implications, while Reddit commenters tied themselves in knots debating whether they’d watch. Evan Rachel Wood, who plays Dolores, appears and softly sings “We’re no strangers to love.” Savvy viewers start to put together what’s going on. The 10-year-old internet prank — tricking people into clicking on a video of the British singer Rick Astley’s 1987 hit song “Never Gonna Give You Up” — had its heyday but hasn’t been much of a thing for a while now. The song in the “Westworld” video is followed by 22 minutes of a dog sitting in front of a piano as the show’s theme plays on a loop. The misdirection also offered a look at how “Westworld” might interact with the rampant speculation on Reddit, where the line between theory and spoiler disintegrated as users predicted all of the major twists in the show’s first season. “When those theories have been taken out of a site like Reddit and put into headlines, that’s a bummer.” The video left the  “Westworld” community on Reddit  a very confusing place. Some of the commenters who hadn’t watched the video appeared to have no idea they had merely avoided a Rick Astley cover, while those who had seen it were delighted to be in on the joke.	3	5

Bieber was also mentoring Brody Hinz, 18, the team statistician and radio station intern who died in the crash, Lydon Frieson, president of Golden West Radio, said in a statement posted on the station's website. Bieber also coached the Humboldt high school's basketball and football teams, Wilson said. ___ GIVING LIFE TO OTHERS Logan Boulet signed his organ donor card when he turned 21 a few weeks ago and made his wishes very clear to his family, his godfather, Neil Langevin, said on Facebook. He was sent to join the Broncos for the playoffs after his previous team, the Regina Pat Canadians, finished their season, said John Smith, his former team's manager.

Under the federal law Trump invoked in his proclamation calling for National Guard troops, governors who send troops retain command and control over their state's Guard members and the U.S. government picks up the cost. Trump said last week he wants to send 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard members to the border, issuing a proclamation citing ""the lawlessness that continues at our southern border."" Some Guard members will be armed if they are placed in potential danger, Abbott said, adding he wanted to downplay speculation that ""our National Guard is showing up with military bayonets trying to take on anybody that's coming across the border, because that is not their role."""	9	6

For example, we could become aware of a story that we want to monitor (and possibly cover) when a tweet from a local Houston reporter says something like, “Gunshots fired in Harris County Institute of the Forensic Sciences.” And then seconds later, another one from a different account says, “Whoa im in Houston and I think i just heard fireworks or maybe gunfire?? They’re often tweets that we might not otherwise have seen, because they come from, for example, a cloud computing consultant in Houston who has 43 followers on Twitter. I wouldn’t see that on Twitter for hours, but Dataminr would bring it to my attention right away. And I still sometimes web surf like an old, using an RSS reader (Feedly). For trending news, what we hope to do is put together patterns that others may not have, or to put a new spin on a story that’s already out there. I also use Twitter to follow the news, which sometimes helps me find patterns. (I can’t use Tweetdeck, and I’m always impressed that people are able to, by the way.) We also have a pretty active Slack culture on my team, and we get a lot of ideas (like  one by my teammate Maya Salam on showering ) just from talking about dumb things with one another, saying whether we prefer rice, bread or potatoes, that kind of thing. I use  Sennheiser headphones  when I want to listen to music closely, and those little Sony over-ear headphones (the ones that came with Discmen) for listening to music on the go. I thought they belonged to my roommate (someone had opened the outer layer of the box), but he told me they weren’t his. The over-ear headphones get blown out kind of easily, but you can order replacements on Amazon and they are super cheap. There is now so much tech out there — tweets, Facebook posts, phone notifications and more — to distract us. I  deleted Facebook from my phone  last year, so that’s gone. I don’t have any magic tricks or anything, though, and I get distracted pretty easily. And when I need to write something on deadline, I minimize Slack and put my stolen headphones on.	71	3

It’s happening and it’s intensifying.” He added, “All the opposition research will have been done for Joe Donnelly at that point.” Mr. Rokita said he had no concerns that the attacks would help the incumbent Democrat. And I want them to know about me.” Referring to two previous Republican presidential candidates, John R. Kasich and Mitt Romney, Mr. Rokita added: “Messer at this point is like all losing candidates, like Kasich or Romney, ‘if you beat up on me, we are all going to lose.’ Absolutely wrong. Mr. Rokita’s “elites” are something else to Mr. Grand: “People that know what’s good for the Republican Party, yes, longstanding Republicans, yes. People who know how to elect Republican candidates.” “Or,” he asked, does Mr. Rokita “want to go back to the group that gave us Mourdock?” That was a reference to Richard E. Mourdock, a candidate whose backing from Tea Party groups and national conservative organizations six years ago led to the  defeat of a   longtime incumbent Republican, Senator Richard G. Lugar , in the Indiana primary. That was a gift that kept on giving.” Mr. Braun dismissed Mr. Rokita as a “smash mouth.” “He’ll do and say things that might impress,” he said. “If he’s trying to act like Trump it’s kind of a poor impression.” He also said there could be lingering damage: “When you’ve got sharp elbows, that creates a long memory for the people hit by those elbows.” He rejected Mr. Rokita’s charge that he was a recent Republican convert, saying he had never voted for a Democrat for a federal office. Mr. Messer, whose campaign so far has been the most measured of the three, accused Mr. Rokita of “trying to make things up.” “It’s crazy,” Mr. Messer said.	0	1

Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: “President Trump’s continued waffling on whether to stay in or withdraw from the Paris Agreement made it impossible to reach consensus at the Taormina summit on the need for ambitious climate action. “There’s a situation where it’s six — if you count the European Union, seven — against one.” President Emmanuel Macron of France said he had told Mr. Trump it was “indispensable for the reputation of the United States and for the Americans themselves that the Americans remain committed” to the climate agreement. It says the United States is “in the process of reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics.” The president did not mention the impasse in his only public remarks after the summit meeting, to American troops at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily. He succeeded at busting norms, but not building good will.” The American national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, said that Mr. Trump’s participation in the ceremony was an implicit endorsement of Article 5. In a  message on Twitter  on Saturday, he said, “I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!” There is an intense debate inside the West Wing over whether to withdraw from the accord or to try to renegotiate its terms, pitting hard-line nationalists, like Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist, against more mainstream advisers like Mr. Cohn. On Thursday, Mr. Cohn told reporters that Mr. Trump’s thinking on the subject was “evolving.” But other senior officials said that even if the United States remained in the agreement, it could effectively gut its principles. In a recent letter to Mr. Trump from 10 state attorneys general, West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, wrote, “Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement is an important and necessary step toward reversing the harmful energy policies and unlawful overreach of the Obama era.” On trade, Mr. Trump pushed his demand that any agreements negotiated by the United States must be fair. Shortly after Air Force One took off from Sicily for Washington, Mr. Trump  said on Twitter  that he had enjoyed “great” meetings on trade, saying, “We push for the removal of all trade-distorting practices....to foster a truly level playing field.”	95	4

In an interview at the start of the festival, Aix’s outgoing general director, Bernard Foccroulle, described his vision as one in which opera has “a vivid and creative relationship to the past, with a focus that is of our time.” The model should be one of “participation, not consumerism,” and he has sought to anchor the festival in larger artistic communities and to make connections with the broader Mediterranean world. Mr. Foccroulle’s approach was evident in the other work I saw at Aix, Bizet’s “ Carmen .” It’s opera’s ultimate golden oldie, but Dmitri Tcherniakov’s production, meticulously staged and performed with rare intensity, questions why we keep coming back to this story. I can’t, however, make the same promise of accessibility when it comes to Krzysztof Warlikowski’s production of Franz Schreker’s 1918 rarity, “ Die Gezeichneten ,” which had its premiere at the Bavarian State Opera the previous week. In Zurich, a revival of Andreas Homoki’s production of Wagner’s “ Lohengrin ” offered a very different model of what opera can be. Mr. Homoki’s rejection of allegory is unusual for “Lohengrin,” an opera whose questions of faith, trust and social cohesion have often lent themselves to fanciful interpretations, like Hans Neuenfels’s mouse-themed  production  for the Bayreuth Festival in Germany. It’s also noteworthy that all these productions featured prominent, and excellent, performances by American singers: As well as Ms. Naglestad, Mr. Jovanovich and Ms. Willis-Sorensen, the list also included Michael Fabiano in “Carmen,” and Paul Appleby and Julia Bullock in “Rake’s Progress.” You hope they will bring something from these adventurous and intense operatic experiments back home.	63	4

10 5 2016	https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/us/politics/west-virginia-primary-preview.html	Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton Court West Virginians Hit Hard by Coal’s Decline	2	3	1	 But what people here bring up is a comment she made about coal workers in March, when she said during a televised forum, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” She was talking about providing opportunity through clean energy, and she emphasized that coal miners must not be left behind, but the sound bite was a damning one. At a round-table event, Bo Copley, a 39-year-old father who had lost his job in the coal industry, told her, “I just want to know how you can say you’re going to put a lot of coal miners out of jobs and then come in here and tell us how you’re going to be our friend.” Mrs. Clinton called her comment a “misstatement” and expressed regret. “This is a ghost town, because when the coal goes out, it hurts all of us.” In the last quarter of 2011, West Virginia had about 24,700 coal mining jobs; by the last quarter of 2015, that number had fallen to about 14,500, a decline of more than 40 percent, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence.	45	7
6 5 2016	https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/us/politics/hillary-clinton-republican-party.html	Hillary Clinton Targets Republicans Turned Off by Donald Trump	2	3	1	 In February, he said that Mrs. Clinton would be “a tremendous president.” Mrs. Clinton’s two-day swing across Appalachia this week served as the beginning of the campaign’s full-court press to convince persuadable white voters that she would run a more inclusive campaign than Mr. Trump — and to signal that she would cede no demographic group to him.	100	4
8 9 2017	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/movies/fall-movie-releases-2017.html	Fall 2017 Movie Release Schedule	8	3	1	 EX LIBRIS — THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY  A tireless chronicler of American institutions, Frederick Wiseman, now 87, documents the inner workings of one of the world’s largest and most recognizable library systems, where even phone operators are handy with Middle English, and the photo file is so detailed that it contains a folder of “dogs in action.” AGAINST THE NIGHT  Among the places you might not want to go on late-night excursions with your friends, “abandoned prisons” rank roughly third, behind only “haunted abandoned prisons” and “haunted abandoned prisons once run by wardens who turned their inmates into biochemical test subjects.” AMERICAN ASSASSIN  A veteran C.I.A. EASY LIVING  Adam Keleman’s debut feature is not a remake of the Jean Arthur comedy classic from 1937, written by Preston Sturges, but it does concern old movies, or at least a door-to-door saleswoman (Caroline Dhavernas) who finds them inspirational. WOODPECKERS  At a prison in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, an inmate (Jean Jean) begins a clandestine, sign-language-enabled courtship with a prisoner (Judith Rodriguez Perez) in the nearby women’s penitentiary. THIRST STREET  An American flight attendant (Lindsay Burdge) has a fling with a Frenchman (Damien Bonnard), only to have his ex-girlfriend (Esther Garrel) turn up, in the latest psychological whirlwind from Nathan Silver (“Stinking Heaven”). Matthew Vaughn’s follow-up serves at least one good cause — keeping Julianne Moore employed, here as a villain — and also stars Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Channing Tatum, Colin Firth, Halle Berry and Elton John (?!). STRONGER  David Gordon Green, a long way from his indie roots (“George Washington,” “All the Real Girls”), dramatizes the true story of  Jeff Bauman  (Jake Gyllenhaal), who lost both of his legs in the Boston Marathon bombing. THE TIGER HUNTER  An Indian tiger hunter’s son (Danny Pudi, from “Community”), having emigrated to Chicago, puts on a charade to pretend he’s more successful than he is when the woman he loves pays a visit. Stephen Frears, already familiar with British royalty from “The Queen” (2006), chronicles the resulting friendship. I AM ANOTHER YOU  After meeting a man who is a drifter, seemingly by choice, in Florida, the Chinese documentarian Nanfu Wang (“Hooligan Sparrow”) followed him across the United States. FLATLINERS  Evidently none of the characters in this reimagining was cool enough to watch Joel Schumacher’s “Flatliners,” the 1990 hit that featured Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon as medical students who took turns stopping one another’s hearts. LITERALLY, RIGHT BEFORE AARON  It’s Adam (Justin Long) who was, literally or figuratively, the boyfriend right before Aaron (Ryan Hansen), the man Allison (Cobie Smulders), Adam’s ex, is about to marry. Peter Landesman (“Parkland,” which revolved around the John F. Kennedy assassination) directed. Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”) directed, and Harrison Ford returns as Deckard. This documentary, directed by David France (“How to Survive a Plague”), is “both a true-crime mystery and an elegy for the old West Village,” Mike Hale  wrote  in The New York Times when it screened at the Tribeca Film Festival. DEMENTIA 13  Sure, everything seems to be rebooted these days, but was anyone expecting a remake of the 1963 horror film “Dementia 13,” arguably Francis Ford Coppola’s first feature (discounting his apprentice work for Roger Corman and soft-core films)? EARTH: ONE AMAZING DAY  Richard Dale, Peter Webber and Fan Lixin directed this sequel to the 2009 nature documentary “Earth,” which Jeannette Catsoulis  described  in The Times as “nature defanged and declawed for kiddie consumption.” FACES PLACES  For her latest personal essay and travelogue in the vein of “The Gleaners and I,” the French new wave legend Agnès Varda has shared directing and M.C.-ing duties with the French street artist JR. Over the course of a road trip, as they reflect on French culture and camaraderie, he comes to seem like a natural successor to her sensibility. THE FLORIDA PROJECT  Sean Baker makes movies about “unseen” communities in plain sight: transgender prostitutes and cabdrivers in Los Angeles (“Tangerine”), say, or the world of pornographic filmmaking in “Starlet.” An unlikely crowd-pleaser, “The Florida Project” is centered on a seedy motel near Disney World, where Mr. Baker’s 6-year-old heroine (the exuberant Brooklynn Prince) lives jubilantly, despite poverty and squalid surroundings. THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN US  In a big change of pace, the Palestinian filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad (“Omar,” “Paradise Now”) directs Kate Winslet and Idris Elba in a survival picture. Ana de Armas also stars in the movie, which looks like a calculated appeal to fans of “The Fast and the Furious.” PARADISE  Andrei Konchalovsky (“Runaway Train”) directed this Holocaust story, shot in black and white, about a Russian woman in the French Resistance and a German officer she knows from before the war. IT  Stephen Gyllenhaal, Jake and Maggie’s father, directed this adaptation of Sarah Weeks’s  young-adult novel  about a 12-year-old (Talitha Bateman) who goes on a journey to discover why her mother knows fewer than two dozen words. TAKE EVERY WAVE: THE LIFE OF LAIRD HAMILTON   Mr. Hamilton , a titan of surfing, is profiled by the documentarian Rory Kennedy (“Last Days in Vietnam”). UNA  In a screen version of David Harrower’s play “Blackbird” — which ran Off Broadway with Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill and, a decade later, on Broadway with Mr. Daniels and Michelle Williams — Ben Mendelsohn and Rooney Mara play a middle-aged man and the woman with whom he had an illegal sexual relationship when she was a girl, who confronts him 15 years later. WALKING OUT  Alex and Andrew J. Smith (“The Slaughter Rule”), chroniclers of their native Montana, direct this lean survivalist film about a father and son (Matt Bomer and Josh Wiggins) whose rare time together turns harrowing after complications on a hunting trip. Bill Pullman appears in flashbacks, and Lily Gladstone (“Certain Women”) turns up briefly. 78/52: HITCHCOCK’S SHOWER SCENE  You might call Alexandre O. Philippe’s documentary a behind-the-scenes portrait — except that it’s more like a behind-the-scene portrait, a feature-length examination of the moment of Marion Crane’s death in “Psycho” from technical, historical and theoretical angles. THE DEPARTURE  Lana Wilson (a director of “After Tiller”) films a profile of Ittetsu Nemoto, an erstwhile punk rocker and Buddhist priest who offers support for the suicidal. It sounds like something out of David Lynch, but it’s an animated feature from Peter Lepeniotis (“The Nut Job”) and Shelly Shenoy. THE MEYEROWITZ STORIES (NEW AND SELECTED)  Dysfunctional families aren’t exactly new territory for Noah Baumbach, but this bittersweet and often just plain bitter comedy about three siblings (Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller and Elizabeth Marvel), healing old wounds and dealing with their cantankerous father (Dustin Hoffman), got a warm reception at Cannes in May. For that, Angela Robinson’s biopic tells the story of Wonder Woman’s creator, a psychologist who maintained a hidden life with his wife (Rebecca Hall) and their lover (Bella Heathcote). TE ATA  Q’orianka Kilcher (“The New World”) plays Mary Thompson Fisher, known as Te Ata, a Chickasaw performer whose celebrated career included appearances before Franklin D. Roosevelt. L’ENFANT SECRET  This 1979 film by Philippe Garrel (“I Can No Longer Hear the Guitar”) will receive its first run in the United States, following a showing at the New York Film Festival and a retrospective of that French auteur’s work at the Metrograph in New York. BPM (BEATS PER MINUTE)  Robin Campillo, a regular screenwriting collaborator of Laurent Cantet’s (“The Class”), took the Grand Prix at Cannes, the equivalent of second place, for this powerful look at AIDS activists in Paris in the early 1990s, with a focus on protests and strategy. Dean Devlin, a frequent writer and producer on Roland Emmerich’s movies (“Independence Day,” the 1998 “Godzilla”), orchestrates the mayhem. ONLY THE BRAVE  Josh Brolin stars as the leader of the Granite Mountain Hotshots — wildfire specialists called “the Seal Team 6 of firefighters” in the trailer — in a portrait of the group’s bravery, based on a GQ magazine article. ONE OF US  The documentarians Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady (“Detropia,” “Jesus Camp”) capture three years in the lives of three Hasidic New Yorkers who have left their ultra-Orthodox communities. WHERE’S THE MONEY  To retrieve stolen money, a black student (the comedian Andrew Bachelor) at the University of Southern California rushes a very white fraternity. ALL I SEE IS YOU  Pulling a gender swap on the Val Kilmer–Mira Sorvino vehicle “At First Sight,” this film from Marc Forster (“World War Z”) casts Blake Lively as a woman who, having been blinded in her youth, regains sight in one eye, thanks to an operation. In a cloistered Swiss village in 1971, a housewife (Marie Leuenberger) picks up the torch for women’s liberation; the movement she starts jolts the conservative populace. FÉLICITÉ  The filmmaker Alain Gomis, who will bring his first feature to the New York Film Festival this fall, directed this story of a singer (Véro Tshanda Beya Mputu) in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, who desperately needs money to pay for her injured son’s recovery. THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER  Winner of a screenwriting prize at Cannes, this warped blend of horror film and morality play from Yorgos Lanthimos (“The Lobster”) stars Colin Farrell as a cardiologist and Barry Keoghan (“Dunkirk”) as an ingratiating boy who knows something about his past. MR. ROOSEVELT  Noël Wells (“Master of None”) wrote, directed and stars in her debut feature, playing a comedian who returns from Los Angeles to Austin, Tex., and finds that her world there has changed. NOVITIATE  Maggie Betts directs this powerful film about a young woman (Margaret Qualley, from “The Leftovers”) who decides to become a nun after attending Roman Catholic school. THE SQUARE  “Force Majeure” already brought the Swedish director Ruben Ostlund international attention (especially after a  YouTube video , possibly tongue-in-cheek, showed him melting down while watching the Oscar nominations). BAD BLOOD THE MOVIE  Here’s a problem that Taylor Swift wouldn’t even try to solve: After an attack on a full-moon night, a college-age woman (Mary Malloy) turns into a vicious monster. ALONG FOR THE RIDE  When “Easy Rider” (1969) was a runaway success, Hollywood briefly believed that Dennis Hopper was a bankable director. Universal Pictures gave him a budget and the chance to make “The Last Movie” (1971), a fiasco by reputation that time has treated kindly. There has already been one documentary about its legendarily chaotic making, “The American Dreamer.” This one is based on anecdotes told to the director Nick Ebeling and covers some of Hopper’s later career as well. LAST FLAG FLYING  Set in 2003, the opening-night feature at this year’s New York Film Festival is said to be a riff on Hal Ashby’s “The Last Detail.” Richard Linklater directs Steve Carell, Laurence Fishburne and Bryan Cranston as old Vietnam War pals who travel together to bury Mr. Carell’s character’s son, killed in Iraq. Denzel Washington is the title character in this legal drama, written and directed by Dan Gilroy (“Nightcrawler”). BITCH  A housewife who’s been taken for granted (Marianna Palka, the movie’s writer and director) takes up residence in her house’s basement and begins behaving like a most un-housebroken dog. DADDY’S HOME 2  When we last saw Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell, they had buried the hatchet and found a way to split parenting duties (Mr. Ferrell’s character being married to Linda Cardellini, who plays the mother of Mr. Wahlberg’s children). INTENT TO DESTROY: DEATH, DENIAL & DEPICTION  The veteran documentarian Joe Berlinger (the “Paradise Lost” trilogy) chronicles the making of Terry George’s film  “The Promise,”  a rare large-scale production about the Armenian genocide. With Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts and Lucas Hedges (who gave a standout performance as Casey Affleck’s nephew in “Manchester by the Sea”). THELMA  Perhaps a return to form by the Norwegian director Joachim Trier — his last feature, the English-language  “Louder Than Bombs,”  met with a mixed reception from critics — “Thelma” centers on a repressed young woman (Eili Harboe) who leaves her remote hometown to study in Oslo. THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI  When she suspects that a police chief (Woody Harrelson) hasn’t done enough to solve her daughter’s murder, a mother (Frances McDormand) puts that message on three billboards — ticking off a sizable portion of the town. It’s a comedy, of the bleak variety that Martin McDonagh (“In Bruges”) usually makes. MUDBOUND  Widely acclaimed at Sundance, the new film from Dee Rees (“Pariah”) is a “they don’t make ’em like they used to” Hollywood-style epic that also tells its story in a way Hollywood never did: Set in the Mississippi Delta around World War II, the movie accords equal weight to the lives of a black sharecropping family (Mary J. Blige, Rob Morgan and Jason Mitchell) and white landowners (Carey Mulligan, Jason Clarke and Garrett Hedlund). (At least twice a year, it’s fair to expect a new movie about a filmmaker and his fumbling, soju-addled interactions with women.) “On the Beach at Night Alone,” one of three Hong features to have its premiere in 2017, is said to be even more private, a reflection on how the South Korean news media reacted to word of Mr. Hong’s relationship with his latest muse, Kim Min-hee, who plays an actress (of course), and who won a prize at the Berlin Film Festival for her performance in it. This science-fiction movie looks like it’s geared for fans of “District 9.” THE STAR  In this animated feature, the first Christmas is seen from the vantage points of a donkey (voiced by Steven Yeun) and other animals, who sound a lot like Keegan-Michael Key, Kelly Clarkson, Ving Rhames and Gabriel Iglesias. For this “reimagining,” Eli Roth (“Hostel”) directed and Joe Carnahan (“The Grey”) wrote the script, so expect an uptick in gore. THE MAN WHO INVENTED CHRISTMAS  Like “Finding Neverland” and “Goodbye Christopher Robin” (see above), “The Man Who Invented Christmas” seems predicated on the notion that most interesting underpinnings of any work of fiction are the autobiographical elements that inspired it. We’ll find out in his directorial debut, based on the true story of Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain), who was known for arranging secret poker games for well-heeled, sometimes famous players and was  named in an indictment  in 2013 for her role in a gambling ring. BOMBSHELL: THE HEDY LAMARR STORY  Ms. Lamarr scandalized filmgoers when she skinny-dipped in Gustav Machaty’s “Ecstasy” (1933), but this documentary argues that there was a much more consequential surprise in her career: She was an unheralded inventor. One of its actors, Greg Sestero, along with Tom Bissell, wrote an account of that film’s making, and now James Franco has turn that account into a movie, casting himself as Tommy Wiseau, the fiercely independent personality who willed “The Room” into being. THE OTHER SIDE OF HOPE  That’s the perfect title for a film by Aki Kaurismaki, the bleakly comic Finnish filmmaker of “Le Havre” and “The Man Without a Past.” He won best director at the Berlin Film Festival for this tale of a restaurant owner (Sakari Kuosmanen) who befriends a Syrian (Sherwan Haji) seeking asylum in Helsinki. FILM STARS DON’T DIE IN LIVERPOOL  Annette Bening channels Gloria Grahame, the glamorous,  scandalous  star of “In a Lonely Place,” in her twilight years in England (after the collapse of her marriage to her former stepson, Tony Ray). FERDINAND  “The Story of Ferdinand,” the 1936  children’s book  by Munro Leaf about a gentle bull who “liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers,” charges onto the screen in an animated feature from Carlos Saldanha (the “Ice Age” movies). STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI  “Last” is not a word in the “Star Wars” vocabulary, especially in an age when — as with Peter Cushing in 2016’s stand-alone episode, “Rogue One” — the actors no longer need to be alive to perform in the movie. When we left Rey (Daisy Ridley) in “The Force Awakens,” she was dangling a light saber at Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Rian Johnson (“Looper”) directed this installment, employing a  record-low  number of wipe transitions. Jean-Louis Trintignant (from Mr. Haneke’s “Amour”) is the head of a rich, venal family; Isabelle Huppert, a Haneke regular, is in the cast as well. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN  Well, this is a novelty act — or at least might have been before the success of “La La Land”: a modern, straight-to-screen musical, based on the rise of P. T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman). The songs are by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who collaborated on “La La Land.” UNTITLED PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON FILM  Relatively little is known about Paul Thomas Anderson’s first feature since “Inherent Vice” (2014), except that it reunites him with Daniel Day-Lewis — unforgettable in “There Will Be Blood” — and that it centers on a dressmaker who tailors for the crème de la crème of London in the 1950s.	35	5
7 11 2017	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/movies/hello-again-review.html	Review: ‘Hello Again,’ a Movie Musical Ode to Love and Lust Over Decades	8	3	1	 In recent years, the movie musical has struggled for its complete resurrection as a genre, in efforts ranging from the Hollywood high-flown ( “Into the Woods” ) to the modest and quirky (Jeffrey St. Jules’s little-seen  “Bang Bang Baby,”  from 2014). And now, somewhere between the two, lies  “Hello Again,”  Tom Gustafson’s florid adaptation of  Michael John LaChiusa’s  1993 Off Broadway show (itself based on Arthur Schnitzler’s “La Ronde”). And then it’s off to a coupling between a prostitute and a soldier in 1901; a tryst between a rich man (T. R. Knight) and a younger one on the Titanic; a 1920s affair in a movie theater involving an adulteress (Rumer Willis); a Greenwich Village disco hookup in the 1970s; and so on.	47	5

19 8 2016	https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/world/americas/alienated-and-angry-coal-miners-see-donald-trump-as-their-only-choice.html	Alienated and Angry, Coal Miners See Donald Trump as Their Only Choice	2	3	1	 Even as  Donald J. Trump , the Republican presidential nominee, lags badly in crucial swing states and  loses his grip on white male voters over all , he remains on solid ground here with  his promise  to “bring back coal.” The fact that his Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton,  said in March , “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” has helped, too. “Because those people out there don’t see you as a friend.” Days later, at a Trump rally in the state capital, Charleston, Mr. Copley received a standing ovation. “Trump is a break from the status quo, which promises the moon but doesn’t deliver.” He struck a chord across coal country, giving voice to the inchoate rage and impotence that has accompanied the near-collapse, in less than a decade, of a lucrative industry. Political fury in Mingo County focuses squarely on the Environmental Protection Agency and President Obama, who is seen as having started a “war on coal.” Issues of race and class bubble under the surface: Mingo County, population 27,000, is 97 percent white, and racial epithets that are taboo in much of America still ring out openly. Of the Confederate flag, he said, “That’s heritage, not hate.” Mr. Matney, who was in Williamson to play Pokémon Go with his girlfriend, is a linesman for a telecommunications company that, he said, is losing 500 customers a month.	1	5

As Mr. Copley put it, “Coal is secondary to me.” It is difficult for outsiders to fathom how deeply faith and work are intertwined here, or the economic and psychological depression that sets in when an entire region loses the only livelihood many of its people have ever known. “We’re a forgotten people,” Ms. Taylor said, explaining why it did not take much for Mr. Trump to win coal country’s trust. “He mentions West Virginia, he mentions the coal workers, and that was pretty much all he had to do to seal this deal.” Now that the deal has been sealed, Mr. Trump has put a  climate change contrarian  and friend of the coal industry in charge of his Environmental Protection Agency transition team. His children’s drama teacher, Dusty Smith, 36, who has purple and blue streaks in her hair, said she had voted for Mr. Trump because he seemed “very humble” on  “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”  At the Thanksgiving play Ms. Smith directed, an African-American teenager delivered a spoken-word homage to racial harmony.	27	2

Hatch , the veteran lawmaker who currently holds the Utah seat, to seek an eighth term in large part to block Mr. Romney’s path. “I’m not always with the president on what he might say or do, and if that happens, I’ll call them like I see them, the way I have in the past,” Mr. Romney said at a party dinner in Provo, adding that he largely supports Mr. Trump’s domestic agenda and could work with the White House. In addition to Mr. Romney, Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, after heavy lobbying by Mr. McConnell and Mr. Trump, reversed himself and said on Friday that he would challenge Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat seeking re-election in a state that the president won by 36 points. “Joe thinks he can just kind of talk his way through all of this, but talk is really cheap when your record doesn’t meet the rhetoric,” Mr. McConnell said, noting Mr. Manchin’s opposition to a series of Republican measures, including the tax bill. “They thought it was going to be a political exercise.” While eager to trumpet the tax measure, Mr. McConnell said that “the single best thing we’ve done, in conjunction with the administration, are the court appointments,” including that of  Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court .	77	6
31 1 2018	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/arts/television/the-assassination-of-gianni-versace-american-crime-story-recap-a-random-killing.html	‘The Assassination of Gianni Versace’ Episode 3: Death or Disgrace?	8	3	1	 This episode, which lacks any Versace (Gianni or Donatella), felt to me like the freshest so far in “The Assassination of Gianni Versace,” the second season of “American Crime Story.” We are introduced to several new characters, chiefly Lee Miglin (Mike Farrell) and his wife, Marilyn Miglin (Judith Light). In another room, Lee takes a call from Andrew Cunanan, dialing from a pay phone, and when Marilyn asks who is calling, he lies and says it’s a business call. But I’m puzzled by the use of words like “husband” and “proposed.” They don’t seem true to my own memories of the late 1990s, when gay men were more likely to speak of boyfriends, partners and companions, and they seem strangely ahistoric. She offers a brisk inventory of what’s missing from the house — a Lexus, $2,000 in cash, two leather coats, two suits, “some inconsequential pieces of jewelry,” rare gold coins and a dozen pairs of socks — as she reaches the conclusion that the killing must have been a random and opportunistic robbery. Told by the Chicago police superintendent about the gay porn found next to the body, Marilyn surmises that “they must have belonged to the killer,” but goes on to say: “I’m not interested in his intentions. Find him, catch him, but don’t talk to me about what or might not be going through his mind.” She adds: “Dollars, jewelry, socks, suits — that’s all I’ll allow that man to steal from me. We worked too hard making that name, and we made it together.” For an ambitious woman born in the 1930s to have a husband who is fully supportive of her professional aspirations might indeed, as she suggests, have been “a fairy tale life.” “How many husbands believe in their wives’ dreams?” she asks her Home Shopping Network viewers — and us — later in the episode.	84	5

The Healthineers unit is among Siemens’ most profitable businesses, generating 13.8 billion euros, or about $16 billion, in revenue in the company’s 2017 fiscal year, which ended in September. Breakingviews columnist Liam Proud writes : The Justice Department  has argued  in its lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion Time Warner deal that putting together AT&T, which owns DirecTV and provides broadband internet service, and Time Warner, which owns HBO and Turner channels like TNT and CNN, puts too much power in one corporation.

31 5 2017	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/climate/trump-quits-paris-climate-accord.html	World Awaits Trump Decision on U.S. Future in Paris Accord	5	3	1	 Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, offered only that “I’m hearing from a lot of people, both ways,” and promised a decision “very soon.” With the world watching nervously, the feuding among the president’s aides further exposed the fault lines of a chaotic decision-making process that has swirled around Mr. Trump since he took office. Signs have been increasing for weeks that Mr. Trump was heading toward pulling out of the Paris agreement, apparently believing that a continued United States presence in the accord would harm the economy; hinder job creation in regions like Appalachia and the West, where his most ardent supporters live; and undermine his “America first” message. “And that’s not the kind of world we want to live in.” Foreign policy experts said the move could damage the United States’ credibility and weaken Mr. Trump’s efforts to negotiate issues far beyond climate change, like trade and terrorism. Speaking to a crowd of oil rig workers last year, Mr. Trump vowed to “cancel” the agreement, and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, has pushed the president to withdraw from the accord as part of an economic nationalism that has so far included pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade pact, and vowing to renegotiate Nafta. In a May 23 letter to Mr. Trump from Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia and nine other state attorneys general, Mr. Morrisey wrote, “Withdrawing from the Paris agreement is an important and necessary step toward reversing the harmful energy policies and unlawful overreach of the Obama era.” He added, “The Paris agreement is a symbol of the Obama administration’s ‘Washington knows best’ approach to governing.” Although the administration has been debating its position on the Paris agreement for months, the sentiment for leaving appears to have the upper hand over the views of Mr. Tillerson and Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and close adviser. During a telephone call in early May with President Emmanuel Macron of France, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Mr. Xi told the newly elected French leader that China and France “should protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement.” But the accord’s architects say the absence of the United States will inevitably weaken its chances of being enforced.	75	4
5 2 2018	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/style/liz-smith-memorial.html	Gossip From the Liz Smith Memorial, Just the Way She’d Want It	8	3	1	 People who are frustrated by what they know and don’t have a place to print.” Her favorite foods were fried, her favorite exercise was none, and when she dined at restaurants — which was pretty much all the time — she left inordinately large tips, saying, “no one ever got rich stiffing a waiter.” Although she never won a Pulitzer Prize, Mike Wallace once said she was more widely read (and better paid) than almost anyone who did. So when Ms. Smith was celebrated Friday afternoon at a memorial at the Majestic Theater in Midtown Manhattan on what would have been her 95th birthday, it made some sense that people who appeared regularly in her columns were not cheering her death  the way others had cheered Walter Winchell’s , but were instead tearing up on stage, talking about her as a friend, confidante and mentor. So much so, in fact, that by the time she died, there was an exit note left in her sofa with detailed instructions to friends that included the request (“in all caps,” Ms. McFadden noted) that they hold this posthumous event at a Shubert Theater. That excursion came to an end after the third oyster, when Ms. Stritch said, “this place is a dump,” grabbed everyone’s coats and took them to  3 Guys . So, Liz, it’s all your fault.” Other speakers included the actors Renée Zellweger (who described Ms. Smith traveling to Austin, Tex., in 2011, despite a hip injury, so she could accompany her to a film festival), Bruce Willis (who recalled Ms. Smith’s habit of using her column for charitable causes) and Holland Taylor (who met Ms. Smith back in the mid-’70s and received her last email from Ms. Smith around Nov. 5, a week before  her death ). Ms. Taylor alluded to that possibility from the stage, but said that what really endured between them was a friendship that “was for me the single safe harbor in what has always seemed a storm-tossed scattered life in, let’s not kid ourselves, the mean old world.” The writer Billy Norwich said he owed his name to Ms. Smith. “‘Honey,’” he recalled her telling him, “‘the first thing we need to do is get you a better name if you’re going to be a writer.’ I was born Billy Goldberg in Norwich, Conn., and one day over lunch I became Billy Norwich from Goldberg, Conn. Long before President Trump began calling CNN “fake news,” Ms. Stahl said he vowed to purchase The Daily News merely so he could fire Ms. Smith, who had written disparagingly about him during his divorce from Ivana Trump.	17	6

Investigators found no evidence to support his claims, but he is running for office in an era of nationwide voter credulity for conspiracy theories. “West Virginians know the facts, and the jury has spoken.” Mr. Blankenship was convicted of a misdemeanor count of conspiracy in 2015 after  the jury heard  that federal safety inspectors had written hundreds of safety violations for the Upper Big Branch mine, and former miners described unsafe conditions there. Gary and Patty Quarles, who are raising a grandson after their son, Gary Wayne Quarles, was killed at Upper Big Branch, described their anguish at watching Mr. Blankenship’s TV ads, titled “For the Sake of Coal Miners.” “We’re sitting here in our living room with our grandson, and there he sets up on TV — that’s sickening,” said Mr. Quarles, who also worked in Massey Energy coal mines.	7	2
3 6 2017	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/us/politics/republican-leaders-climate-change.html	How G.O.P. Leaders Came to View Climate Change as Fake Science	5	3	1	 It is difficult to reconcile the Republican Party of 2008 with the party of 2017, whose leader, President Trump, has called global warming a hoax, reversed environmental policies that Mr. McCain advocated on his run for the White House, and this past week announced that he would  take the nation out of the Paris climate accord , which was to bind the globe in an effort to halt the planet’s warming. “But the entire climate change debate has now been caught up in the broader polarization of American politics.” “In some ways,” he added, “it’s become yet another of the long list of litmus test issues that determine whether or not you’re a good Republican.” Since Mr. McCain ran for president on climate credentials that were stronger than his opponent Barack Obama’s, the scientific evidence linking greenhouse gases from fossil fuels to the dangerous warming of the planet has grown stronger. Government rules intended to slow climate change are “making people’s lives worse rather than better,” Charles Koch explained in a rare  interview last year  with Fortune, arguing that despite the costs, these efforts would make “very little difference in the future on what the temperature or the weather will be.” Republican leadership has also been dominated by lawmakers whose constituents were genuinely threatened by policies that would raise the cost of burning fossil fuels,  especially coal . Beyond the White House, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Science Committee, held a  hearing this spring  aimed at debunking climate science, calling the global scientific consensus “exaggerations, personal agendas and questionable predictions.” A small core of Republican lawmakers — most of whom are from swing districts and are at risk of losing their seats next year — are taking modest steps like introducing a  nonbinding resolution in the House  in March urging Congress to accept the risks presented by climate change. “It told Republicans that we were serious,” Mr. Phillips said, “that we would spend some serious money against them.” By the time Election Day 2010 arrived, 165 congressional members and candidates had signed Americans for Prosperity’s “ No Climate Tax” pledge . That same day, Mr. Morrissey would step outside the hotel  to announce  that he and other attorneys general would sue in federal court to try to stop the Clean Power Plan, which he called “the most far-reaching energy regulation in this nation’s history, drawn up by radical bureaucrats.” Mr. Pruitt  quickly beca me  a national point person for industry-backed groups and a magnet for millions of dollars of campaign contributions, as the fossil fuel lobby looked for a fresh face with conservative credentials and ties to the evangelical community. “Pruitt was instrumental — he and A.G. Morrisey,” said Thomas Pyle,  a former lobbyist  for Koch Industries, an adviser to Mr. Trump’s transition team and the president of a pro-fossil fuel Washington research organization, the Institute for Energy Research. Mr. Trump had, in 2012,  said on Twitter , “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” But he had also, in 2009, joined dozens of other business leaders to sign  a full-page ad  in the The New York Times urging Mr. Obama to push a global climate change pact being negotiated in Copenhagen, and to “strengthen and pass United States legislation” to tackle climate change. Hillary Clinton did not help her cause when she  said last spring  that her climate policies would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” In May 2016, Mr. Trump  addressed one of the largest rallies of his campaign : an estimated crowd of over 10,000 in Charleston, W.Va., where the front rows were crammed with mine workers. “The coal miners were the perfect case for what he was talking about,” Mr. Bennett said, “the idea that for the government in Washington, it’s all right for these people to suffer for the greater good — that federal power is more important than your little lives.” Mr. Trump took on as an informal campaign adviser Robert E. Murray — chief executive of the same coal company that had been working closely for years with the Republican attorneys general to unwind the Obama environmental legacy.	18	4

Heads to Coal Country to Hear Views on an Obama Climate Rule	5	3	1	 President Trump named Mr. Pruitt head of the E.P.A., where he has made it a top priority to reverse what he has called the Obama administration’s “war on coal.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt, like many other administration officials, question the overwhelming scientific evidence that climate change is mainly caused by human activity — a conclusion repeated this month  by the government’s own scientists  in 13 federal agencies. As part of a broad effort to uproot the environmental policies of the Obama administration, Mr. Pruitt announced in October that he would kill the Clean Power Plan, which he said did not follow regulatory norms and imposed undue burdens on states and energy producers. Holding the hearing in West Virginia “is like holding the only hearing on financial deregulation at the Wall Street Hilton — it does not denote a keen interest in alternative views,”  Michael B. Gerrard , the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said in an interview last week. During the morning hearing,  Patrick Morrisey , the attorney general of West Virginia, led off the speakers, saying that the power plan “is not only unlawful, but it’s bad policy as well.” He led the coalition of states that sued to stop the power plan. Robert E. Murray , founder and president of Murray Energy, a major coal producer, exulted, “In President Trump, we finally have a president who has vowed to preserve coal jobs.” The Obama administration’s rule, which he called the “so-called and illegal Clean Power Plan, better known as the no-power plan,” would impose “massive costs on the power sector and American consumers” while eliminating even more coal jobs. “The Clean Power Plan has a lot of support,” said Bill Price, a local organizer for the Sierra Club who grew up in the area and whose father worked in the coal mines. Since the shift to power sources like solar and wind create jobs and clean the environment, he said, the Clean Power Plan is “pro-worker, pro-economy and it’s pro-environment.” Some of the speakers marveled at the turnaround on environmental regulation that a change in administrations had wrought. “The reality is that  the coal industry has been in decline for many years .” Liz Perera , climate policy director of the Sierra Club, testified that the Trump administration had “inappropriately  cooked the books ” on the costs and benefits of the plan. Now 71 and afflicted with black lung and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, he called repealing the plan “immoral and indefensible.” He repeated a comment he gave in support of the plan in 2014: “We’re dying, literally dying, for you to help us.” Coal-fired power plants are a major source of greenhouse gases: they produce  about one-third  of the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions.	7	1

Trump was in West Virginia to showcase the benefits of Republican tax cuts, but he took a big and meandering detour to talk about his tough immigration and trade plans. In recent weeks, Trump has been pushing back more against the restraints of the office to offer more unvarnished opinions and take policy moves that some aides were trying to forestall. His remarks in West Virginia, like so many of his previous planned policy speeches, quickly came instead to resemble one of his free-wheeling rallies. They would have taken about two minutes,"" Trump said as he tossed his script into the air. As he has done before, Trump conjured images of violence and suffering when he described the perils of illegal immigration, though statistics show that immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than citizens. ""MS-13 is emblematic of evil, and we're getting them out by the hundreds,"" said Trump, who sat on stage at a long table in a gym draped in American flags and decorated with signs that read ""USA open for business."" ''This is the kind of stuff and crap we are allowing in our country, and we can't do it anymore."" Invoking the lines of his June 2015 campaign kickoff speech, in which he suggested that some Mexican immigrants were rapists, the president mused about the threat of violence among immigrants and appeared to make reference to a caravan of migrants that had been working its way north through Mexico toward the United States. Trump also defended his proposed tariff plan, which many of his fellow Republicans fear will start a trade war with China. He criticized West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who has expressed openness to working with the White House, for opposing the GOP tax plan. He praised attendees Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, both running in the Republican primary for Senate next month, suggesting an applause test between the two. Many members of his own party have blamed the president's lack of focus for helping to stymie their agenda, and they are eager for him to focus on the tax cut, the most significant legislation achievement on which to run in the upcoming midterm elections. While Trump went off script, the attendees —an assemblage of state politicians, local business owners, workers and families — stayed dutifully on task, talking about how the tax cuts have helped them. One woman, Jessica Hodge, tearfully told Trump: ""I just want to say thank you for the tax cuts."	88	4

If people don’t trust that their vote counts, then they won’t vote.” The round table on taxes was a lovefest for the president, in which attendees took turns praising him and recounting the ways in which the tax measure and Mr. Trump’s agenda had helped them and their families. “Your policies really have made an incredible difference in our state,” he said, adding, “We had the bull’s-eye on us until you got here, so thank you for that.” As he wrapped up the event, Mr. Trump asked the audience to weigh in on which man should win the primary next month.	92	6

The day after the crash, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II issued an advisory opinion concluding that police have authority to inquire into the immigration status of any person stopped or arrested, similar to the Arizona immigration law that is under federal court review. In those cases, ICE considers the likelihood that the person will be a danger to the community and the likelihood the person will appear at deportation hearings, said David Leopold, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.	28	4

State Lawmakers Fuel Immigration Debate	12	2	2	" ADVERTISEMENT Virginia, one of nearly 20 states toying with the idea of an Arizona-style immigration law, hurtled onto the national radar screen this week after Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli ruled that police can ask people about their immigration status during routine stops. While a northern Virginia county has been at the forefront of the push for stricter local immigration laws for three years, none of this activity has prompted the kind of nationwide backlash -- in the form of boycotts and a federal government lawsuit -- that Arizona triggered with its law in April. Those behind the Virginia proposals, including a proposed statewide law, are hoping their state can avoid the kind of public relations and legal pitfalls that have, at least temporarily, ensnared Arizona. It's both constitutional and prudent,"" said Robert Marshall, the Republican state delegate who originally requested the ruling from Cuccinelli, who is also a Republican. said the governor is reviewing her state's law to see if it can be refined in light of the court decision blocking key parts of it, but was not sure whether she was considering the possibility of making immigration checks discretionary as opposed to mandatory. Though Cuccinelli's ruling drew widespread attention, it's unclear how much direct impact it will have on Virginia law enforcement. Virginia Senate Majority Leader Richard Saslaw, a Democrat, said most police forces won't change their policies in light of the opinion. Saslaw noted that per Cuccinelli's opinion, state officers are still advised against arresting anyone for a civil immigration offense. Saslaw said he doesn't see Virginia, a non-border state, becoming a focal point of the immigration debate any time soon, and he rejected the idea that McDonnell could issue an order codifying Cuccinelli's ruling. Regardless of how Cuccinelli's ruling is interpreted, a few Virginia lawmakers are pushing hard to keep their state in the middle of the immigration furor. Board of County Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart seized on the incident, as he continued to push a proposed immigration law similar to Arizona's."	31	7

""I want the Obama administration to come clean with the American people about its policy of releasing illegal aliens who localities and other law enforcement officials have identified as illegal aliens who have committed crimes, and the Obama administration is simply turning around and releasing these dangerous individuals back into neighborhoods,"" Stewart said. Stewart said he'd like to see Congress and the president fund facilities to hold illegal immigrants suspected of other crimes in jails throughout their trial phase, and if found guilty, have the illegal immigrant serve time and then be ""deported immediately, not released on his own recognizance like they did here and thousands of other cases across the  ."	6	1

Police say Montano, who is from  , was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement after at least one arrest, and a prosecutor said he knew of at least one other occasion he'd been referred to immigration officials. Prince William County's top elected leader and a Kentucky congressman, both Republicans, criticized federal immigration officials for not deporting Montano.

ICE could not provide a breakdown of what's happened to the 2,064 convicted criminals and fugitives swept up in prior Cross Check arrests.

Leopold cited three main objectives: help Democrats win more races in the next few election cycles to “put them in a better situation before redistricting in 2020,” embark on legal efforts to “undo some of the more egregious redistricting” after the 2010 Census and push ballot initiatives that will lead to “fair maps.” He described the NDRC as a “super group” that brings together the efforts of the Democratic Governors Association, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee and House Majority PAC. Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee spokeswoman Carolyn Fiddler told Fox News that the Democrats’ recent efforts are a “smart refocus of efforts,” more than a reckoning and that related fundraising has been “astronomical.” She also said Trump’s victory has indeed sparked a lot of interest -- from potential canvassers to candidates.	74	1

ADVERTISEMENT Corey Stewart, chairman of the   County Board of Supervisors, is gearing up for a lawsuit over immigration documents for the second time this year. His county filed a lawsuit in March to obtain documents about an illegal immigrant charged last year with killing a nun in an drunken driving crash. Officials want more detailed information about the 3,800 illegal immigrants turned over to federal immigration agents since 2007. Stewart told FoxNews.com that since the county started turning over those prisoners, 380 have been re-arrested in Prince William County and turned over again. ""Ten percent -- that's an amazing number, because those are just those individuals who came back into the community, committed another crime and got re-arrested for that crime,"" Stewart said, speculating that the actual number of those released is ""a lot higher than 10 percent."" He said the Department of Homeland Security gave the county some information on those prisoners after an information request was filed last fall, but he described that file as incomplete. The administration on Tuesday announced that federal agents in May swept up 2,400 illegal immigrants in what was described as the largest operation of its kind. Stewart's county since last year has been the scene of two deadly incidents involving illegal immigrants with prior records in the U.S. Months after the high-profile crash that killed a nun in Prince William County, another illegal immigrant was arrested in February and charged in a killing spree that left three dead and three wounded. Stewart's county has since received DHS documents regarding the suspect in the nun's death, but has not yet dropped its lawsuit."	40	4

We are joined by a special local panel to talk about the issues that are important here in this swing county inside a swing state, really the Commonwealth of Virginia. We welcome Bob Lewis with the Associated Press, Julian Walker, The Virginian Pilot, David Sherfinski with the Washington Times. BOB LEWIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, it's got a -- it's just a diverse population. So you have a crucible here that, I think is sort of a bellwether for which way Virginia's going to go. BAIER: Julian, in a lot of places the economy drives the day, I'm sure that's the case here. JULIAN WALKER, VIRGINIAN PILOT NEWSPAPER: Well one of the ones in Prince William, in this swing county, is immigration, where this county in fact several years ago had a local ordinance which essentially became kind of a model for the law that Arizona passed in order to allow local law enforcement to check the immigration status – the lawful presence or lack thereof -- of folks who were stopped in this county, detained by law enforcement for one reason or another. In fact one of the candidates for statewide office next year, for lieutenant governor, Corey Stewart, who is now on the local board of supervisors here, he was kind of the architect behind that, the spearhead of that effort. DAVID SHERFINSKI, WASHINGTON TIMES: Absolutely, especially in the wake of the attention that immigration has gotten at the U.S. Supreme Court. BAIER: It's interesting that there are a lot of federal workers in this area, it's a bit further from Washington D.C. (CROSSTALK) BAIER: But there's a lot of commuters. LEWIS: Well, if the federal government finally does actually cut back. But what you've got here are people who -- there is more private industry here, there's more private sector going on here than people realize. BAIER: When the Obama campaign though looks at this county, Julian, they probably look to 2008 where he carried it with 58 percent of the vote. SHERFINSKI: Oh absolutely, I mean, especially with a high stakes U.S. senate election between Tim Kaine and George Allen already reserving millions of dollars in air time in the costly Washington D.C. suburbs, this is -- this along with the Richmond area and the Hampton Roads areas, what's known as kind of the ""urban crescent"" or the ""golden crescent"" in Virginia where there are just so many voters to be had by each side. Southside, in rural Virginia, in Martinsville, Pittsylvania County, Henry County, you've got horrible unemployment. But David just mentioned, people in Virginia aren't used to an ad war like we're seeing here now already."	39	3

""This executive order ensures public safety by ensuring that our police resources are deployed wisely and our immigrant communities feel safe cooperating with those who are sworn to protect them,"" Gray said in a statement. ""If they are afraid to cooperate with authorities on criminal investigations because they fear it might endanger their presence in the   or the presence of a loved one, then it endangers their public safety and that of our entire city."" Although district officials say the order only confirms a longstanding policy, critics still blasted the move. ""This is an abomination,"" said Corey Stewart, the Republican chairman-at-large of   County of Virginia, which is about 25 miles south of D.C. Stewart's county has sued the Department of Homeland Security twice, seeking information on 4,000 illegal immigrants that the county has arrested and turned over to Homeland Security for deportation. ""This is the capital of the United States,"" Stewart told FoxNews.com, ""and to have the nation's capital as a sanctuary city where essentially federal law is not going to be enforced sends all the wrong messages -- not just in the United States but around the world."" The term ""sanctuary city"" is used to describe places where local officials refuse to enforce federal immigration laws and undocumented workers are free to seek jobs, housing or local government services without fear of deportation unless targeted by federal agencies. Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Paul Quander said the order does not mean the district is opting out of a mandatory federal program called Secure Communities, which directs local agencies to share fingerprints collected from people in local jails with the Department of  . In signing the order, Gray said he wanted to clarify that the local police in district are not in the business of enforcing federal immigration laws."	76	3

I think problem number one is that as he gets into his first 100 days he's going to want to pass this trillion dollar transportation or infrastructure bill, which I think is a great idea if done correctly. MACCALLUM: Well, Representative Duffy, I thought it was interesting in the interview that Donald Trump did today, he said, I would like to be judge on my presidency starting now. But what's interesting is -- just one second, only 28 percent of Americans want Democrats to oppose Donald Trump, and Republicans in congress, they actually want them to work with us to secure the border, fix healthcare, and grow the economy, which is really remarkable for Democrats to have this push on their own side and say work together and get some of these big initiatives done.

We are joined by a special local panel to talk about the issues that are important here in this swing county inside a swing state, really the Commonwealth of Virginia. We welcome Bob Lewis with the Associated Press, Julian Walker, The Virginian Pilot, David Sherfinski with the Washington Times. BOB LEWIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, it's got a -- it's just a diverse population. So you have a crucible here that, I think is sort of a bellwether for which way Virginia's going to go. BAIER: Julian, in a lot of places the economy drives the day, I'm sure that's the case here. JULIAN WALKER, VIRGINIAN PILOT NEWSPAPER: Well one of the ones in Prince William, in this swing county, is immigration, where this county in fact several years ago had a local ordinance which essentially became kind of a model for the law that Arizona passed in order to allow local law enforcement to check the immigration status – the lawful presence or lack thereof -- of folks who were stopped in this county, detained by law enforcement for one reason or another. In fact one of the candidates for statewide office next year, for lieutenant governor, Corey Stewart, who is now on the local board of supervisors here, he was kind of the architect behind that, the spearhead of that effort. DAVID SHERFINSKI, WASHINGTON TIMES: Absolutely, especially in the wake of the attention that immigration has gotten at the U.S. Supreme Court. BAIER: It's interesting that there are a lot of federal workers in this area, it's a bit further from Washington D.C. (CROSSTALK) BAIER: But there's a lot of commuters. LEWIS: Well, if the federal government finally does actually cut back. But what you've got here are people who -- there is more private industry here, there's more private sector going on here than people realize. BAIER: When the Obama campaign though looks at this county, Julian, they probably look to 2008 where he carried it with 58 percent of the vote. SHERFINSKI: Oh absolutely, I mean, especially with a high stakes U.S. senate election between Tim Kaine and George Allen already reserving millions of dollars in air time in the costly Washington D.C. suburbs, this is -- this along with the Richmond area and the Hampton Roads areas, what's known as kind of the ""urban crescent"" or the ""golden crescent"" in Virginia where there are just so many voters to be had by each side. Southside, in rural Virginia, in Martinsville, Pittsylvania County, Henry County, you've got horrible unemployment. But David just mentioned, people in Virginia aren't used to an ad war like we're seeing here now already."	25	7
18 02 2011	http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/02/16/virginia-lawmaker-likely-sue-dhs-illegal-immigrant-data-killing.html	Virginia Lawmaker 'Likely' to Sue DHS Over Illegal Immigrant Data After Killing	12	2	2	" A suburban Virginia councilman is threatening to sue the Department of Homeland Security to obtain status reports on illegal immigrants delivered by his county into federal custody after an illegal immigrant in his community was charged in a triple homicide last week. Corey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, said he wants Congress to intervene on his county's behalf to subpoena information on 3,000 illegal immigrants handed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement since the county started enforcing immigration law in 2008 under a joint local-federal program. If federal officials don’t respond, “it’s likely” the county will file suit, Stewart said. ""You've got this tragic repetition of an illegal immigrant who at one point was in federal custody ... and comes out and commits a serious crime,"" Stewart told FoxNews.com. The board’s latest move follows a Freedom of Information Act request filed last year to compel DHS to release the information on illegals delivered through the 287(g) program, which authorizes law enforcement officials in the county to check the immigration status of suspects and turn over to federal authorities anybody found to be in the country illegally. Stewart said despite the supposed partnership, county police tell him ""anecdotally"" that they're seeing the same illegal immigrants back on the streets after handing them over to federal immigration officials. In the case of Reyes-Alfaro, a federal immigration judge ordered him deported in 2002 after he was caught by Border Patrol trying to enter the country illegally the year before. Stewart said both arrests occurred before the county had implemented 287(g), so nobody checked his immigration status. As the board deals with the latest case, the county has also filed another request seeking information about Carlos Martinelly-Montano, an illegal immigrant who last August was charged with killing a nun in an alleged drunk-driving crash. The administration refused to turn over documents pertaining to Montano, he said, and delivered a ""data dump of useless information"" about the other illegal immigrants."	55	1

On the eve of the Democratic convention, we speak with Hillary Clinton’s chief strategist, and Donald Trump's campaign chairman. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I just can't think of anybody better to have by my side. SEN. TIM KAINE, D-PRESUMPTIVE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Let's go make history and elect Hillary Clinton, the 45th president of the United States. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE:  You are looking live at the Wells Fargo Center, home of the Philadelphia Flyers and the 76ers, and this week, site of the Democratic convention. BENENSON:  Well, I think Hillary Clinton made it clear from the beginning her number one priority was to pick a vice-president who was ready to do all parts of the job of president. WALLACE:  But there are some real differences on issues between Clinton and Kaine, and I want to go through them. WALLACE:  Kaine praised TPP, the Pacific trade deal, Clinton opposes it. BENENSON:  Look, but Hillary Clinton said they were things she liked about it too along the way. WALLACE:  All right, let's talk about the other big issue as we get into the convention, and I suspect you know what I’m going to talk about. Some Bernie Sanders supporters upset about Kaine because they think he is too centrist, but what they're really upset about was a WikiLeaks release on Friday of thousands of DNC e-mails which seem to show that the DNC was favoring Clinton over Sanders. As for the other things, you know, first of all, I believe the gentleman who sent that e-mail has apologized -- WALLACE:  The one about Sanders’ religion. BENENSON:  I think the DNC will conduct a full review of all these emails, all these emails that were being apparently selectively leaked by these actors acting in concert with Russia, that’s a serious problem that we have to be concerned with, if they’re trying to meddle in what we believe was a fair and honest election. I think there’s no question -- WALLACE:  You think this is Russia trying -- BENENSON:  I think when 30 million people vote through the primary system, a near historic number, the second most in history and the ballots were counted at the ballot box, and Hillary Clinton got 16 million votes, the third highest total in history, second only to herself and Barack Obama. I think that we should wait for the review, the full review of this, and not jump to any conclusions on any sides based -- WALLACE:  Well, the fact that the finance chair has apologized, to indicate that was an accurate e-mail. WALLACE:  Let me just say, incidentally, and we were assured by the DNC that we wouldn't have what happened last week at the RNC, that they wouldn't do sound checks, but every convention we've done, they do sound checks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:  This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. BENENSON:  Well, honestly, we haven't polled during his convention --   WALLACE:  OK. BENENSON:  -- because it’s not an opportune time to do that. WALLACE:  Up next, the chair of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, and whether his candidate will see a post-convention bounce, as ""Fox News Sunday"" reports live from the Democratic Convention inside Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON:  When he said as he did say, ""I alone can fix it"", he is not only wrong, he is dangerously wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  Paul, their basic message, Trump doesn't care about regular folks. PAUL MANAFORT, TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN:  Well, that's the pot calling the kettle black I guess you could say. But more importantly, as far as we're concerned, the people who voted for Bernie Sanders, right now, you've got polls out showing less than 55 percent are going to support Hillary Clinton. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn't really jive with the experience of most people. WALLACE:  Well, let's drill down on one area -- here is what Trump said about Clinton's call for a 550 percent increase in the number of Syrian refugees we let into the country. We're confident that after the conventions, you're going to see continued growth in our direction, but more importantly, in the states that are going to elect Donald Trump, we've seen them move in and I’m sure we're going to see more. It’s the opposite this year and we're comfortable coming out of our convention, we’re -- again, the CNN polls that over 75 percent who were watching agreed with Donald Trump and thought he could bring about the change. The convention itself communicated what we wanted, and we think that Democrats are going to have problems keeping their coalition together, because the establishment is trying to abuse the progressives and their party, and they're the ones in chaos. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE:  Up next, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine make their debut on the Democratic ticket. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  Hillary Clinton on why she selected her running mate, Tim Kaine, during their first joint appearance yesterday in Miami. I think the Clinton campaign certainly thinks he is in pretty good shape, which explains the fact that they didn't really trout out the Kaine announcement in such a way as to try to step on Donald Trump's convention bounce, because it seems to be that he didn't or will not get much of a bounce. WALLACE:  As we discussed with Joel Benenson, there is another big story on the eve of this convention, and that's the leak of thousands of DNC, Democratic National Committee e-mails that seemed to confirm a lot of people’s suspicions that the DNC was working to help Hillary Clinton, at the expense of Bernie Sanders. AMY WALTER, ""THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT"":  I think, you know, when we came into the RNC, the question was how much disunity is there really, and what started out in Cleveland was some talk about the delegates erupting. WALLACE:  George, we always, I think, assumed that the DNC was working on behalf of Hillary Clinton and to the detriment of Bernie Sanders. GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  I don't think it will last for very long, but it does complicate her presentation at this convention. WALLACE:  We should point out, there was a meeting of the Rules Committee yesterday, they met for hours and hours and hours about the question of maybe there should be fewer super delegates, and more small D democratic in the sense that people -- the delegates on the floor have to be actually voted in by real people, by voters. This is fun and everything, but let's wait until we get to the next candidate -- WILL:  The Republicans think that perhaps they ought to have more super delegates. WALLACE:  All right, well, we're going to get to the Republicans in a moment. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  Donald Trump, pushing the central theme of his campaign, as he accepted the GOP nomination Thursday night in Cleveland, and we're back now with the panel. HUME:  Well, I think that the party is about as unified as it will get with Donald Trump as its nominee. WALTER:  That's right. WALLACE:  I mean, Clinton has engage in -- WALTER:  One hundred percent. WALLACE:  OK. WALTER:  But I think you're going to see a convention, this is at least what I'm hearing, this one is going to be much more focused on while taking out Trump, focusing on a much brighter, sunnier kind of optimistic message, and one that talks more about Hillary Clinton, while also taking on Donald Trump. WALTER:  That's right. WILL:  Well, Donald Trump is the one who was described contemporary America as a ""hell hole,"" that's a quote. GEARAN:  That's going to be a powerful argument for Trump, just because this would be the third Democratic administration in a row, and it has been Hillary Clinton's bet that it is far better to wrap herself in Barack Obama than to run away from him. As the Democrats seek to portray this as a good idea to elect the Democrats as a third time, they have to be careful not to acknowledge that a lot of people do not think things are going well and they're really not looking for continuity, they're looking for change."	37	4
9 4 2018	https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/09/us/politics/09reuters-oklahoma-education.html	Oklahoma Teachers Press Lawmakers for Tax Plan to End Strike	3	3	2	" OKLAHOMA CITY —  Thousands of Oklahoma teachers packed the state Capitol on Monday to press the Republican-dominated legislature to enact a capital gains tax overhaul that educators said could help end a statewide walkout now in its second week. During a rally filled with live music and speeches, the teachers called for increased spending for an education system where inflation-adjusted funding per student dropped by 28.2 percent between 2008 and 2018, the biggest reduction of any state, according to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""We are asking them to fully fund the future and create sustained revenue,"" said Jenni Morrison, 37, a teacher from Edmond who has been at the Capitol every day since the strike began on April 2. Public schools serving about 500,000 of the state's 700,000 students were closed on Monday. That includes Oklahoma City and Tulsa, which said they would close again on Tuesday. Organizers said Monday's protest could be the largest since the walkout began, drawing as many as 40,000 people. Since late March, lawmakers have approved nearly $450 million in new taxes and revenue to help fund teachers' pay and education, but that is still short of the $600 million being sought by teachers. Lawmakers on Monday discussed a bill that would remove a tax exemption on capital gains and bring in about $100 million. If enacted, the union has said it would be a major step toward ending the strike. They also want lawmakers to implement a hotel tax that would bring in an estimated $50 million. The strike has garnered strong public backing, with a statewide survey from Sooner Poll last Friday showing that 72.1 percent of respondents supported the walkout. Educators in other states, increasingly angry over stagnating wages, are also considering walkouts. Opponents of the Oklahoma tax hikes said lawmakers could bolster education spending by cutting bureaucracy and waste rather than raising taxes. The new taxes and revenue approved by lawmakers translate into an average teacher pay raise of about $6,100. Teachers are seeking a $10,000 raise over three years. The minimum salary for a first-year teacher is currently $31,600, state data shows."	86	7

Spoiler: They Did Not.	3	3	2	 It seemed as though Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the creators of HBO’s “Westworld,” had given up. So, like a soon-to-be-exiled employee insisting “You can’t fire me because I quit,”  they told their Reddit superfans on Monday  they would reveal the entire plot of the second season in a 25-minute video, released less than two weeks before its premiere on April 22. The theory: If all the plot details were known ahead of time, the community’s moderators could potentially squelch any open discussion of them, protecting the rest of the community from stumbling upon the truth. For those who chose to watch the video, spoilers wouldn’t drip out through questionable sources — they’d be confirmed, complete and present top-of-mind throughout the viewing experience. News sites   earnestly   dissected   the decision  to create the video and its implications, while Reddit commenters tied themselves in knots debating whether they’d watch. Evan Rachel Wood, who plays Dolores, appears and softly sings “We’re no strangers to love.” Savvy viewers start to put together what’s going on. The 10-year-old internet prank — tricking people into clicking on a video of the British singer Rick Astley’s 1987 hit song “Never Gonna Give You Up” — had its heyday but hasn’t been much of a thing for a while now. The song in the “Westworld” video is followed by 22 minutes of a dog sitting in front of a piano as the show’s theme plays on a loop. The misdirection also offered a look at how “Westworld” might interact with the rampant speculation on Reddit, where the line between theory and spoiler disintegrated as users predicted all of the major twists in the show’s first season. “When those theories have been taken out of a site like Reddit and put into headlines, that’s a bummer.” The video left the  “Westworld” community on Reddit  a very confusing place. Some of the commenters who hadn’t watched the video appeared to have no idea they had merely avoided a Rick Astley cover, while those who had seen it were delighted to be in on the joke.	101	6

Under the federal law Trump invoked in his proclamation calling for National Guard troops, governors who send troops retain command and control over their state's Guard members and the U.S. government picks up the cost. Trump said last week he wants to send 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard members to the border, issuing a proclamation citing ""the lawlessness that continues at our southern border.""

For example, we could become aware of a story that we want to monitor (and possibly cover) when a tweet from a local Houston reporter says something like, “Gunshots fired in Harris County Institute of the Forensic Sciences.” And then seconds later, another one from a different account says, “Whoa im in Houston and I think i just heard fireworks or maybe gunfire?? They’re often tweets that we might not otherwise have seen, because they come from, for example, a cloud computing consultant in Houston who has 43 followers on Twitter. I wouldn’t see that on Twitter for hours, but Dataminr would bring it to my attention right away. And I still sometimes web surf like an old, using an RSS reader (Feedly). For trending news, what we hope to do is put together patterns that others may not have, or to put a new spin on a story that’s already out there. I also use Twitter to follow the news, which sometimes helps me find patterns. (I can’t use Tweetdeck, and I’m always impressed that people are able to, by the way.) We also have a pretty active Slack culture on my team, and we get a lot of ideas (like  one by my teammate Maya Salam on showering ) just from talking about dumb things with one another, saying whether we prefer rice, bread or potatoes, that kind of thing. I use  Sennheiser headphones  when I want to listen to music closely, and those little Sony over-ear headphones (the ones that came with Discmen) for listening to music on the go. I thought they belonged to my roommate (someone had opened the outer layer of the box), but he told me they weren’t his. The over-ear headphones get blown out kind of easily, but you can order replacements on Amazon and they are super cheap. There is now so much tech out there — tweets, Facebook posts, phone notifications and more — to distract us. I  deleted Facebook from my phone  last year, so that’s gone. I don’t have any magic tricks or anything, though, and I get distracted pretty easily. And when I need to write something on deadline, I minimize Slack and put my stolen headphones on.	26	5

Primary Fights Worry Party Leaders	4	3	2	 “Any division in the Republican Party helps Donnelly.” The Indiana primary is among several, including those in West Virginia and Wisconsin, where Republicans are locked in nominating battles in states Mr. Trump won in 2016 and where the party has hoped to add to its slender two-seat majority. It’s happening and it’s intensifying.” He added, “All the opposition research will have been done for Joe Donnelly at that point.” Mr. Rokita said he had no concerns that the attacks would help the incumbent Democrat. And I want them to know about me.” Referring to two previous Republican presidential candidates, John R. Kasich and Mitt Romney, Mr. Rokita added: “Messer at this point is like all losing candidates, like Kasich or Romney, ‘if you beat up on me, we are all going to lose.’ Absolutely wrong. Mr. Rokita’s “elites” are something else to Mr. Grand: “People that know what’s good for the Republican Party, yes, longstanding Republicans, yes. People who know how to elect Republican candidates.” “Or,” he asked, does Mr. Rokita “want to go back to the group that gave us Mourdock?” That was a reference to Richard E. Mourdock, a candidate whose backing from Tea Party groups and national conservative organizations six years ago led to the  defeat of a   longtime incumbent Republican, Senator Richard G. Lugar , in the Indiana primary. That was a gift that kept on giving.” Mr. Braun dismissed Mr. Rokita as a “smash mouth.” “He’ll do and say things that might impress,” he said. “If he’s trying to act like Trump it’s kind of a poor impression.” He also said there could be lingering damage: “When you’ve got sharp elbows, that creates a long memory for the people hit by those elbows.” He rejected Mr. Rokita’s charge that he was a recent Republican convert, saying he had never voted for a Democrat for a federal office. Mr. Messer, whose campaign so far has been the most measured of the three, accused Mr. Rokita of “trying to make things up.” “It’s crazy,” Mr. Messer said.	40	1

Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: “President Trump’s continued waffling on whether to stay in or withdraw from the Paris Agreement made it impossible to reach consensus at the Taormina summit on the need for ambitious climate action. “There’s a situation where it’s six — if you count the European Union, seven — against one.” President Emmanuel Macron of France said he had told Mr. Trump it was “indispensable for the reputation of the United States and for the Americans themselves that the Americans remain committed” to the climate agreement. It says the United States is “in the process of reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics.” The president did not mention the impasse in his only public remarks after the summit meeting, to American troops at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily. He succeeded at busting norms, but not building good will.” The American national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, said that Mr. Trump’s participation in the ceremony was an implicit endorsement of Article 5. In a  message on Twitter  on Saturday, he said, “I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!” There is an intense debate inside the West Wing over whether to withdraw from the accord or to try to renegotiate its terms, pitting hard-line nationalists, like Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist, against more mainstream advisers like Mr. Cohn. On Thursday, Mr. Cohn told reporters that Mr. Trump’s thinking on the subject was “evolving.” But other senior officials said that even if the United States remained in the agreement, it could effectively gut its principles. In a recent letter to Mr. Trump from 10 state attorneys general, West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, wrote, “Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement is an important and necessary step toward reversing the harmful energy policies and unlawful overreach of the Obama era.” On trade, Mr. Trump pushed his demand that any agreements negotiated by the United States must be fair. Shortly after Air Force One took off from Sicily for Washington, Mr. Trump  said on Twitter  that he had enjoyed “great” meetings on trade, saying, “We push for the removal of all trade-distorting practices....to foster a truly level playing field.”	62	1

In an interview at the start of the festival, Aix’s outgoing general director, Bernard Foccroulle, described his vision as one in which opera has “a vivid and creative relationship to the past, with a focus that is of our time.” The model should be one of “participation, not consumerism,” and he has sought to anchor the festival in larger artistic communities and to make connections with the broader Mediterranean world. Mr. Foccroulle’s approach was evident in the other work I saw at Aix, Bizet’s “ Carmen .” It’s opera’s ultimate golden oldie, but Dmitri Tcherniakov’s production, meticulously staged and performed with rare intensity, questions why we keep coming back to this story. I can’t, however, make the same promise of accessibility when it comes to Krzysztof Warlikowski’s production of Franz Schreker’s 1918 rarity, “ Die Gezeichneten ,” which had its premiere at the Bavarian State Opera the previous week. In Zurich, a revival of Andreas Homoki’s production of Wagner’s “ Lohengrin ” offered a very different model of what opera can be. Mr. Homoki’s rejection of allegory is unusual for “Lohengrin,” an opera whose questions of faith, trust and social cohesion have often lent themselves to fanciful interpretations, like Hans Neuenfels’s mouse-themed  production  for the Bayreuth Festival in Germany. It’s also noteworthy that all these productions featured prominent, and excellent, performances by American singers: As well as Ms. Naglestad, Mr. Jovanovich and Ms. Willis-Sorensen, the list also included Michael Fabiano in “Carmen,” and Paul Appleby and Julia Bullock in “Rake’s Progress.” You hope they will bring something from these adventurous and intense operatic experiments back home.	39	7

The Miro, entitled ''Personage and Birds'' and completed in 1970, is an angular, Tinkertoy-like construction in primary colors that sits below I. M. Pei's Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Bank Building), a granite tower, cut at the corners, at 600 Travis Street. From the Alley Theater to Anthony's, From the Rothko Chapel to Pennzoil Place: Where to Cool the Heels and Drench the Senses Here is information about Houston: Where to Stay THE LANCASTER HOTEL, 701 Texas Avenue, in the heart of the downtown theater (and concert and opera) district, was restored to its original 1920's elegance a few years ago; with a cheery, canary-yellow lobby and gleaming antiques in many of its 93 bedrooms, this is one of Houston's gems. You can sample Tex-Mex at the original Ninfa's, 2704 Navigation Street, (713) 228-1175, a Bush family favorite, where the skirt-steak fajitas are still made with care. You can try Tex-Tex at Mr. del Grande's terrific new self-service cafe, Taco Milagro, on Westheimer Road at 2255 Kirby Drive, (713) 522-1999, where the margaritas are unsweetened, the salsas are freshly made each day and the pork barbacoa enchiladas with milagro mole sauce will knock your socks off (if you're wearing any).

10 5 2016	https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/us/politics/west-virginia-primary-preview.html	Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton Court West Virginians Hit Hard by Coal’s Decline	2	3	2	 But what people here bring up is a comment she made about coal workers in March, when she said during a televised forum, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” She was talking about providing opportunity through clean energy, and she emphasized that coal miners must not be left behind, but the sound bite was a damning one. At a round-table event, Bo Copley, a 39-year-old father who had lost his job in the coal industry, told her, “I just want to know how you can say you’re going to put a lot of coal miners out of jobs and then come in here and tell us how you’re going to be our friend.” Mrs. Clinton called her comment a “misstatement” and expressed regret. “This is a ghost town, because when the coal goes out, it hurts all of us.” In the last quarter of 2011, West Virginia had about 24,700 coal mining jobs; by the last quarter of 2015, that number had fallen to about 14,500, a decline of more than 40 percent, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence.	47	5

8 9 2017	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/movies/fall-movie-releases-2017.html	Fall 2017 Movie Release Schedule	8	3	2	 EX LIBRIS — THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY  A tireless chronicler of American institutions, Frederick Wiseman, now 87, documents the inner workings of one of the world’s largest and most recognizable library systems, where even phone operators are handy with Middle English, and the photo file is so detailed that it contains a folder of “dogs in action.” AGAINST THE NIGHT  Among the places you might not want to go on late-night excursions with your friends, “abandoned prisons” rank roughly third, behind only “haunted abandoned prisons” and “haunted abandoned prisons once run by wardens who turned their inmates into biochemical test subjects.” AMERICAN ASSASSIN  A veteran C.I.A. EASY LIVING  Adam Keleman’s debut feature is not a remake of the Jean Arthur comedy classic from 1937, written by Preston Sturges, but it does concern old movies, or at least a door-to-door saleswoman (Caroline Dhavernas) who finds them inspirational. WOODPECKERS  At a prison in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, an inmate (Jean Jean) begins a clandestine, sign-language-enabled courtship with a prisoner (Judith Rodriguez Perez) in the nearby women’s penitentiary. THIRST STREET  An American flight attendant (Lindsay Burdge) has a fling with a Frenchman (Damien Bonnard), only to have his ex-girlfriend (Esther Garrel) turn up, in the latest psychological whirlwind from Nathan Silver (“Stinking Heaven”). Matthew Vaughn’s follow-up serves at least one good cause — keeping Julianne Moore employed, here as a villain — and also stars Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Channing Tatum, Colin Firth, Halle Berry and Elton John (?!). STRONGER  David Gordon Green, a long way from his indie roots (“George Washington,” “All the Real Girls”), dramatizes the true story of  Jeff Bauman  (Jake Gyllenhaal), who lost both of his legs in the Boston Marathon bombing. THE TIGER HUNTER  An Indian tiger hunter’s son (Danny Pudi, from “Community”), having emigrated to Chicago, puts on a charade to pretend he’s more successful than he is when the woman he loves pays a visit. Stephen Frears, already familiar with British royalty from “The Queen” (2006), chronicles the resulting friendship. I AM ANOTHER YOU  After meeting a man who is a drifter, seemingly by choice, in Florida, the Chinese documentarian Nanfu Wang (“Hooligan Sparrow”) followed him across the United States. FLATLINERS  Evidently none of the characters in this reimagining was cool enough to watch Joel Schumacher’s “Flatliners,” the 1990 hit that featured Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon as medical students who took turns stopping one another’s hearts. LITERALLY, RIGHT BEFORE AARON  It’s Adam (Justin Long) who was, literally or figuratively, the boyfriend right before Aaron (Ryan Hansen), the man Allison (Cobie Smulders), Adam’s ex, is about to marry. Peter Landesman (“Parkland,” which revolved around the John F. Kennedy assassination) directed. Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”) directed, and Harrison Ford returns as Deckard. This documentary, directed by David France (“How to Survive a Plague”), is “both a true-crime mystery and an elegy for the old West Village,” Mike Hale  wrote  in The New York Times when it screened at the Tribeca Film Festival. DEMENTIA 13  Sure, everything seems to be rebooted these days, but was anyone expecting a remake of the 1963 horror film “Dementia 13,” arguably Francis Ford Coppola’s first feature (discounting his apprentice work for Roger Corman and soft-core films)? EARTH: ONE AMAZING DAY  Richard Dale, Peter Webber and Fan Lixin directed this sequel to the 2009 nature documentary “Earth,” which Jeannette Catsoulis  described  in The Times as “nature defanged and declawed for kiddie consumption.” FACES PLACES  For her latest personal essay and travelogue in the vein of “The Gleaners and I,” the French new wave legend Agnès Varda has shared directing and M.C.-ing duties with the French street artist JR. Over the course of a road trip, as they reflect on French culture and camaraderie, he comes to seem like a natural successor to her sensibility. THE FLORIDA PROJECT  Sean Baker makes movies about “unseen” communities in plain sight: transgender prostitutes and cabdrivers in Los Angeles (“Tangerine”), say, or the world of pornographic filmmaking in “Starlet.” An unlikely crowd-pleaser, “The Florida Project” is centered on a seedy motel near Disney World, where Mr. Baker’s 6-year-old heroine (the exuberant Brooklynn Prince) lives jubilantly, despite poverty and squalid surroundings. THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN US  In a big change of pace, the Palestinian filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad (“Omar,” “Paradise Now”) directs Kate Winslet and Idris Elba in a survival picture. Ana de Armas also stars in the movie, which looks like a calculated appeal to fans of “The Fast and the Furious.” PARADISE  Andrei Konchalovsky (“Runaway Train”) directed this Holocaust story, shot in black and white, about a Russian woman in the French Resistance and a German officer she knows from before the war. IT  Stephen Gyllenhaal, Jake and Maggie’s father, directed this adaptation of Sarah Weeks’s  young-adult novel  about a 12-year-old (Talitha Bateman) who goes on a journey to discover why her mother knows fewer than two dozen words. TAKE EVERY WAVE: THE LIFE OF LAIRD HAMILTON   Mr. Hamilton , a titan of surfing, is profiled by the documentarian Rory Kennedy (“Last Days in Vietnam”). UNA  In a screen version of David Harrower’s play “Blackbird” — which ran Off Broadway with Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill and, a decade later, on Broadway with Mr. Daniels and Michelle Williams — Ben Mendelsohn and Rooney Mara play a middle-aged man and the woman with whom he had an illegal sexual relationship when she was a girl, who confronts him 15 years later. WALKING OUT  Alex and Andrew J. Smith (“The Slaughter Rule”), chroniclers of their native Montana, direct this lean survivalist film about a father and son (Matt Bomer and Josh Wiggins) whose rare time together turns harrowing after complications on a hunting trip. Bill Pullman appears in flashbacks, and Lily Gladstone (“Certain Women”) turns up briefly. 78/52: HITCHCOCK’S SHOWER SCENE  You might call Alexandre O. Philippe’s documentary a behind-the-scenes portrait — except that it’s more like a behind-the-scene portrait, a feature-length examination of the moment of Marion Crane’s death in “Psycho” from technical, historical and theoretical angles. THE DEPARTURE  Lana Wilson (a director of “After Tiller”) films a profile of Ittetsu Nemoto, an erstwhile punk rocker and Buddhist priest who offers support for the suicidal. It sounds like something out of David Lynch, but it’s an animated feature from Peter Lepeniotis (“The Nut Job”) and Shelly Shenoy. THE MEYEROWITZ STORIES (NEW AND SELECTED)  Dysfunctional families aren’t exactly new territory for Noah Baumbach, but this bittersweet and often just plain bitter comedy about three siblings (Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller and Elizabeth Marvel), healing old wounds and dealing with their cantankerous father (Dustin Hoffman), got a warm reception at Cannes in May. For that, Angela Robinson’s biopic tells the story of Wonder Woman’s creator, a psychologist who maintained a hidden life with his wife (Rebecca Hall) and their lover (Bella Heathcote). TE ATA  Q’orianka Kilcher (“The New World”) plays Mary Thompson Fisher, known as Te Ata, a Chickasaw performer whose celebrated career included appearances before Franklin D. Roosevelt. L’ENFANT SECRET  This 1979 film by Philippe Garrel (“I Can No Longer Hear the Guitar”) will receive its first run in the United States, following a showing at the New York Film Festival and a retrospective of that French auteur’s work at the Metrograph in New York. BPM (BEATS PER MINUTE)  Robin Campillo, a regular screenwriting collaborator of Laurent Cantet’s (“The Class”), took the Grand Prix at Cannes, the equivalent of second place, for this powerful look at AIDS activists in Paris in the early 1990s, with a focus on protests and strategy. Dean Devlin, a frequent writer and producer on Roland Emmerich’s movies (“Independence Day,” the 1998 “Godzilla”), orchestrates the mayhem. ONLY THE BRAVE  Josh Brolin stars as the leader of the Granite Mountain Hotshots — wildfire specialists called “the Seal Team 6 of firefighters” in the trailer — in a portrait of the group’s bravery, based on a GQ magazine article. ONE OF US  The documentarians Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady (“Detropia,” “Jesus Camp”) capture three years in the lives of three Hasidic New Yorkers who have left their ultra-Orthodox communities. WHERE’S THE MONEY  To retrieve stolen money, a black student (the comedian Andrew Bachelor) at the University of Southern California rushes a very white fraternity. ALL I SEE IS YOU  Pulling a gender swap on the Val Kilmer–Mira Sorvino vehicle “At First Sight,” this film from Marc Forster (“World War Z”) casts Blake Lively as a woman who, having been blinded in her youth, regains sight in one eye, thanks to an operation. In a cloistered Swiss village in 1971, a housewife (Marie Leuenberger) picks up the torch for women’s liberation; the movement she starts jolts the conservative populace. FÉLICITÉ  The filmmaker Alain Gomis, who will bring his first feature to the New York Film Festival this fall, directed this story of a singer (Véro Tshanda Beya Mputu) in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, who desperately needs money to pay for her injured son’s recovery. THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER  Winner of a screenwriting prize at Cannes, this warped blend of horror film and morality play from Yorgos Lanthimos (“The Lobster”) stars Colin Farrell as a cardiologist and Barry Keoghan (“Dunkirk”) as an ingratiating boy who knows something about his past. MR. ROOSEVELT  Noël Wells (“Master of None”) wrote, directed and stars in her debut feature, playing a comedian who returns from Los Angeles to Austin, Tex., and finds that her world there has changed. NOVITIATE  Maggie Betts directs this powerful film about a young woman (Margaret Qualley, from “The Leftovers”) who decides to become a nun after attending Roman Catholic school. THE SQUARE  “Force Majeure” already brought the Swedish director Ruben Ostlund international attention (especially after a  YouTube video , possibly tongue-in-cheek, showed him melting down while watching the Oscar nominations). BAD BLOOD THE MOVIE  Here’s a problem that Taylor Swift wouldn’t even try to solve: After an attack on a full-moon night, a college-age woman (Mary Malloy) turns into a vicious monster. ALONG FOR THE RIDE  When “Easy Rider” (1969) was a runaway success, Hollywood briefly believed that Dennis Hopper was a bankable director. Universal Pictures gave him a budget and the chance to make “The Last Movie” (1971), a fiasco by reputation that time has treated kindly. There has already been one documentary about its legendarily chaotic making, “The American Dreamer.” This one is based on anecdotes told to the director Nick Ebeling and covers some of Hopper’s later career as well. LAST FLAG FLYING  Set in 2003, the opening-night feature at this year’s New York Film Festival is said to be a riff on Hal Ashby’s “The Last Detail.” Richard Linklater directs Steve Carell, Laurence Fishburne and Bryan Cranston as old Vietnam War pals who travel together to bury Mr. Carell’s character’s son, killed in Iraq. Denzel Washington is the title character in this legal drama, written and directed by Dan Gilroy (“Nightcrawler”). BITCH  A housewife who’s been taken for granted (Marianna Palka, the movie’s writer and director) takes up residence in her house’s basement and begins behaving like a most un-housebroken dog. DADDY’S HOME 2  When we last saw Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell, they had buried the hatchet and found a way to split parenting duties (Mr. Ferrell’s character being married to Linda Cardellini, who plays the mother of Mr. Wahlberg’s children). INTENT TO DESTROY: DEATH, DENIAL & DEPICTION  The veteran documentarian Joe Berlinger (the “Paradise Lost” trilogy) chronicles the making of Terry George’s film  “The Promise,”  a rare large-scale production about the Armenian genocide. With Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts and Lucas Hedges (who gave a standout performance as Casey Affleck’s nephew in “Manchester by the Sea”). THELMA  Perhaps a return to form by the Norwegian director Joachim Trier — his last feature, the English-language  “Louder Than Bombs,”  met with a mixed reception from critics — “Thelma” centers on a repressed young woman (Eili Harboe) who leaves her remote hometown to study in Oslo. THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI  When she suspects that a police chief (Woody Harrelson) hasn’t done enough to solve her daughter’s murder, a mother (Frances McDormand) puts that message on three billboards — ticking off a sizable portion of the town. It’s a comedy, of the bleak variety that Martin McDonagh (“In Bruges”) usually makes. MUDBOUND  Widely acclaimed at Sundance, the new film from Dee Rees (“Pariah”) is a “they don’t make ’em like they used to” Hollywood-style epic that also tells its story in a way Hollywood never did: Set in the Mississippi Delta around World War II, the movie accords equal weight to the lives of a black sharecropping family (Mary J. Blige, Rob Morgan and Jason Mitchell) and white landowners (Carey Mulligan, Jason Clarke and Garrett Hedlund). (At least twice a year, it’s fair to expect a new movie about a filmmaker and his fumbling, soju-addled interactions with women.) “On the Beach at Night Alone,” one of three Hong features to have its premiere in 2017, is said to be even more private, a reflection on how the South Korean news media reacted to word of Mr. Hong’s relationship with his latest muse, Kim Min-hee, who plays an actress (of course), and who won a prize at the Berlin Film Festival for her performance in it. This science-fiction movie looks like it’s geared for fans of “District 9.” THE STAR  In this animated feature, the first Christmas is seen from the vantage points of a donkey (voiced by Steven Yeun) and other animals, who sound a lot like Keegan-Michael Key, Kelly Clarkson, Ving Rhames and Gabriel Iglesias. For this “reimagining,” Eli Roth (“Hostel”) directed and Joe Carnahan (“The Grey”) wrote the script, so expect an uptick in gore. THE MAN WHO INVENTED CHRISTMAS  Like “Finding Neverland” and “Goodbye Christopher Robin” (see above), “The Man Who Invented Christmas” seems predicated on the notion that most interesting underpinnings of any work of fiction are the autobiographical elements that inspired it. We’ll find out in his directorial debut, based on the true story of Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain), who was known for arranging secret poker games for well-heeled, sometimes famous players and was  named in an indictment  in 2013 for her role in a gambling ring. BOMBSHELL: THE HEDY LAMARR STORY  Ms. Lamarr scandalized filmgoers when she skinny-dipped in Gustav Machaty’s “Ecstasy” (1933), but this documentary argues that there was a much more consequential surprise in her career: She was an unheralded inventor. One of its actors, Greg Sestero, along with Tom Bissell, wrote an account of that film’s making, and now James Franco has turn that account into a movie, casting himself as Tommy Wiseau, the fiercely independent personality who willed “The Room” into being. THE OTHER SIDE OF HOPE  That’s the perfect title for a film by Aki Kaurismaki, the bleakly comic Finnish filmmaker of “Le Havre” and “The Man Without a Past.” He won best director at the Berlin Film Festival for this tale of a restaurant owner (Sakari Kuosmanen) who befriends a Syrian (Sherwan Haji) seeking asylum in Helsinki. FILM STARS DON’T DIE IN LIVERPOOL  Annette Bening channels Gloria Grahame, the glamorous,  scandalous  star of “In a Lonely Place,” in her twilight years in England (after the collapse of her marriage to her former stepson, Tony Ray). FERDINAND  “The Story of Ferdinand,” the 1936  children’s book  by Munro Leaf about a gentle bull who “liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers,” charges onto the screen in an animated feature from Carlos Saldanha (the “Ice Age” movies). STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI  “Last” is not a word in the “Star Wars” vocabulary, especially in an age when — as with Peter Cushing in 2016’s stand-alone episode, “Rogue One” — the actors no longer need to be alive to perform in the movie. When we left Rey (Daisy Ridley) in “The Force Awakens,” she was dangling a light saber at Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Rian Johnson (“Looper”) directed this installment, employing a  record-low  number of wipe transitions. Jean-Louis Trintignant (from Mr. Haneke’s “Amour”) is the head of a rich, venal family; Isabelle Huppert, a Haneke regular, is in the cast as well. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN  Well, this is a novelty act — or at least might have been before the success of “La La Land”: a modern, straight-to-screen musical, based on the rise of P. T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman). The songs are by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who collaborated on “La La Land.” UNTITLED PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON FILM  Relatively little is known about Paul Thomas Anderson’s first feature since “Inherent Vice” (2014), except that it reunites him with Daniel Day-Lewis — unforgettable in “There Will Be Blood” — and that it centers on a dressmaker who tailors for the crème de la crème of London in the 1950s.	46	3
7 11 2017	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/movies/hello-again-review.html	Review: ‘Hello Again,’ a Movie Musical Ode to Love and Lust Over Decades	8	3	2	 In recent years, the movie musical has struggled for its complete resurrection as a genre, in efforts ranging from the Hollywood high-flown ( “Into the Woods” ) to the modest and quirky (Jeffrey St. Jules’s little-seen  “Bang Bang Baby,”  from 2014). And now, somewhere between the two, lies  “Hello Again,”  Tom Gustafson’s florid adaptation of  Michael John LaChiusa’s  1993 Off Broadway show (itself based on Arthur Schnitzler’s “La Ronde”). And then it’s off to a coupling between a prostitute and a soldier in 1901; a tryst between a rich man (T. R. Knight) and a younger one on the Titanic; a 1920s affair in a movie theater involving an adulteress (Rumer Willis); a Greenwich Village disco hookup in the 1970s; and so on.	11	3

Trump , the Republican presidential nominee, lags badly in crucial swing states and  loses his grip on white male voters over all , he remains on solid ground here with  his promise  to “bring back coal.” The fact that his Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton,  said in March , “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” has helped, too. “Because those people out there don’t see you as a friend.” Days later, at a Trump rally in the state capital, Charleston, Mr. Copley received a standing ovation. “Trump is a break from the status quo, which promises the moon but doesn’t deliver.” He struck a chord across coal country, giving voice to the inchoate rage and impotence that has accompanied the near-collapse, in less than a decade, of a lucrative industry. Political fury in Mingo County focuses squarely on the Environmental Protection Agency and President Obama, who is seen as having started a “war on coal.” Issues of race and class bubble under the surface: Mingo County, population 27,000, is 97 percent white, and racial epithets that are taboo in much of America still ring out openly. Of the Confederate flag, he said, “That’s heritage, not hate.” Mr. Matney, who was in Williamson to play Pokémon Go with his girlfriend, is a linesman for a telecommunications company that, he said, is losing 500 customers a month.	72	3
28 11 2016	https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/donald-trump-coal-country.html	Trump’s Promises Will Be Hard to Keep, but Coal Country Has Faith	2	3	2	 WILLIAMSON, W.Va. — If a single moment captured coal country’s despair this year, it was when Bo Copley, a soft-spoken, out-of-work mine maintenance planner, fought tears as he asked Hillary Clinton how, having dismissed coal’s future in language that came back to haunt her, she could “come in here and tell us you’re going to be our friend.” That was in May. As Mr. Copley put it, “Coal is secondary to me.” It is difficult for outsiders to fathom how deeply faith and work are intertwined here, or the economic and psychological depression that sets in when an entire region loses the only livelihood many of its people have ever known. “We’re a forgotten people,” Ms. Taylor said, explaining why it did not take much for Mr. Trump to win coal country’s trust. “He mentions West Virginia, he mentions the coal workers, and that was pretty much all he had to do to seal this deal.” Now that the deal has been sealed, Mr. Trump has put a  climate change contrarian  and friend of the coal industry in charge of his Environmental Protection Agency transition team. His children’s drama teacher, Dusty Smith, 36, who has purple and blue streaks in her hair, said she had voted for Mr. Trump because he seemed “very humble” on  “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”  At the Thanksgiving play Ms. Smith directed, an African-American teenager delivered a spoken-word homage to racial harmony.	70	5

17 2 2018	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-midterms.html	Trump Should Get Behind Romney’s Candidacy, McConnell Says	1	3	2	 WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell said in an interview on Friday afternoon that President Trump should rally behind the Senate candidacy of Mitt Romney despite his blistering criticism in 2016, arguing that Mr. Romney’s potent bid was an illustration of the Republican Party’s improving fortunes entering a challenging midterm campaign. “I can’t imagine that he’s not,” Mr. McConnell said when asked whether Mr. Trump was comfortable with Mr. Romney, who on Friday  made official his long-expected candidacy  for a Senate seat from Utah. “We don’t want to lose the seat, and this looks like a pretty formidable candidate.” Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, said that Mr. Romney would enter the Senate with a stature similar to what Hillary Clinton brought as a junior senator. “The best way to think about that, and I told him this a couple of months ago, I said: ‘You’ll be a freshman like Hillary Clinton was,’” Mr. McConnell recalled. “He will come in here with a level of national identity and respect that will make him effective from Day 1.” His glowing appraisal stood in contrast to that of the White House, which  aggressively lobbied Senator Orrin G. Hatch , the veteran lawmaker who currently holds the Utah seat, to seek an eighth term in large part to block Mr. Romney’s path. “I’m not always with the president on what he might say or do, and if that happens, I’ll call them like I see them, the way I have in the past,” Mr. Romney said at a party dinner in Provo, adding that he largely supports Mr. Trump’s domestic agenda and could work with the White House. In addition to Mr. Romney, Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, after heavy lobbying by Mr. McConnell and Mr. Trump, reversed himself and said on Friday that he would challenge Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat seeking re-election in a state that the president won by 36 points. “Joe thinks he can just kind of talk his way through all of this, but talk is really cheap when your record doesn’t meet the rhetoric,” Mr. McConnell said, noting Mr. Manchin’s opposition to a series of Republican measures, including the tax bill. “They thought it was going to be a political exercise.” While eager to trumpet the tax measure, Mr. McConnell said that “the single best thing we’ve done, in conjunction with the administration, are the court appointments,” including that of  Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court .	91	7
31 1 2018	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/arts/television/the-assassination-of-gianni-versace-american-crime-story-recap-a-random-killing.html	‘The Assassination of Gianni Versace’ Episode 3: Death or Disgrace?	8	3	2	 This episode, which lacks any Versace (Gianni or Donatella), felt to me like the freshest so far in “The Assassination of Gianni Versace,” the second season of “American Crime Story.” We are introduced to several new characters, chiefly Lee Miglin (Mike Farrell) and his wife, Marilyn Miglin (Judith Light). In another room, Lee takes a call from Andrew Cunanan, dialing from a pay phone, and when Marilyn asks who is calling, he lies and says it’s a business call. But I’m puzzled by the use of words like “husband” and “proposed.” They don’t seem true to my own memories of the late 1990s, when gay men were more likely to speak of boyfriends, partners and companions, and they seem strangely ahistoric. She offers a brisk inventory of what’s missing from the house — a Lexus, $2,000 in cash, two leather coats, two suits, “some inconsequential pieces of jewelry,” rare gold coins and a dozen pairs of socks — as she reaches the conclusion that the killing must have been a random and opportunistic robbery. Told by the Chicago police superintendent about the gay porn found next to the body, Marilyn surmises that “they must have belonged to the killer,” but goes on to say: “I’m not interested in his intentions. Find him, catch him, but don’t talk to me about what or might not be going through his mind.” She adds: “Dollars, jewelry, socks, suits — that’s all I’ll allow that man to steal from me. We worked too hard making that name, and we made it together.” For an ambitious woman born in the 1930s to have a husband who is fully supportive of her professional aspirations might indeed, as she suggests, have been “a fairy tale life.” “How many husbands believe in their wives’ dreams?” she asks her Home Shopping Network viewers — and us — later in the episode.	29	4

The Healthineers unit is among Siemens’ most profitable businesses, generating 13.8 billion euros, or about $16 billion, in revenue in the company’s 2017 fiscal year, which ended in September. Breakingviews columnist Liam Proud writes : The Justice Department  has argued  in its lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion Time Warner deal that putting together AT&T, which owns DirecTV and provides broadband internet service, and Time Warner, which owns HBO and Turner channels like TNT and CNN, puts too much power in one corporation. Another key part of AT&T’s filing To show that it would not abuse any increase in power that buying Time Warner would afford, AT&T said that it had offered rival distributors the same sort of deal that the government allowed in the last big vertical media merger, Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal.

31 5 2017	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/climate/trump-quits-paris-climate-accord.html	World Awaits Trump Decision on U.S. Future in Paris Accord	5	3	2	 Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, offered only that “I’m hearing from a lot of people, both ways,” and promised a decision “very soon.” With the world watching nervously, the feuding among the president’s aides further exposed the fault lines of a chaotic decision-making process that has swirled around Mr. Trump since he took office. Signs have been increasing for weeks that Mr. Trump was heading toward pulling out of the Paris agreement, apparently believing that a continued United States presence in the accord would harm the economy; hinder job creation in regions like Appalachia and the West, where his most ardent supporters live; and undermine his “America first” message. “And that’s not the kind of world we want to live in.” Foreign policy experts said the move could damage the United States’ credibility and weaken Mr. Trump’s efforts to negotiate issues far beyond climate change, like trade and terrorism. Speaking to a crowd of oil rig workers last year, Mr. Trump vowed to “cancel” the agreement, and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, has pushed the president to withdraw from the accord as part of an economic nationalism that has so far included pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade pact, and vowing to renegotiate Nafta. In a May 23 letter to Mr. Trump from Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia and nine other state attorneys general, Mr. Morrisey wrote, “Withdrawing from the Paris agreement is an important and necessary step toward reversing the harmful energy policies and unlawful overreach of the Obama era.” He added, “The Paris agreement is a symbol of the Obama administration’s ‘Washington knows best’ approach to governing.” Although the administration has been debating its position on the Paris agreement for months, the sentiment for leaving appears to have the upper hand over the views of Mr. Tillerson and Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and close adviser. During a telephone call in early May with President Emmanuel Macron of France, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Mr. Xi told the newly elected French leader that China and France “should protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement.” But the accord’s architects say the absence of the United States will inevitably weaken its chances of being enforced.	39	1

So when Ms. Smith was celebrated Friday afternoon at a memorial at the Majestic Theater in Midtown Manhattan on what would have been her 95th birthday, it made some sense that people who appeared regularly in her columns were not cheering her death  the way others had cheered Walter Winchell’s , but were instead tearing up on stage, talking about her as a friend, confidante and mentor. So much so, in fact, that by the time she died, there was an exit note left in her sofa with detailed instructions to friends that included the request (“in all caps,” Ms. McFadden noted) that they hold this posthumous event at a Shubert Theater. That excursion came to an end after the third oyster, when Ms. Stritch said, “this place is a dump,” grabbed everyone’s coats and took them to  3 Guys . So, Liz, it’s all your fault.” Other speakers included the actors Renée Zellweger (who described Ms. Smith traveling to Austin, Tex., in 2011, despite a hip injury, so she could accompany her to a film festival), Bruce Willis (who recalled Ms. Smith’s habit of using her column for charitable causes) and Holland Taylor (who met Ms. Smith back in the mid-’70s and received her last email from Ms. Smith around Nov. 5, a week before  her death ). Ms. Taylor alluded to that possibility from the stage, but said that what really endured between them was a friendship that “was for me the single safe harbor in what has always seemed a storm-tossed scattered life in, let’s not kid ourselves, the mean old world.” The writer Billy Norwich said he owed his name to Ms. Smith. “‘Honey,’” he recalled her telling him, “‘the first thing we need to do is get you a better name if you’re going to be a writer.’ I was born Billy Goldberg in Norwich, Conn., and one day over lunch I became Billy Norwich from Goldberg, Conn. Long before President Trump began calling CNN “fake news,” Ms. Stahl said he vowed to purchase The Daily News merely so he could fire Ms. Smith, who had written disparagingly about him during his divorce from Ivana Trump.	59	4

Investigators found no evidence to support his claims, but he is running for office in an era of nationwide voter credulity for conspiracy theories. “West Virginians know the facts, and the jury has spoken.” Mr. Blankenship was convicted of a misdemeanor count of conspiracy in 2015 after  the jury heard  that federal safety inspectors had written hundreds of safety violations for the Upper Big Branch mine, and former miners described unsafe conditions there. Gary and Patty Quarles, who are raising a grandson after their son, Gary Wayne Quarles, was killed at Upper Big Branch, described their anguish at watching Mr. Blankenship’s TV ads, titled “For the Sake of Coal Miners.” “We’re sitting here in our living room with our grandson, and there he sets up on TV — that’s sickening,” said Mr. Quarles, who also worked in Massey Energy coal mines.	11	2
3 6 2017	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/us/politics/republican-leaders-climate-change.html	How G.O.P. Leaders Came to View Climate Change as Fake Science	5	3	2	 It is difficult to reconcile the Republican Party of 2008 with the party of 2017, whose leader, President Trump, has called global warming a hoax, reversed environmental policies that Mr. McCain advocated on his run for the White House, and this past week announced that he would  take the nation out of the Paris climate accord , which was to bind the globe in an effort to halt the planet’s warming. “But the entire climate change debate has now been caught up in the broader polarization of American politics.” “In some ways,” he added, “it’s become yet another of the long list of litmus test issues that determine whether or not you’re a good Republican.” Since Mr. McCain ran for president on climate credentials that were stronger than his opponent Barack Obama’s, the scientific evidence linking greenhouse gases from fossil fuels to the dangerous warming of the planet has grown stronger. Government rules intended to slow climate change are “making people’s lives worse rather than better,” Charles Koch explained in a rare  interview last year  with Fortune, arguing that despite the costs, these efforts would make “very little difference in the future on what the temperature or the weather will be.” Republican leadership has also been dominated by lawmakers whose constituents were genuinely threatened by policies that would raise the cost of burning fossil fuels,  especially coal . Beyond the White House, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Science Committee, held a  hearing this spring  aimed at debunking climate science, calling the global scientific consensus “exaggerations, personal agendas and questionable predictions.” A small core of Republican lawmakers — most of whom are from swing districts and are at risk of losing their seats next year — are taking modest steps like introducing a  nonbinding resolution in the House  in March urging Congress to accept the risks presented by climate change. “It told Republicans that we were serious,” Mr. Phillips said, “that we would spend some serious money against them.” By the time Election Day 2010 arrived, 165 congressional members and candidates had signed Americans for Prosperity’s “ No Climate Tax” pledge . That same day, Mr. Morrissey would step outside the hotel  to announce  that he and other attorneys general would sue in federal court to try to stop the Clean Power Plan, which he called “the most far-reaching energy regulation in this nation’s history, drawn up by radical bureaucrats.” Mr. Pruitt  quickly beca me  a national point person for industry-backed groups and a magnet for millions of dollars of campaign contributions, as the fossil fuel lobby looked for a fresh face with conservative credentials and ties to the evangelical community. “Pruitt was instrumental — he and A.G. Morrisey,” said Thomas Pyle,  a former lobbyist  for Koch Industries, an adviser to Mr. Trump’s transition team and the president of a pro-fossil fuel Washington research organization, the Institute for Energy Research. Mr. Trump had, in 2012,  said on Twitter , “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” But he had also, in 2009, joined dozens of other business leaders to sign  a full-page ad  in the The New York Times urging Mr. Obama to push a global climate change pact being negotiated in Copenhagen, and to “strengthen and pass United States legislation” to tackle climate change. Hillary Clinton did not help her cause when she  said last spring  that her climate policies would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” In May 2016, Mr. Trump  addressed one of the largest rallies of his campaign : an estimated crowd of over 10,000 in Charleston, W.Va., where the front rows were crammed with mine workers. “The coal miners were the perfect case for what he was talking about,” Mr. Bennett said, “the idea that for the government in Washington, it’s all right for these people to suffer for the greater good — that federal power is more important than your little lives.” Mr. Trump took on as an informal campaign adviser Robert E. Murray — chief executive of the same coal company that had been working closely for years with the Republican attorneys general to unwind the Obama environmental legacy.	55	4

Heads to Coal Country to Hear Views on an Obama Climate Rule	5	3	2	 President Trump named Mr. Pruitt head of the E.P.A., where he has made it a top priority to reverse what he has called the Obama administration’s “war on coal.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt, like many other administration officials, question the overwhelming scientific evidence that climate change is mainly caused by human activity — a conclusion repeated this month  by the government’s own scientists  in 13 federal agencies. As part of a broad effort to uproot the environmental policies of the Obama administration, Mr. Pruitt announced in October that he would kill the Clean Power Plan, which he said did not follow regulatory norms and imposed undue burdens on states and energy producers. Holding the hearing in West Virginia “is like holding the only hearing on financial deregulation at the Wall Street Hilton — it does not denote a keen interest in alternative views,”  Michael B. Gerrard , the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said in an interview last week. During the morning hearing,  Patrick Morrisey , the attorney general of West Virginia, led off the speakers, saying that the power plan “is not only unlawful, but it’s bad policy as well.” He led the coalition of states that sued to stop the power plan. Robert E. Murray , founder and president of Murray Energy, a major coal producer, exulted, “In President Trump, we finally have a president who has vowed to preserve coal jobs.” The Obama administration’s rule, which he called the “so-called and illegal Clean Power Plan, better known as the no-power plan,” would impose “massive costs on the power sector and American consumers” while eliminating even more coal jobs. “The Clean Power Plan has a lot of support,” said Bill Price, a local organizer for the Sierra Club who grew up in the area and whose father worked in the coal mines. Since the shift to power sources like solar and wind create jobs and clean the environment, he said, the Clean Power Plan is “pro-worker, pro-economy and it’s pro-environment.” Some of the speakers marveled at the turnaround on environmental regulation that a change in administrations had wrought. “The reality is that  the coal industry has been in decline for many years .” Liz Perera , climate policy director of the Sierra Club, testified that the Trump administration had “inappropriately  cooked the books ” on the costs and benefits of the plan. Now 71 and afflicted with black lung and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, he called repealing the plan “immoral and indefensible.” He repeated a comment he gave in support of the plan in 2014: “We’re dying, literally dying, for you to help us.” Coal-fired power plants are a major source of greenhouse gases: they produce  about one-third  of the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions.	36	6

5 4 2018	https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/05/us/politics/ap-us-trump.html	Going Off Script, Trump Bashes Immigration at Tax Cut Event	4	3	2	" WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. —  Tossing his ""boring"" prepared remarks into the air, President Donald Trump on Thursday unleashed a fierce denunciation of the nation's immigration policies, calling for tougher border security while repeating his unsubstantiated claim that ""millions"" of people voted illegally in California. Trump was in West Virginia to showcase the benefits of Republican tax cuts, but he took a big and meandering detour to talk about his tough immigration and trade plans. In recent weeks, Trump has been pushing back more against the restraints of the office to offer more unvarnished opinions and take policy moves that some aides were trying to forestall. His remarks in West Virginia, like so many of his previous planned policy speeches, quickly came instead to resemble one of his free-wheeling rallies. They would have taken about two minutes,"" Trump said as he tossed his script into the air. As he has done before, Trump conjured images of violence and suffering when he described the perils of illegal immigration, though statistics show that immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than citizens. ""MS-13 is emblematic of evil, and we're getting them out by the hundreds,"" said Trump, who sat on stage at a long table in a gym draped in American flags and decorated with signs that read ""USA open for business."" ''This is the kind of stuff and crap we are allowing in our country, and we can't do it anymore."" Invoking the lines of his June 2015 campaign kickoff speech, in which he suggested that some Mexican immigrants were rapists, the president mused about the threat of violence among immigrants and appeared to make reference to a caravan of migrants that had been working its way north through Mexico toward the United States. Trump also defended his proposed tariff plan, which many of his fellow Republicans fear will start a trade war with China. He criticized West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who has expressed openness to working with the White House, for opposing the GOP tax plan. He praised attendees Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, both running in the Republican primary for Senate next month, suggesting an applause test between the two. Many members of his own party have blamed the president's lack of focus for helping to stymie their agenda, and they are eager for him to focus on the tax cut, the most significant legislation achievement on which to run in the upcoming midterm elections. While Trump went off script, the attendees —an assemblage of state politicians, local business owners, workers and families — stayed dutifully on task, talking about how the tax cuts have helped them. One woman, Jessica Hodge, tearfully told Trump: ""I just want to say thank you for the tax cuts."	99	7

If people don’t trust that their vote counts, then they won’t vote.” The round table on taxes was a lovefest for the president, in which attendees took turns praising him and recounting the ways in which the tax measure and Mr. Trump’s agenda had helped them and their families. “Your policies really have made an incredible difference in our state,” he said, adding, “We had the bull’s-eye on us until you got here, so thank you for that.” As he wrapped up the event, Mr. Trump asked the audience to weigh in on which man should win the primary next month.	30	2

""I appreciate the interview that you just did with the two students,"" Deutch said, referring to Hogg and his schoolmate Kelsey Friend.

The Wikipedia   edits came to light thanks to  @congressedits , a Twitter bot that generates updates whenever it detects someone from the House or Senate -- members, staff or anyone using an internet connection associated with the Hill -- making an edit to Wikipedia. But mixed in are plenty of moves well outside of the Beltway, from folk music to science fiction, and this week, the account provided updates for some self-referential vandalism on Wikipedia from the House of Representatives, or at least internet connections associated with it. BuzzFeed published  an article  on Wednesday, saying it looked like someone in Congress was trolling the CongressEdits bot, and after publication, at least one of the apparent editors added ""They'll never find me"" to the article about BuzzFeed. A Wikipedia administrator  blocked  an IP address associated with the House of Representatives for 31 hours, following the ""narcissism"" edit -- putting at least a temporary stop to the trolling."	46	1

""Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,"" Trump said, appearing to leave open the possibility that some documents could still be withheld. Trump's longtime political adviser Roger Stone, who helped launch Trump's campaign for president, is also an avid conspiracy theorist who wrote a book about the wild claim that President Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's vice president, was involved in Kennedy's assassination. Historians who have studied the assassination do not believe the documents will lead to any bombshell new conclusions in the Kennedy assassination, but the documents could shed more light on facets of the investigation and Oswald's mysterious trip to Mexico City weeks before the assassination. Trump can withhold the release of certain documents if he believes their release could pose harm to US intelligence, law enforcement, the military or US foreign relations. ""There's going to be no smoking gun in there,"" Gerald Posner, the author of ""Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK,"" told CNN's Michael Smerconish. Ken Hughes, a presidential researcher at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, told CNN the files could shed light on the US involvement in the attempts to assassinate Castro as well as the US-approved coup of South Vietnamese leader Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963."	30	6

That impressive fundraising haul comes after O'Rourke also outpaced Cruz in the closing quarter of 2017, $2.4 million to $1.8 million. Recent Democratic statewide hopefuls have struggled, including Wendy Davis, hailed as a rising star in the Lone Star State, only to lose the 2014 gubernatorial election to Greg Abbott by 20 points. Another factor that could benefit O'Rourke this year is the fact Texas has three competitive House races in play, including John Culberson's Houston-area 7th District and Pete Sessions' 32nd District, which covers the northeastern Dallas suburbs. Hillary Clinton lost the state to Donald Trump in 2016 by 9 percentage points -- a margin on par with her defeat in Iowa, and just a single point wider than Clinton's loss in Ohio, a perennial presidential battleground state. While the odds remain stacked against Democrats winning statewide in Texas this year, O'Rourke could give the party a fighter's chance -- especially if he's able to maintain his fundraising prowess.	34	6

Trump again muddied the waters Thursday afternoon, saying he still wants a long-term reform of the national health care system, but didn't explicitly oppose a short-term measure proposed by Alexander and Murray. Despite the senator's optimistic tone, the bipartisan health care deal appears not far from the brink of collapse -- in no small part because of Trump. ""We will probably like a very short term solution until we hit the block grants,"" Trump said, referring to his ultimate goal of replacing Obamacare with a plan that includes a block grant system for Medicaid. One conservative leader who spoke with top White House officials this week to share his strong opposition to the Alexander-Murray deal said he didn't mince words -- and warned that if Congress passes the bill, ""it would be a grenade going off on tax reform."" Ted Cruz or Mike Lee would be a ""debacle,"" this person conveyed to White House officials, and would have a domino effect of badly hurting the GOP's ability to do anything substantial going forward, including tax reform."	71	1

Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi, during the 2016 presidential election. During the height of the Republican presidential primary, Rizzuto spread smears about Trump's opponents, including Cruz, Wisconsin Gov. Among the unfounded claims Rizzuto promoted were allegations that Cruz was unfaithful to his wife and that Heidi Cruz was a leading member in an effort to combine the governments of the US, Canada and Mexico. Here is a look at Rizzuto's retweets throughout 2016: One tweet Rizzuto retweeted from February 2016 has a picture of Heidi Cruz with a headline that reads, ""This Woman Should Scare the Hell Out of All Americans"" and alleges that ""Heidi is an architect of the North American Union (NAU), whose goal is to destroy the sovereignty of the United States."" This would put Heidi Cruz in line to become the First Lady--NOT of the USA, but of the new North American Union"" In March, Rizzuto retweeted a user who shared an image of Mitt Romney that simply has the words ""Dumb Ass"" on it, and the user wrote that Satan had a hold on Romney and that he would go to Hell. In April, he retweeted an account with an unflattering image of Heidi Cruz—the same image Trump himself shared when he famously threatened to ""spill the beans"" on her— that said Ted Cruz is a ""Cheater, Liar, & Womanizer"" and Heidi is his partner in crime. Later in April, Rizzuto retweeted another account pushing the National Enquirer's affair allegations against Cruz, alongside a deformed image of Cruz."	17	4

Here's what happens next: Where Republicans stand:  GOP senators are back behind closed doors, trying to hammer out some kind of path forward.

The difference has become especially glaring in recent days, with Trump repeatedly breaking the tradition of a new president refraining from dissing his predecessor. Trump has, in fact, gone out of his way to attack Obama, as in his recent nonsensical reversal  wherein he attacked Obama  for his lack of response to Russian meddling in the 2016 election:  ""Obama did NOTHING,""  Trump tweeted. Or it works with Trump supporters, who don't seem to care if he wrecks their health care, allows factories to poison their water, or provides massive tax cuts for the rich people they admire so much. The truth is, Obama confronted Putin directly about intervening in our political system and put in place sanctions, though he clearly didn't do enough. ""I feel like we sort of choked,"" one former colleague of Obama has said,  according to an article in the Washington Post . His language was strong enough: ""The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill,"" he wrote in a Facebook post, blasting the Republican legislation that seeks to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. (Mark 11:17)  I wonder if the analogy here, with Trump and his cohorts, isn't more apt than we think. If we are to create a community that takes pride in how it cares for its own, one that promotes decent values, such as humility and tolerance and the wish to share, we have no choice but to step forward, to declare ourselves and speak up for our values. Obama needs to find his voice now in ways that, during his time in the Oval Office, he was too often reluctant to do, perhaps fearing the immense power of the bully pulpit But now there is a real bully in the pulpit, and Obama -- like the rest of us -- has no choice but to speak, and to act. My hope for Obama is that, in his post-presidency, he steps forward boldly to say whatever feels true in his mind."	10	7

John Barrasso, former Blackwater CEO and founder Erik Prince, confirmed Wednesday night he is actively considering a bid. ""All I'll say is I'm exploring my options,"" Prince said during an interview on  CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" I've had a home there for 25 years, was a resident of Wyoming for many years, already back when I was on the SEAL team, so it is an option I'm looking at."" Pressed by  Burnett  that his answer ""sounds like a yes,"" Prince repeated that ""it's an option I'm looking at."" Prince added that he only talks to Bannon ""once in a while, not often"" because ""he seems to be a pretty busy guy these days."" The interview comes just weeks after a source familiar with Bannon's thinking confirmed to CNN that Bannon was looking to persuade Prince, the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, to throw his hat in the ring. Bannon was successful last month in throwing his support behind Roy Moore in Alabama's GOP Senate primary, defeating Trump's preferred candidate, Sen. Luther Strange. Trump has recently said, ""ISIS is now giving up"" and, ""We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the previous eight years against ISIS,"" and Prince said he agreed, but also added a warning. ""The President is right, out of Iraq and Syria, where the primary tumor site is, where their caliphate is, remember, ISIS claims legitimacy because they have land, they have a caliphate, now that has largely been taken away in Iraq and Syria,"" he said.

Trump has relished releasing the documents, teasing it on Twitter and in comments to reporters, although the opportunity came to him courtesy of a law enacted 25 years ago in 1992, after the release of fellow conspiracy theorist Oliver Stone's movie about the assassination. Trump even added to Kennedy conspiracy canon when, during the 2016 campaign, he pushed the scurrilous idea that rival Ted Cruz's father had been photographed with Lee Harvey Oswald. It bears mentioning that Trump has started, pushed and profited from a number of non-Kennedy conspiracy theories during his career.	66	4

The Washington Post,  who broke the story of the payment to Fusion GPS by Clinton and the DNC , offered a few clues in their story: Clue #1: ""Fusion GPS's research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primary."" Clue #2: ""Fusion GPS's work researching Trump began during the Republican presidential primaries, when the GOP donor paid for the firm to investigate the real estate magnate's background."" That reporting corroborates  this from The New York Times  back in January:  ""The story began in September 2015, when a wealthy Republican donor who strongly opposed Mr. Trump put up the money to hire a Washington research firm run by former journalists, Fusion GPS, to compile a dossier about the real estate magnate's past scandals and weaknesses, according to a person familiar with the effort."" Assuming -- and some Republicans don't -- that this GOP donor actually exists, it's not terribly surprising that none of the major campaigns seem willing to take credit or blame for the dossier. The only possible link I could see between this GOP donor and a campaign is if he or she made contributions to a candidate or a candidate's super PAC -- in addition to the money spent on the Fusion GPS research."	86	3

Then there are Republicans who are more hard-line on immigration, many of whom see the prospect that those covered by  DACA  could be granted a path to citizenship as tantamount to amnesty, one of the most potent words in the conservative lexicon. The politics of the debate are so treacherous that there is no guarantee that any compromise forged by the various interest groups in the GOP caucus will win majority support in the party or in Congress, a dynamic that often played out in the health care and tax reform debates and can make assessing the progress of any reform effort highly uncertain."	30	3

During the campaign, he called then-Fox anchor Megyn Kelly ""crazy"" and described her during the first GOP presidential debate as having ""blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever. ""He also tweeted out an unflattering photo of Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, and threatened to ""spill the beans"" about her without explaining what that meant. During his long-running feud with comedian Rosie O'Donnell in the mid-2000s, Trump repeatedly ridiculed O'Donnell for her weight and once even attacked her for her struggle with depression. ""They called me for a comment, and rather than saying 'I have no comment' or 'isn't that too bad oh, that's so bad,' I said, 'I think I can cure her depression,' — most of you heard this. In the same speech, Trump  said  it was ""politically correct bullshit"" that people would not call O'Donnell fat. ""It's funny, I called her a degenerate, I called her the worst things, nobody cared."" I said, 'no, I called her a degenerate. I didn't call her crude, it's not strong enough.' O'Donnell  would  go on to describe Trump's attacks on her as ""the most bullying I ever experienced in my life,"" telling People magazine in 2014: ""It was national, and it was sanctioned societally. Over the years, Trump would make some of his most disparaging comments about women on  ""The Howard Stern Show."" Discussing actress Nicollette Sheridan in 2005, Trump said, ""A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10."" He also attacked model-turned-reality TV star Anna Nicole Smith's lips days in a 2007 episode after her death, saying, ""It is the most disgusting thing to look at these big fat pumped up tires."" On Twitter, Trump has lashed out at media executive Arianna Huffington,  tweeting  in 2012, "". Trump also  said  it was a double standard that actress Bette Midler could talk about his hair, but he couldn't attack her ""ugly face or body."" ""While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct,"" he  added  in another tweet. And when he was live-tweeting the Oscars in 2014, Trump  said  of Kim Novak, ""I'm having a real hard time watching the Academy Awards (so far). Trump later expressed regret for the comment, and tweeted: ""I was always a big fan of Kim Novak and still am—a wonderful actress."""	75	4

The seating arrangement around Trump during the meeting appeared to be strategic, with many of the undecided or ""no"" vote senators sitting closest to the President. Sitting immediately to the left of Trump was Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a noted moderate who has been on the fence about the health care bill for quite some time. Earlier Tuesday, Collins  took a dig at the President , suggesting Trump's lack of political experience is partly to blame for the GOP's struggles to pass the legislation. ""It has been a challenge to him to learn how to interact with Congress and how to push his agenda forward,"" Collins told reporters Tuesday afternoon, shortly after the delay on the vote was reported. When she announced she had accepted the President's invitation to the White House on Tuesday, Collins explained her reasoning for her stance on the bill: ""I will say that I have so many fundamental problems with the bill that have been confirmed by the (Congressional Budget Office) report that it's difficult for me to see how any tinkering is going to satisfy my fundamental and deep concerns about the impact of the bill."" ""It's simply not the answer,"" Heller said at a news conference alongside Nevada Gov. ""There isn't anything in this bill that would lower premiums,"" Heller said. Almost immediately after  Heller's statement , the pro-Trump group America First Policies ran ads for 12 hours against the Nevada Republican over his public opposition. To the immediate right of Trump sat Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, another moderate who has said  she has concerns about the health care bill as it stands . After the  Congressional Budget Office score was released , prompting multiple Republicans to express doubts about the legislation or reiterate that they would not vote for the bill in its current form, Murkowski said she and her fellow senators should have time to examine the numbers and understand how the bill would impact their constituents before rushing to a vote. After the bill was made publicly available Thursday, Gardner told reporters, ""We need to learn more and get the information and numbers behind it."	78	6

Ryan expressed a willingness for ""moving quickly"" on proposals to address gun violence after Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students urged the Wisconsin Republican for action, according to Florida Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch, who represents Parkland, Florida and who attended the meeting. Seventeen people died  in the February 14 shooting, allegedly perpetrated by 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, who police say used a  legally purchased AR-15 style rifle  for the massacre. Asked if the speaker was open to the things they wanted, Deutch said the students have been clear in pushing specifically for a ban on assault-style weapons, banning high-capacity magazines and universal background checks, but that Ryan made it clear some of those things don't have broad support. ""These students understand that the reason they came up here is to make sure that this debate doesn't stop, that they're not going to let it stop,"" Deutch said. Earlier Tuesday during a news conference, Ryan signaled he isn't supportive of the proposals to impose new restrictions on gun purchases, telling reporters ""we shouldn't be banning guns for law-abiding citizens."" ""Of course we want to listen to these kids, but we also want to make sure that we protect people's due process rights and legal constitutional rights while making sure that people who should not get guns don't get them,"" Ryan said. The students who survived that mass shooting have been a powerful political force, and met with other congressional leaders while in Washington,  including with House Republican Whip Steve Scalise , himself a survivor of gun violence after  he was shot last summer at a congressional baseball practice . During a CNN town hall last week that featured survivors and some slain victims' families, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said he was reconsidering his position on high-capacity gun magazines and said he  supported raising the age to buy semi-automatic rifles  from 18 to 21."	17	6

The Koch network announced Saturday that they plan between $300 and $400 million on their political and policy objectives during the 2018 political cycle as Democrats wage an intense battle to win control of the House. They believe that neither the House, nor the Senate version achieve that goal. It has to get better,"" said Tim Phillips, a top lieutenant in the network who recently met with White House officials to outline their proposed changes to the health care system. The proposed changes to Medicaid, Phillips said, were unacceptable, because they just amount to tinkering around the edges rather than reforming the program. Among them are conservative senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz, who believe the bill does not go far enough and are attending the Koch network donor retreat this weekend. For several other senators, like Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, the cuts to Medicaid go too far. 'The bill is not going to fix healthcare' The Koch network has strongly opposed the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare -- arguing that by adding people to the rolls, the quality of care for the most vulnerable Medicaid recipients has plummeted. ""It was a struggling -- frankly failing -- program before this dramatic expansion,"" said Phillips, President of Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network's political organizing arm. ""At the end of the day, this bill is not going to fix healthcare,"" said James Davis, a spokesman for the network during an afternoon session with reporters. Phillips, a top lieutenant with the network, noted that the organization was louder in their opposition to House version earlier this year, because they wanted to remind White House and Congressional officials that repealing Obamacare ""was a promise that had been made to repeal Obamacare during four consecutive national elections beginning in 2010, and that the vast majority of members had pledged that."" Activists with the network have been more engaged in negotiations on the Senate bill, which is one reason they are in a wait-and-see mode. 'We are more optimistic' Charles Koch, who was a vociferous critic of Donald Trump during the 2012 presidential campaign, did not mention the bill or the President as he welcomed hundreds of donors to the historic Broadmoor Hotel at the foot of Cheyenne Mountain Saturday evening. Instead he praised the depth and breadth of his organization, which will hold a series of seminars this weekend focused on their legislative priorities, including criminal justice reform, education, tax reform and poverty. ""We are more optimistic now about what we can accomplish than we have ever been,"" he said in remarks to donors, noting the group's work propelling the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Earlier Saturday, the network announced a new partnership with football star Deion Sanders. Six senators are taking part in the seminars this weekend: Senators John Cornyn, Cory Gardner, Jeff Flake, Ben Sasse, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee; along with four Governors: Greg Abbott of Texas, Matt Bevin of Kentucky, Eric Greitens of Missouri, and Doug Ducey of Arizona."	82	1

Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Dean Heller of Nevada to address their differing concerns about the bill. When asked whether the Senate could wait until after the Fourth of July recess, he suggested that would weaken the bill's chances. ""We're trying to make sure we keep the rates down, stabilize the system, bring down rates, protect pre-existing condition coverage and do responsible Medicaid reform,"" Cornyn said. Asked whether President Trump was doing enough to get the bill passed, he said: ""We're trying to hold him back a little bit."" Cornyn, who serves as the Senate's whip, made the remarks to reporters while attending the Koch network's donor retreat here in Colorado Springs. Ironically a number of his targets, who are either opposing the bill in its current form or remain uncommitted, were in the audience here. Sen. Ben Sasse, who is uncommitted, joked during a forum that he has a bruise just inside his left collarbone from Cornyn's thumb on his shoulder. As the Senate's number two Republican, it is Cornyn's job to pressure his colleagues to support the bill. Cruz may offer two amendments this week that could ease the bill's passage, but he would not discuss his strategy during a brief conversation at the retreat. On Saturday, US Rep. Mark Meadows — who was intimately involved in the House healthcare negotiations — said he could envision a scenario in which the Senate passed the bill this week, the House votes Friday and President Trump signs the bill on the Fourth of July. ""Wow, he is super optimistic,"" Cornyn responded when asked about that scenario. ""That would be fine with me; I'm just trying to get through Thursday night — the vote-a-rama,"" a reference to a series of votes on proposed amendments to the bill that could go late into the evening."	73	7

Jordan -- one of the founders of the House Freedom Caucus, an influential bloc of conservatives -- is someone with whom Boehner repeatedly clashed in his time as speaker. Chaffetz, who left Congress earlier this year for a job at Fox News, is talented but selfish, according to Boehner -- a ""total phony."" That's Boehner's advice to Rep.

She is one of seven Democratic candidates in the Texas 7th congressional district primary contest, and she bad-mouthed Texas. Moser wrote in a Washington magazine , ""I'd sooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia"" than live in Paris, Texas. Her rhetorical blunder caught the attention of her opponents, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), which runs House races for the party. Moser, a writer and progressive activist, was accused by the party of being an opportunist and Washington insider who moved home just to run for Congress. Tradition dictates, though, that party organizations generally stay out of picking candidates in primaries, but Moser's profile has the DCCC worried that it will blow a chance to win a congressional seat from Republican John Culberson. The Sander's progressive stances may give Moser a handicap in a Texas race, but this dustup is about more than a congressional race. Texas Democrats believe Culberson is vulnerable because Clinton  received more votes  in the district than Donald Trump in the last election, and they worry that meddling by the national party reduces their odds of winning the seat this time. That said, Democrats are also hopeful -- as early voting in Texas shows  a potential upturn  for the party. She had, however, stated publicly last May that she had already moved home to Texas.

The indictment, which was long expected, is the first example of charges filed by special counsel Bob Mueller, who is investigating Russia's attempted meddling in the 2016 election and whether any collusion occurred between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Which leads to one of two conclusions about Trump (neither of which are a terribly good look): 1) He knew about Manafort's sketchy past and didn't care -- or thought it was not a big deal 2) He didn't know about Manafort's sketchy past. Either way, the Manafort indictment -- along with that of Rick Gates, a Manafort protege  who served as liaison between even the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee even after Manafort was fired in August 2016  -- raises real questions about Trump's judgment in regard to staffing at the highest levels of not just his campaign but the federal government.	40	7

Rand Paul suffered  a painful rib injury  when he was allegedly assaulted by a neighbor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked what a potentially prolonged Paul absence could mean for the GOP agenda. While many of the gory details of what exactly prompted Paul's neighbor, Dr. Rene Boucher, to allegedly assault the Republican senator -- and exactly how five of his ribs were broken -- are unknown, authorities and Boucher's lawyer say it was prompted by a trivial, long simmering, and  now very public and embarrassing dispute over yard waste . For now, it doesn't appear Republicans will lose any roll call votes because of Paul's convalescence at his home in a gated community in Bowling Green. Paul's absence did require two votes scheduled for Monday evening to be postponed until Tuesday because Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who was dealing with aftermath of the church shooting in Texas, was also away. With several veteran GOP senators dealing with illnesses -- including John McCain of Arizona, Thad Cochran of Mississippi and Johnny Isakson of Georgia -- every vote is critical for GOP leaders. That maybe why Majority Whip John Cornyn, who oversees corralling votes, sent Paul a text message Monday to check in on him.	51	3
15 2 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/donald-trump-florida-shooting/index.html	Empathetic Trump offers no tangible solution for mass shootings	15	1	3	" Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump  consoled America's children over a rash of horrific school shootings on Thursday but he made it clear that he's not breaking from his party or political base to shake Washington from polarized positions that fail to stop such tragedies happen again and again. Trump gave an effective and moving first televised response to the tragedy at a Florida high school from the White House, looking into the camera and telling kids: ""I want you to know that you are never alone and you never will be. But in an earlier tweet, Trump appeared to blame the people of the Florida community scarred by the murders of 17 students and staff for not doing more to point out how the shooter had become alienated from society. ""So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior,"" Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. Trump's own history of no-holds-barred rhetoric and political method of using social division as a tool of governing threatened, as they have before, to undermine the effectiveness of his love-beats-hate appeal on Thursday and attempt to bring the nation together at a moment of common grief. And even though officials had promised a ""plan that works"" in response to Wednesday's horror, Trump spoke without specifics about the need to improve school safety and the need to improve mental health care. There was, for instance, no talk of whether allowing a 19-year-old -- who could not legally buy an alcoholic drink -- to get a high-powered weapon after passing background checks that could kill multiple people in seconds was a wise choice by society. In the aftermath, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders rebuked reporters saying that there was a ""time and a place for a political debate"" but not right after an attack. But it was decided it was best to wait until more facts were known about the massacre -- though Trump has never hesitated to rush to judgment during past terror attacks, even as they unfolded. Trump's absence from the television screens contrasted with the harrowing appearance in the White House briefing room by President Barack Obama, who wiped a tear from his eye after eulogizing the ""beautiful little kids"" cut down in Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Obama also called on Americans in that appearance to launch a political initiative to take ""meaningful action"" to stop mass shootings occurring, an effort that eventually failed and caused him to castigate members of Congress. Partisan breakdown This time, as after the Las Vegas and Texas church massacres last year, and the Orlando shooting in 2016 and the Charleston killings in 2015, there will be calls for action, more gun control, better background checks, bans on assault rifles and high-powered magazines and better mental health care as well as debates about whether violent video games are partly to blame. House Speaker Paul Ryan bemoaned the awful tragedy, called on his colleagues to think less about ""taking sides and fighting each other politically"" and said his chamber had already done much to stop mentally ill people from getting guns. ""I don't think that means you then roll that conversation into taking away citizens' rights - taking away a law-abiding citizen's rights,"" he said, in an interview with Tom Katz on Indiana radio station WIBC. ""If we can break the glacier of complicity in Congress, we can get measures done,"" said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal on CNN's ""New Day."" Public opinion Usually, after mass shootings, there is a spike in the number of Americans who favor new gun control efforts. One reason politicians don't pay a price is that there is no national consensus on the gun control issue, which exemplifies a cultural gulf between rural and urban Americans, and liberals and conservatives. The National Rifle Association maintains a dominant role in Republican politics, and can also threaten Senate Democrats facing re-election in red states in this year's midterm elections. Republicans, such as Ted Cruz, also immediately equate any modest efforts at gun control or attempts to ban the sale of the most powerful weapons to a bid to crush the constitutional right to bear arms and there's no political incentive for Republicans on Capitol Hill or the White House to take a risky move away from the GOP base on guns. But many liberals from cities and urban areas have never touched a gun or gone hunting and despair at the government's inability to ban assault rifles, limit magazines and improve background checks. Historically, tumultuous societal change -- that modifications to gun laws might represent -- has required incremental steps over decades, as in the fight for civil rights or equality for same-sex couples. ""I gave absolutely no faith in our Congress or elected officials to do anything,"" former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday. Or as Melissa Falkowski, a teacher who hid 19 students in a closet as Nikolas Cruz opened fire, put it on CNN Wednesday: ""Society failed those people today."""	22	7
10 11 2017	https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/09/politics/senate-tax-plan-republicans/index.html	Senate Republicans unveil their own tax plan	15	1	3	 Washington (CNN) Senate Republicans released their own version of a tax plan Thursday, and it varies just enough from the House's bill to set the two chambers up for a dramatic showdown over tax policy in upcoming weeks. The Senate tax bill includes more individual tax brackets than the House bill (seven instead of four) as well as fully repeals the state and local tax deduction, which has become a must-save item for moderate Republicans in the House. The House bill repealed the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes, but preserved the property tax deduction up to $10,000 to assuage concerns from New York and New Jersey Republicans. While the House bill eventually repealed the estate tax in its entirety, the Senate bill won't repeal the tax, but instead will double the exemption meaning fewer families will pay it. That plan also highlighted that while the Senate bill would reduce the corporate tax rate to 20%, the Senate will delay the implementation of the lower rate until after December 2018. Under reconciliation rules, the special process that allows the Senate Republicans to pass the bill with just a simple majority, the Senate tax bill cannot add to the deficit after 10 years by even one cent. Some Senate Republicans Including Florida's Marco Rubio have also lobbied to increase the child tax credit to $2,000 up from the increase to $1,600 in the House bill. And Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has lobbied the committee not to fully repeal the estate tax, which the House bill repeals after 2023. SALT, as it's known on Capitol Hill, became a major touchstone in the US House where more than a dozen Republicans from high tax states like New Jersey and New York fought to preserve at least a core part of the tax write off. After a handful of closed-door meetings in the House, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady announced he'd preserve the tax deduction for property taxes up to $10,000, but that deductions on income or sales taxes would be repealed. However, unlike the House where the GOP's majority is dependent on a handful of members from swing districts in blue states where property taxes are high, most of the Republican senators hail from lower-tax states that are more solidly Republican and less dependent on the SALT deduction. Still, House Republicans are warning that a full repeal of SALT could be trouble for passing the tax bill through the full Congress.	16	7

The frozen, acrimonious politics of Capitol Hill and the antagonism of a White House that knows only how to attack were exposed Thursday as Americans tried to process the horror of kids mercilessly killed in yet another school massacre. Then, in another dereliction of duty,  lawmakers and the Trump administration combined  on another abject failure -- to deal humanely with the hundreds of thousands of people, brought illegally to the country as kids. He only offered a vague pledge to make schools safer, and to tackle mental health -- but by omitting to even mention the nation's guns laws, made clear that any objective consideration of any necessary changes is off the table. Coastal liberals, meanwhile, have often seemed to look down on those who do no share their progressive inclinations -- and cling to ""guns or religion"" as Barack Obama once put it -- so are partly to blame for the political distemper that led to Trump's anti-establishment blitzkrieg. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio maintained that gun restrictions could not have prevented Wednesday's bloodbaths -- remarks that will raise eyebrows abroad, where firearms are hard to come by and school massacres are rare. The White House noticeably canceled its briefing for the second straight day Thursday, sparing itself questions about exactly how it was going to implement what officials said was a ""plan that works"" to stop school shootings. After the Las Vegas massacre that killed 58 people last year, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had rebuked reporters, saying there was a ""time and a place for a political debate"" about guns, but not right after an attack."	76	4

The vice president will travel to the border before President Donald Trump has been able to make such a trip, though Trump has said several times he plans to travel to see border wall prototypes. Sister Norma Pimentel, director of the Humanitarian Respite Center in McAllen, told CNN that she has been invited to meet with the vice president. She will also emphasize why she believes a border wall is not the answer to the issue of immigration and urge Pence to meet with members of the community for a better understanding of the potential impact a border wall -- a Trump administration priority -- would have on the region and its people. The Rio Grande Valley has been seen as ground zero for the immigration debate, as it's among the busiest areas for Border Patrol agents. Tickets started at $2,700 per person for lunch and go up to $35,000 for a couple to meet in a small group with the vice president, according to a person familiar with the event. John-Michael Torres, the communications director for local immigrant advocacy group LUPE (La Union Del Pueblo Entero), is organizing a news conference at a segment of border wall in Hidalgo, Texas, on Friday afternoon -- one of the cities Pence is scheduled to visit for an up-close look at the Rio Grande and a border crossing. While Torres said he doesn't expect the group's message to be seen or heard by the vice president, he thinks it's important to express local concern over Trump's proposed border wall: ""Today's visit is symbolic of the anti-immigrant, pro-wall policies that President Trump has been pushing out. We do not want Vice President Pence to leave without him hearing from local communities who continue to reject the notion of a border wall."""	29	5

Orrin Hatch,  quickly responded in kind :  ""Thank you Mr. President for the support. Back in February 2016, Romney said on Fox News, ""We have good reason to believe that there's a bombshell in Donald Trump's taxes."" Trump responded on Twitter : ""Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. The following month, Romney upped the ante with a speech that functioned as a point-by-point rejection of Trump and Trumpism. Of Romney's 2012 presidential bid , Trump said at a campaign rally in Maine : ""He was begging for my endorsement. For Trump, he sees that Romney has no serious primary challenge and is about as close to a sure thing to win in the fall as you will find in an open-seat Senate race. Now, when Romney likely wins, Trump can take credit. In endorsing Romney, Trump also plays nice with Hatch and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both of whom urged him to back Romney. For Romney,  like Adam Sandler's goat , his options are pretty much limited here. As the Boston Globe's Scott Helman told me last week , ""The Romney ethos could hardly diverge more from the Trump ethos, especially in terms of character and temperament."" No person, not one, thinks Romney and Trump can stand one another."	14	6

Bob Corker of Tennessee, learned Tillerson was leaving from news reports and didn't get a call from Trump until 9:58 a.m. The Senate -- already swamped with a banking bill, sex trafficking legislation and an upcoming federal spending deal -- learned Tuesday that it would now have to devote significant floor time not only to confirming Tillerson's replacement, who Trump named as CIA Director Mike Pompeo, but also to confirming a new CIA director to replace Pompeo.	5	5

""The state of the union is: we're safer, we're stronger, and we've gotten a turnaround in the most lethargic economic time in US history,"" said Sen. David Perdue of Georgia. ""I hope the President lays out that record of achievement that we all work together so hard to produce,"" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, citing tax reform, regulation overhauls and Republican judicial confirmations. ""I believe we should not pass an amnesty bill that creates a path to citizenship for millions of people here illegally,"" Cruz added, a possible reference to comments Trump made last week signaling an openness to such a plan for recipients of the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programming, which hardline conservatives consider ""amnesty."" Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado said he expects Trump to speak about the ""success of the tax cuts,"" and ""how Americans are succeeding, how they're growing their wages, how they're growing their investment opportunities and really, how America's back."" But Graham also cited Trump's remarks last week on immigration, when he seemed open to compromise on the issue on Tuesday, then took a harder line at a different point in the week. ""I would just ask that Tuesday Trump to come to the State of the Union,"" Graham said, referring to that softer approach. ""If Tuesday Trump comes to the State of the Union and lays out a vision like he has in the past, we're in good shape."" He also said he wants to hear about the progress being made on NAFTA negotiations, and wants to know if Trump's thoughts on trade have changed now that he has become president. Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas was also focused on trade, and said he hopes to hear Trump give a ""reaffirmation of a positive and robust trade policy."" ""He could just say a couple lines to reassure farm country that he recognizes we have to export things we grow as well as things that we make,"" Roberts said, adding it will be interesting to see what the President says in the wake of his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma said he wants to hear Trump talk about the deficit and budget issues, and hopes Trump will lay out the details of his immigration proposal. The White House is set to unveil an immigration plan on Monday, after Trump  proposed giving 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants  a pathway to citizenship in exchange for $25 billion for a wall along the Mexican border and several other strict immigration reforms. ""I talked to the President about talking about prison reform,"" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said, which is ""something I've been working on, something I know that he and others are interested in."" Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said he would like Trump to talk about funding for national security, and would also like him to ""crystallize a little more on the infrastructure package."" ""I think it'll be one of the more interesting State of the Unions,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said, underscoring Trump's unpredictable style. Hatch said Trump has two choices: to be big and bold, or ""to just make it as boring as he can."""	100	1

That number could increase after November's election: the Democrats' top two Senate targets are Republican-held seats in Nevada and Arizona, which are both among the nine the GOP controls in the high-immigration states.

""There were no defensive wounds"" on Martinez and his partner and ""there was no third-party blood or DNA evidence from the scene or from the agents' clothing,"" according to an internal memo, from acting US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, which was obtained by CNN. But FBI investigators so far have found no evidence of an attack or scuffle in Martinez's death, the FBI said Wednesday, further deepening the mystery. The investigation, to date, however ""has not conclusively determined"" how the two agents ended up at the bottom of the culvert -- a tunnel structure used for water drainage -- according to Emmerson Buie Jr., the special agent in charge of the FBI's El Paso division. Two people previously identified as persons of interest are not connected to Martinez's death, or his partner's injuries, the FBI said Wednesday. The FBI said it conducted more than 650 interviews, including interviews with federal, state and local first responders, as well as dozens of medical personnel who treated Martinez and Garland. Garland, who was disoriented and unsure of his location on the day of the incident, told the Border Patrol dispatcher he and Martinez were hurt, the FBI said. ""The second Border Patrol agent also made a statement to the effect of, 'We ran into a culvert,' 'I ran into a culvert,' or 'I think I ran into a culvert,'"" the FBI said. The dispatcher also wrote in a log: ""(He) thinks they (both agents) ran into a culvert,"" the FBI statement said. The Border Patrol dispatch told Garland to go to his vehicle and activate his emergency lights so that first responders could find them, the FBI said. ""The evidence also shows that the other agent fell approximately 22 feet away from where Agent Martinez fell, landing on his back and sustaining significant injuries to his back and skull,"" the memo said. Chris Cabrera, a spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, said the union disagreed with the findings layed out in the internal memo and the FBI's account."	64	4

Coming up from the border to visit friends in San Antonio and Austin, I often shorten the ride by running through Sutherland Springs. The community's glory days at the turn of the 20th century were a story of people riding the train out from San Antonio to spend weekends taking the curative waters of the sulphur springs along Cibolo Creek, and stay in the  52-room Hotel Sutherland . There is a post office and a white church with a low steeple, which still rises above the prickly pear cactus, live oak and hackberry trees growing on the edge of the Texas Brush Country. The town of  about 350  people is less than 30 miles east of San Antonio, but in many ways, seems much more remote. When a  black-clad gunman  walked into the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs and opened fire on the congregation, he also killed the last quaint notion Americans have about guns and mass shootings. Even if you trust in the ""good guy with a gun"" mythology of being protected, consider this: Nobody expects the faithful in a tiny town to get up on a Sunday morning and strap on a pistol before they head to their house of worship for prayer. If Sutherland Springs can become a national tragedy, the coffee shop or roadhouse where you planned to enjoy lunch on your next trip west is of equal risk. Less than six months after Abbott's tweet, a man court-martialed for abusing his wife and child purchased an AR-556 rifle at a San Antonio store, according to law enforcement. Officials also said he had sent threatening messages to his mother-in-law, who attended First Baptist on Sunday; multiple friends  told CNN his grandmother-in-law was killed . According to Abbott, citing the director of Texas' Department of Public Safety, the shooter  tried to get a license  to carry but was denied, but he was still able to make his purchase. President Trump has argued that what happened here in Texas is the result of a "" mental health problem ,"" and is not about US gun laws. His actions make clear the killer was mentally troubled, but he also lived in a country where the laws and the technology systems allowed him to access a gun, and that's not likely to change when one of his US senators, Republican Ted Cruz,  took $360,727  from the National Rifle Association while running for president. The Cruz solution to gun violence, based on his response to this tragedy, is to  offer prayers , which is what the 26 people in Sutherland Springs were doing when they died. I will ride again through  Sutherland Springs , but I won't be admiring wildflowers or  thinking about  Dr. John Sutherland, who the town was named for and whose 18-year-old nephew died at the Alamo, or the time Gen. Robert E. Lee spent in a local guesthouse. I'll instead look off at the little white church house by the side of the road and confront the memory of the day that some of the last, faint traces of American innocence were killed."	98	3
21 2 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/21/politics/trump-worst-president-ever-maybe-not/index.html	Political scientists rate Trump as worst ever, but you should be skeptical	15	1	3	 Indeed, there is good reason to be cautious in using this study of political scientists to determine what Trump's place in history is at this point or what it will ultimately be. Given that Trump's approval rating nationally  among Democrats is in the single digits , it shouldn't be too surprising that his ranking among a very Democratic-leaning sample of political scientists is quite low. Interestingly, the survey also found that Republican political scientists were also not fans of Trump. Although there is no reliable polling data that I'm aware of on Republican political scientists and their vote choice in 2016, I decided to take a look at how the precincts around some college campuses voted in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. Even among political scientists, these surveys don't necessarily stay consistent. Ulysses Grant, who was president in the 1870s, rose from 28th in a 2014 survey of political scientists to 21st in this one. (Jackson, by the way, is a favorite of Trump's, so that could also be attention that hasn't helped him with this crowd.)	41	4

Biden is the universally known, seasoned veteran whose authenticity could be an antidote to President  Donald Trump ; Patrick is the former  David Axelrod  client who Obama himself sees as a top-level talent; and if Holder's push to flip governor's office and state legislatures this fall is successful, he'll have credibility for having done the real work of reversing Democrats' down-ballot fortunes.

""The second Border Patrol agent also made a statement to the effect of, 'We ran into a culvert,' 'I ran into a culvert,' or 'I think I ran into a culvert,'"" the FBI said. Authorities were also alerted by Garland's wife, who called the Van Horn Border Patrol station saying she'd received a cell phone call in which her husband seemed confused and disoriented, according to an agent who spoke with her. The agents did not suffer ""defensive wounds"" and investigators did not find ""third-party blood or DNA evidence"" in the scene or the agents' clothing, according to an internal memo, from acting US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, which was obtained by CNN. Emmerson Buie Jr., the special agent in charge of the FBI's El Paso division, said investigators have not ""conclusively determined"" how the two agents ended up at the bottom of the culvert. Some believe it was an attack Despite the FBI's conclusion that there's no evidence of an attack, the Border Patrol union still believes the agent's injuries were the result of an attack. Our view is he was attacked,"" Chris Cabrera, a spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council told CNN referring to the FBI's investigation. Agent's family finds it hard to believe Martinez's fiancée, Angela Ochoa, and his family have said they don't understand how the agent suffered such severe injuries. Neither she nor the Martinez family had heard from Garland since the agent's death, she said."	62	5

While the recess is meant for members to get in touch with their voters, many are finding out the hard way that their constituents are unhappy with the state of Washington. Over the weekend, a number of members of Congress faced criticism and jeers at their town halls. Republican Rep. Ryan Costello experienced both  cheers and boos  during his 80-minute session with 200 attendees in West Chester, Pennsylvania Saturday. On Monday, Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina had to wait 30 seconds for crowd chants of ""you lie"" to die down, after Wilson told the crowd he had supported the local solicitor. Earlier this year, California Rep. Tom McClintock's town hall meeting got so out of control that police escorted the GOP congressman out of the venue.

But the Grassley bill likely doesn't have the backing of 60 votes or even 50, with Republicans like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham opposing the cuts to legal migration and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas signaling he may oppose the pathway to citizenship.	34	6
1 8 2017	https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/01/politics/2020-primary/index.html	5 Republicans who could challenge Donald Trump in 2020	17	1	3	" Washington (CNN) At  Politicon , a gathering of the politically nerdy in California this past weekend, Republican consultant  Rob Stutzman  made a bold prediction about the 2020 presidential race. ""It's completely feasible that there will be long, drawn-out Republican primary for Trump to be renominated,"" Stutzman said. (Note: The primary challenges did not work, but none of the presidents listed above went on to re-election.) At the same time, Trump may well be uniquely vulnerable to a primary challenge given his dismal approval ratings, his lack of connections to the major donors in the GOP and the fact that many Republican establishment types never wanted him to be their nominee in the first place. Here's a look at the five most likely contenders (listed in alphabetical order) : *  Ted Cruz : It's hard to imagine anyone disliking Trump more than Cruz. And since Trump's victory, Kasich has remained vocal in his opposition to Trump's bare-knuckled approach. In May, Kasich said this about a 2020 bid in an  interview with HBO's Bill Maher : ""I'm going to finish my term in 18 months as governor of our state, pull the state together and get it to do better and better and better. Sasse has been outspoken in condemning some of Trump's more crude comments -- about, for example, MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski -- and has  written a book  about the shrinking moral fabric of the country and what it means for young people. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" Sasse joked about a recent trip to Iowa; ""I don't want to admit it anywhere, let alone on national TV, but Nebraska lost to Iowa last year in a football game, and I lost a bet,"" Sasse said."	39	3

In today's Trump-changed political environment, this language is no mistake; it is intentional, calculated ""spontaneity"" designed to draw headlines and demonstrate outrage to similarly minded activists and donors -- using some of Trump's methodology to show their strong resistance to him. Democratic politicians using this language not only run the risk of distracting from their anti-Trump message, but may wind up looking like they're trying too hard, a phoniness voters can spot a mile away. Just eight months ago, one of Hillary Clinton's most prominent  closing ads warned  that ""Our children are listening,"" as the ad played a greatest hits of Trump's off-color comments, while former first lady Michelle Obama repeated time and again on the campaign trail, ""When they go low, we go high."" To be sure, Democrats will continue to decry Trump's politics and personality -- and will continue using one of the tactics Trump employed during the campaign -- using  four-letter words  to evoke outrage from supporters and gain media coverage."	101	7

Here's a look, more than a year out, at the 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties in the November 2018 midterms:  1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller  Primary date: June 12 In a health care battle that hurt Republicans politically, Heller's reversals and contortions were uniquely damaging. On the right, Danny Tarkanian -- 0-for-5 in the general election in his runs for office but 4-for-5 in Republican primaries -- says Heller hasn't sufficiently supported Trump. On the left, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen says he's been there when Trump and congressional Republicans needed him. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill Primary date: August 7 Running for re-election as a Democrat in a state Trump won by 19 points is tough enough. Now, McCaskill faces the challenger national Republicans had hoped to recruit into the race: state attorney general Josh Hawley, who officially launched his campaign last week. Worse news for McCaskill: At the outset, Hawley seems to have the backing of both the McConnell and Bannon crowds -- making a competitive primary that would siphon away resources less likely. Arizona Incumbent: Republican Sen. Jeff Flake Primary date: August 28 If the question was which senator is most likely to lose, Flake would be first -- by a lot. But Arizona still favors Republicans, and whoever emerges from the GOP's primary will stand a chance at keeping the seat -- even if it's Kelli Ward, whose history of controversial statements would be fodder for endless attack ads. But the possibility of other candidates entering before the late-August 2018 primary, and the bigger question of Sen. John McCain's health, add heavy doses of uncertainty to this race. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Primary date: May 8 Donnelly is a ripe target: He gambled entering the 2012 race against Sen. Richard Lugar, got lucky when Lugar lost in a primary to state treasurer Richard Mourdock, and then hit the jackpot when Mourdock flubbed a question about pregnancies resulting from rape in a debate just before the election. This is another race that features two major themes: (1) It's happening in a state where Trump cruised in 2016, and (2) Republicans are heading into what could be an expensive, brutal primary. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Primary date: May 8 It's getting lonely for Manchin in West Virginia. Like every other Democrat on this list, he's helped by Republicans failing to make him pay any price at all for voting against their bills. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Primary date: June 12 Want a 10-second explanation of why Trump drives Republicans whose job is to expand the party's Senate majority crazy? Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown Primary date: May 8 The 2016 election ended Ohio's status as the marquee swing state -- with Trump's eight-point margin of victory there making places like North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia look like potentially better targets for national Democrats. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Primary date: June 5 Tester is raising lots of money -- $1.2 million in the third quarter, with more than $5 million on hand -- and railing against ""Washington,"" not Trump. The GOP primary bears watching -- in part because it's shaping up as a proxy war between interior secretary Ryan Zinke, whose wife is involved with Troy Downing's campaign, and Sen. Steve Daines, who is aligned with state auditor Matt Rosendale. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Primary date: August 14 Baldwin is all that's standing in the way of Republicans' total takeover of Wisconsin's statewide seats -- and she'll be on the ballot at the same time the engine that drove Gov. Honorable mention Two more Democrats, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, are among the safest swing-state incumbents. If a true anti-Trump wave breaks against the Republicans, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could find himself in a competitive race against Rep. Beto O'Rourke. And whichever Republican is nominated to replace Sen. Bob Corker in Tennessee -- right now, Rep. Marsha Blackburn looks like the front-runner -- could face a tough test. State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who nearly knocked off Sen. Thad Cochran in a primary in 2014, is seriously considering the race. Democrats wonder if the GOP primary might turn this state into competitive ground just like Alabama, where controversial former judge Roy Moore faces a surprisingly serious competitor in Democrat Doug Jones in a December special election."	48	7

Luther Strange -- the Alabama Republican temporarily appointed to fill Sessions' seat, who lost a primary to Moore -- about running as a write-in candidate.

As moderate Republican members  Dave Reichert and Charlie Dent prepare to leave Congress , conservatives want stronger allies in their seats, while Democrats see an opportunity to flip them. Democrats need to pick up 24 seats to retake the majority from Republicans, who've maintained control of the House since 2011. The campaign committees on both sides are eying the 23 Republicans defending districts that Hillary Clinton won, and the 12 held by Democrats in districts that President Donald Trump won as vulnerable seats to flip.

Ted Cruz of Texas told reporters on Monday he has ""consistently opposed shutdowns,"" which later led to a response from his Republican colleague Sen. Susan Collins: ""I am rendered speechless."" Earlier on Monday, Cruz told reporters he is not for shutting the government down, following a vote to reopen the federal government after its being shuttered nearly three days. In 2013, I said we shouldn't be shutting the government down,"" Cruz told reporters on Monday. Cruz is widely accused by Democrats and members of his own party of organizing conservative lawmakers  to shut down the government in 2013  over a failed plan to defund the Affordable Care Act, though to this day Cruz has disputed that characterization. When told about Cruz's comments earlier on government shutdowns, Collins paused in her response and appeared to be in disbelief."	20	2

9 8 2017	https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/09/politics/competitive-senate-races-2018-midterms/index.html	The 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties in 2018	17	1	3	" The GOP's Senate recruiting challenges -- failing to land candidates in some states, attracting too many candidates in others, while two vulnerable incumbents are also targeted from within -- mean the party faces a long list of internal battles. Democratic senators are running for re-election in 10 -- that's right, 10 -- states that President Donald Trump won in 2016. Trump won the state with 57% support last year, and Sen. Roy Blunt was re-elected despite Missouri secretary of state Jason Kander running perhaps the best Democratic Senate campaign of the entire cycle. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Just like McCaskill benefited from Todd Akin's now-infamous comments about "" legitimate rape "" in 2012, Donnelly benefitted when his Republican opponent, state treasurer Richard Mourdock, asserted in a debate that pregnancies resulting from rape  are ""God's will."" West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin If you had any doubt about this state's heavily Republican leanings, Gov. A world in which Manchin spent two years casting votes for a Clinton agenda would have put him in much graver danger than one where he has kept a cordial relationship with Trump and maintained his own centrist brand, while enjoying the freedom to oppose the GOP's politically unpopular health care effort. That list includes  Rep. Evan Jenkins , another party-switching former Democrat, and attorney general Patrick Morrisey -- whose wife's firm's lobbying work for Planned Parenthood and a pro-gun control group could become a target during an intense primary. Flake: Trump's immigration plan 'isn't the right direction for the economy' If Flake makes it to the general election, his willingness to criticize Trump could appeal to moderate voters. But Democrats will contrast him with Arizona Sen. John McCain and argue that while McCain cast a vote on health care that actually stymied Trump's agenda, Flake has  voted with the President on key issues . Fox's decision not to run against Tester -- again, because he's eyeing the governor's office instead -- cost the GOP their second-best option. Something to watch with Rosendale: Billings Judge Russell Fagg, who is considering entering the race, recently  took a shot  at Rosendale for moving from Maryland to Montana 16 years ago -- saying his own ""four generations of Montana roots, all the way back to the late 1800s"" make him better qualified to represent the state. However, Heitkamp -- who hasn't officially announced she's running for re-election herself, but is fundraising like a candidate -- has $3 million in the bank, she's held events all across a state with a small enough population that retail politics works, and she doesn't have a Republican opponent. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Unseating Baldwin didn't get any easier when Rep. Sean Duffy, perhaps Republicans' strongest potential recruit, decided against running. Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown The well-known Brown's populist, anti-free trade brand fits Ohio's white working-class voters better than Hillary Clinton's message did in 2016. Meanwhile, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was actually outraised by Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke in 2017's second quarter -- showing that, if things really break right for Democrats, O'Rourke could be an online fundraising darling headed into the fall of 2018."	70	4

Senator Rick Santorum built his Senate staff and presidential campaign team with people who shared his world view, but that didn't mean he wanted ""yes men."" Former President Bill Clinton Adviser Paul Begala shared with me that Clinton couldn't stand a ""yes man,"" and if someone sucked up to him all the time, he would exclude them.

But that hasn't doomed past presidents from getting reelected.	15	1	3	" Washington (CNN) A majority of Americans think President Donald Trump will lose his re-election bid in 2020, according to a  new CNN poll conducted by SSRS , similar numbers to those facing former President Barack Obama at this point in his first term ahead of his re-election victory. Republicans overwhelmingly say they expect Trump to win re-election to the White House in 2020 (79% feel that way), while Democrats nearly unanimously say they expect him to lose (87% say so). None of the potential nominees raised by respondents earn more than 1% support; that list includes Vice President Mike Pence, former GOP nominee Mitt Romney, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, television personality Oprah Winfrey and retiring South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy. A broad 84% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they are likely to support a Biden bid for the Democratic nomination, two-thirds of whom say they are ""very likely"" to back his candidacy. Sanders still has the strongest grip on young voters in the Democratic party: 60% of potential Democratic primary voters under 35 say they are very likely to back Sanders vs. 52% for Biden, 29% for Warren, 18% for Harris, 16% for Booker and 12% for Gillibrand."	63	6

The Trump campaign signed on with Cambridge Analytica and brought five staff members to San Antonio, where Parscale's own outside firm, Giles Parscale, was based and where much of the Trump data operation was actually located. But in the Google forum in December 2016, Parscale said Cambridge ultimately became involved in daily polling for the campaign, known as tracking polls, helping supplement the two other sets of polling data that he would examine at any one time. The largest payment to Cambridge Analytica - $5 million on September 1, 2016 - was made about two weeks after Steve Bannon was appointed the chief executive of the Trump campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records. ""It's fair to say that we probably could have used the white pages - the phone book - and gotten a higher rate of return than we did with the expense of working with Cambridge,"" said Watts, who worked as the communications director for Carson's presidential campaign in 2015."	36	4
11 4 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/10/politics/house-retirement-tracker/index.html	There is a wave of Republicans leaving Congress, updated again	17	1	3	"  (CNN) House   Republicans are announcing they're   leaving office at a significantly faster rate than any other recent Congresses, suggesting Democrats could pick up seats in the 2018 midterm elections. Already, at least 43 House Republicans have announced they are retiring, running for another office or resigning outright, including Ryan. Democrats need to pick up 24 House seats to retake the majority from Republicans, who've had control of the House since 2011. ""We've got to find better ways to empower people where they feel like this is worth their time,"" Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas, a former two-term National Republican Congressional Committee chair who met with several members to discuss retirements,  told the National Journal  in September. But many of the Republican retirements are occurring in districts where Trump narrowly carried the vote, like New Jersey's 2nd or Michigan's 11th. While the number of Democrats and Republicans planning to run for another office is close in number, the number of House Republican retirements dwarfs those announced by Democrats."	41	1

He gained national headlines for being the first to oust an incumbent that election cycle, and again in 2016 when he publicly called for Pelosi to step down from leadership to make way for newer Democrats to chart the party's future.

He says he's working with the DCCC and his own effort to flip more red seats in the House, but adds, ""We've got to have a message, we've got to have a vision and it's going to be hard to win if we don't have new leadership."" When asked about taking a run at a top leadership post in the House after the midterms, Moulton says, ""I'm not going to write it off, but it's truly not what I'm thinking about."""	69	1
9 1 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/politics/2018-senate-race-rankings-january/index.html	The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2018	17	1	3	 Washington (CNN) UPDATE: This list, first published January 3, was updated with the news that former sheriff Joe Arpaio is entering Arizona's Senate race and state treasurer Josh Mandel is dropping out of Ohio's. Here's a look at the 10 Senate seats most likely to switch party hands in this year's midterms, as of January 2018: 1. Headed into a three-way primary that also features conservative state senator Kelli Ward -- who drew 40% of the vote against Sen. John McCain in 2016 -- the most optimistic Republicans hope that Arpaio and Ward will split the anti-establishment vote, opening the door for McSally's nomination. But Arpaio's mere presence on the ballot -- and the fact that the primary isn't until late August, which means he'll stay in the race for much of its duration -- will be a fundraising boon to local and national Democrats, and will be a powerful tool to turn out Latino voters. Danny Tarkanian, who's lost all five of his races in Nevada -- but won four of his five primaries -- is challenging Heller from the right, charging that he's insufficiently supportive of Trump. Rep. Jacky Rosen, meanwhile, lies ahead in the general election, ready to seize on a favorable environment for Democrats in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and where Heller barely won -- and did it with less than 50% of the vote -- in 2012. Unlike the special election in Alabama and contests in several other states -- including Nevada and Arizona -- Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, and McConnell, the Senate majority leader, are both backing Attorney General Josh Hawley here. Most importantly: None of the three Republicans running this cycle -- Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita and state Rep. Mike Braun -- is as talented, or baggage-free, as Young. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Manchin's early flirtations with Trump -- which included conversations about a Cabinet post -- may help insulate him in a state the President carried with 69% of the vote in 2016. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Trump met last week with Rep. Kevin Cramer, who it's safe to assume is now very likely to run against Heitkamp in this heavily Republican state. In a neutral political environment, the math suggests this seat would be an easy pickup for the GOP: Trump won North Dakota by an eye-popping 36 points in 2016, and Heitkamp won her seat by less than 1 point in 2012. But this year's crop of Democratic incumbents features several candidates -- Heitkamp, Manchin and Montana's Jon Tester stand out -- with strong individual brands at home that have allowed them to defy their state's partisan makeup. Not only that, he could force Democrats to spend heavily on their effort to retain Nelson's seat -- which could limit the party's ability to go after long shots like Tennessee. That's all good news for Tester, whose populist, down-to-earth brand -- bolstered by the fact that he still runs a farm -- allowed him to win in 2006 and 2012 despite Montana's history of voting for Republican presidential nominees (Trump won by 21 points here). Minnesota  Incumbent : Democratic Sen. Tina Smith Minnesota is ground zero in the 2018 midterms: The governor's office, as many as five House seats and not one but two Senate seats are up for grabs: Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar's and this one, vacated by Al Franken. But an open seat in a state that's moving to the right over time looks, for now, like a slightly more appealing target for Republicans than neighboring Wisconsin, which just missed this list. The reason it's still on the list at all: Trump won here by 9 points in 2016, and Republicans are desperate to lock Ohio into their column permanently. Republicans would love to put Democratic Sen. Bob Casey's seat in  Pennsylvania  in play, and they have a Trump ally in Rep. Lou Barletta to try it. The decision by Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah to retire has teed up Mitt Romney -- the 2012 Republican presidential nominee turned leading intra-party critic of President Donald Trump -- to run for a job that would give him major influence over the remainder of Trump's presidency.	28	5

But if Trump's vulgar comments weren't already making moderates increasingly nervous that they're losing in the fight to pull Trump to the center, his tweets Friday, in which he listed demands for a DACA deal, were likely to make their efforts more difficult. Ready to brief Trump on their negotiations, Durbin and Graham traveled to the White House Thursday thinking they would be meeting privately with the President, a source familiar told CNN. The bipartisan group had spent months meeting and crafting their bill and while it was long-expected to find resistance among restrictionist immigration types, more moderate Republicans on immigration had tried to make the case to the President that it was -- Flake put it -- the only game in town. But the bipartisan ""Group of Six,"" which included many of the same players that negotiated the hard right's much maligned 2013 immigration bill -- was being squeezed even before Thursday."	38	7
8 1 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/08/politics/bipartisan-daca-compromise-plan-unveiled/index.html	Exclusive: Pair of lawmakers unveil bipartisan DACA plan  	17	1	3	" Reps. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican, and Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat and whip for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have been quietly working for weeks to develop their legislation, which the two sophomore lawmakers are releasing as a discussion draft as talks heat up on DACA ahead of a government funding deadline January 19 being used as leverage in Congress. The plan aims to be ""as narrow as possible,"" Hurd told CNN in an exclusive joint interview with Aguilar on Sunday night about the proposal. The legislation draws heavily from other proposed legislation, a conscious decision by the two congressmen to lean on language that has already been vetted by committees and lawmakers, they say. At the core of the deal would be a legislative way to enact DACA, an Obama administration program that protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation that Trump has decided to end. The bill would offer qualifying individuals the ability to get in line for a green card and eventual citizenship after years of conditional residency, provided they meet certain requirements, including a background check and work, education or military service requirements. The bill doesn't make explicit reference to sponsoring relatives, but the bill summary notes that existing law would prohibit parents of these individuals who came to the US illegally to apply for a visa to come back without returning to their home country for at least 10 years before applying and the bill does nothing to erase that requirement. For the border, the bill draws heavily from Hurd's ""smart wall"" bill that would direct the Department of Homeland Security to gain ""operational control"" of the border by the end of 2020 through ""technology, physical barriers, levees, tools and other devices,"" according to a bill summary shared with CNN. Both lawmakers said they hope the deal can provide a basis for Congress to resolve the DACA issue, which Trump has said he wants replaced but only if paired with his border wall and some other immigration fixes. Leadership has not officially blessed Hurd and Aguilar's work, but party leaders on both sides, including the White House, have been looped in on its development, the lawmakers said. ""This is a DACA and border security fix,"" Hurd said. Aguilar said he has been whipping ""in the weeds"" on the issue, and Hurd has been working on his side of the aisle. The partnership evolved out of Congressional Hispanic Caucus efforts to engage Republicans and see what they could support, Aguilar said. O'Rourke affirmed that Hurd could be trusted, Aguilar said. ""We're having really substantive discussions in a way that some of our colleagues can't because they're trying to fight the battles from 10 and 15 and 20 years ago, or because this isn't something that they work with or see a lot,"" Aguilar added. Aguilar represents the whip operation of the Hispanic caucus, which has been one of the leading voices on the left and closely listened to by Democratic leadership in negotiating a deal. Hurd's district in Texas contains the most border of any lawmaker in Congress, from the outer ring of El Paso on the western edge of Texas to the region due south of San Antonio in the middle of the state. ""From my perspective, he has the most knowledge of issues that are going on in a border district than any member I've worked with or talked to, period, irrespective of party affiliation,"" Aguilar said. ""This is about solving the problem, and the only way you solve the problem is to do it with people that have the respect of their colleagues and knowledge of the problem, and that is Pete Aguilar,"" Hurd said."	94	2

Ted Cruz, faced down the White House with an ultimatum: Sign off on legislation that delays or defunds the Affordable Care Act or risk a government shutdown. Obama refused, unsurprisingly, to cut the legs out from under the law he'd spent the first year of his presidency -- and all the political capital that came with it -- selling to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including dozens of Democrats who would lose their seats in part because of their support for the controversial overhaul. And for almost all of them, future President Donald Trump was tweeting and talking, keeping up a drumbeat urging Republicans to stick together and do everything in their power to stop Obamacare, while skewering Obama as a weak leader and incompetent negotiator. Cheering on the Republicans In the weeks  leading up to the shutdown , the Republican-held House passed a bill that would have cut funding for the health care law while keeping the government open through December 15. On September 27, the Senate passed the House bill -- minus the Obamacare defunding bit. ""I mean you just have a President that is not leading and not getting people into a room and not shouting, and cajoling, and laughing, and having a good time, and having a terrible time,"" he said. ""But, you know, all of these different emotions are things you have to do but you have to get people in a room and you have to just make deals for the good of the country."" Asked about the tea party and Cruz, who agitated for the House to hold up funding, Trump praised their tactics. ""Now, maybe as we're speaking, they're going to make a deal where they do some kind of an extension, but an extension is not what you need,"" he told Morgan. ""Now, maybe as we're speaking, they're going to make a deal where they do some kind of an extension, but an extension is not what you need,"" he told Morgan. Endgame By the time the shutdown ended, just after midnight on October 17, 2013, Trump had mostly moved on to other issues."	40	6

The senator from Arizona, who was facing a tough re-election bid and  decided not to run for a second term , spoke at the Politics & Eggs series, a must-do stop for potential presidential contenders hosted by the New England Council and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College. In the year leading up to the 2016 New Hampshire primary, 18 candidates or potential candidates spoke at the event, including Trump, who would go on to win the state's GOP primary by a landslide. In his speech, which resembled remarks he gave at the National Press Club on Thursday in Washington,  Flake described Trump as a ""chaotic"" President  who has ""no strategic brilliance"" and has damaged the country's institutions. Flake's anti-Trump crusade this past year has marked a stunning rebuke of a president from a senator of the same party, and while some Republicans have criticized the President, none have matched the degree to which Flake has scorched Trump. He told a small group of Republicans he was prepared to spend $10 million on defeating Flake in the primary, and he publicly offered support on Twitter for one of the senator's GOP challengers last year when it appeared Flake would run for re-election. According to a poll by the University of New Hampshire, 60% of Republican primary voters say they plan to vote for Trump in the  2020 GOP primary, as of last month. Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire state GOP chairman, noted that many incumbent presidents who have drawn serious primary challenges have failed to win re-election in the end: President Lyndon Johnson in 1968, President Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Bush in 1992. ""Right now I can say this is the President's party, Republican primary voters in Arizona and elsewhere are firmly with the president by large majorities, but I do think that will change,"" he told reporters."	45	2

""It's a real uphill climb for him,"" Blank said, noting that O'Rourke likely benefited from launching his campaign early and being boosted by the Democratic establishment.

23 3 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/22/politics/house-vote-spending-bill-omnibus-shutdown/index.html	Congress passes $1.3 trillion spending bill, funds government through September	15	1	3	"  (CNN) Early Friday morning, the Senate passed  a $1.3 trillion spending package  that will increase funding for the military and domestic spending and will keep the government funded through the end of September, sending the legislation to the President for his signature house ahead of a midnight deadline. The House passed the legislation earlier Thursday, voting 256-167 with Democrats and Republicans coming together to pass it less than 24 hours after the 2,300-page bill was made public. President Donald Trump signed the bill later Friday after he  threatened to veto  it earlier over a lack of an immigration solution, though members of his administration have said as recently as Thursday that the President will sign the measure. On Thursday, Paul spent hours criticizing the bill and the process by which the legislation is made public and passed, and  appeared to live-tweeting  as he scanned the measure. Earlier Thursday, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when the Senate would vote -- he smiled and said in front of reporters, ""whenever Sen. Paul decides we can."" Paul not the only issue While senators waited to see if there would be a vote Thursday night, several Republicans -- including Ted Cruz of Texas and Joni Ernst of Iowa -- came out against the bill, though there's no indication that any of those senators would delay the timing on the vote. While Paul's tirade against leadership was more public, behind the scenes aides were scrambling to satisfy Risch, who was holding up the spending bill because a provision renamed the White Clouds Wilderness preserve in Idaho to the ""Cecil D. Andrus-White Clouds Wilderness"" preserve, after the former Democratic Idaho governor. First approached by what one source described as an ""angry"" Risch Thursday morning, Senate staff spent an entire day trying to figure out not just how to satisfy Risch's concerns -- which were made clear to be serious from an early stage -- but also exactly why they existed. Mulvaney admitted that the bill wasn't perfect and wasn't exactly what the White House wanted, but that -- on the whole -- the bill ""funds (Trump's) priorities."" ""If the bill passed the way it is, I would -- I hope the White House does -- does veto it. It's been a long process so they may not, but I think it's not good for the American taxpayer, and it's not consistent with -- in any way close to consistent with what we said we would do when they elected us in 2016,"" said Jim Jordan, a member of the House Freedom Caucus. Spending bill watch: House votes Thursday, leaders optimistic The internal GOP backlash to the amount of spending and the process of rushing the measure through just 16 hours after it was released was on full display on the House floor on Thursday."	56	6

""I had very limited interaction (with Cambridge Analytica) ... We made it very clear that it's something unethical,"" Tillis said, adding that his campaign team looked into the matter and that the microtargeting was a ""relatively small part of campaign."" Make America Number 1 Super PAC The Mercer-backed Keep the Promise I/Make America Number 1 super PAC paid $1,476,484 to Cambridge Analytica from 2015 through 2016. According to FEC filings, Bolton's super PAC doled out $1,152,299 for Cambridge Analytica's work from 2014 through 2016. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson During their 2016 presidential campaigns, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Dr. Ben Carson solicited Cambridge Analytica for media services, survey research, web services and database management.

Tom Cotton Cotton paid some $20,000 for Cambridge Analytica's consulting services from 2013 through 2014 as he was campaigning for the Senate."	82	1
22 2 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/22/politics/ted-cruz-cpac-trump/index.html	Ted Cruz embraces Trump ahead of re-election	17	1	3	" Washington (CNN) Up for a second Senate term in Texas this year, ""Lyin' Ted"" Cruz, as President Donald Trump nicknamed him, is suddenly Trump's biggest fan. Faced with a  potentially tough re-election battle against Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke , Cruz has used recent public appearances -- including a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday -- to embrace Trump, stake out hard-line positions in debates over gun control and immigration, and antagonize Democrats. ""The Democrats are the party of Lisa Simpson,"" Cruz said of the know-it-all character. Cruz's moves underscore his view of the upcoming midterm elections as a duel of the party's bases -- and whichever turns out more of its voters wins. He also embraced Trump's opposition to stricter gun laws, accusing Democrats of politicizing the issue after the mass shooting last week at a high school in Parkland, Florida -- as well as the President's call to arm teachers. ""Every time you see a horrific crime, people in the media and Democratic politicians immediately try to leap on it to advance their agenda, and their agenda is stripping Second Amendment rights from law-abiding citizens,"" Cruz said, adding that confiscating guns is ""where they want to end up."" ""I think it makes perfect sense that if teachers want to exercise their right to keep and bear arms, it will only make schools safer,"" he said. It all sounds like something of a 180-degree turn for Cruz, who used his speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention to urge Americans to vote their consciences -- effectively extending permission to break with the party's presidential nominee. In Dallas last weekend, Cruz aligned himself with Trump on special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, saying investigators had found no evidence of collusion, an inaccurate claim with the investigation still underway. He pleased immigration hard-liners this month by casting the Senate's lone vote against opening a debate on three competing bills that would give ""Dreamers"" a path to legal status, all of which were voted down. Cruz's moves could even come at the risk of his future presidential prospects: He angered Iowa Republicans by blocking Iowa Agriculture Secretary Bill Northey for a federal agriculture post, citing ethanol regulations that he says harm oil refineries. The Iowa Republican Party's central committee approved a resolution urging Cruz to withdraw his hold on Northey's nomination. State GOP chairman Jeff Kaufmann sent Cruz a letter warning that should he ""wish to remain in good standing with Iowa Republicans,"" he must release his hold on Northey and ""end the political points he is attempting to gain in an election year."""	70	2

Border district brawl : Party figures have split over this contest to take on GOP Rep. Will Hurd in the 23rd House District between Iraq War veteran Gina Ortiz Jones, former federal prosecutor Jay Hulings and former Agriculture Department official Judy Canales. An interesting split:  The campaign to replace retiring Rep. Gene Green in the reliably blue 29th District has seen an interesting split between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is backing Tahir Javed, and Emily's List and the other New York senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, who are backing state Sen.

Just remember that the January to June  polling average before the election  in Senate races from 2006 to 2014 had an average error of 6.8 percentage points, and a 14 point lead translates into winning 95% of the time."	63	2

The Democrats' early vote lead is a sign of enthusiasm among their base heading into the midterm elections, where Democrats are hoping to capitalize on President Donald Trump's unpopularity with their base to win majorities in the House and Senate. Cruz's sentiment was echoed by John Cornyn, the senior Republican senator from Texas, who told CNN's Phil Mattingly, with a chuckle: ""Well, it got my attention."" Cruz, unlike Cornyn, is up for re-election in 2018, and is fending off a challenge from Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a US representative from El Paso who has been touring every county in the state."	2	1

Ted Cruz. Excitement over O'Rourke's candidacy has been bubbling just below the surface for Democrats in Texas and Washington for a few months now, with optimism built, largely, on O'Rourke's fundraising ability and  President Donald Trump's surprisingly unimpressive poll numbers in the Lone Star State . But, a good chunk of O'Rourke's cash is the result of donors -- inside and outside of Texas -- who simply want to make Cruz sweat. PAC money is overrated : When O'Rourke announced his candidacy, he pledged not to accept any donations from political action committees -- a move aimed at proving he wasn't part of the DC swamp. 1, there's a tendency to assume that for any Democrat to raise the amount of money O'Rourke has that it must be coming from wealthy liberals on the two coasts who have cash to burn and just want to make Cruz's life difficult. (O'Rourke announced his fundraising through March 31 via press release but the actual report, which gives us a more detailed sense of where the money came from -- and how much of it he has left -- has yet to show up at the Federal Election Commission.)	24	6

""This legislation will go a long way toward ending unacceptably long waiting times for veterans to access health care and allow the VA the resources to hire the doctors, nurses and other medical staff it needs to address these problems over the long term."" In  a letter to McDonald dated Aug. 4, Miller said agency health care officials testified several times that a VA review of 250 million consults since 1999 determined that 23 patients died from gastrointestinal illnesses because of delays in medical consultation. “And we’ll be working with and we’ll be watching the VA to make sure they’re carried out and that the money is spent wisely, so veterans get the health care they need.” Celli said the Legion will also be watching how McDonald fares during his first few months on the job."	93	4

You know, I have been campaigning across New York and people are stopping me literally every day and say, I know exactly what you meant, and I'm fed up with what these Liberal Democrats are doing to us, the people of New York. Hold a press conference in Penn Station. Hold a press conference in Penn Station. : The perception of New Yorkers and almost 10,000 people showed up to hear Trump speak at Bethpage on Long Island. I know exactly what you meant by that and he brought up that Andrew Cuomo, the governor said if you are pro-life, if you support traditional marriage, if you believe in the Second Amendment, there is no place for you in New York state. : Bill, it's actually -- Bill, it's actually not a question of being more conservative or not. Hillary Clinton has made millions of dollars selling power and access in Washington and Donald Trump has made billions of dollars buying power and access in Washington, buying people like Hillary Clinton. All right. : All right. : All right. Now, in New York -- : If I'm elected president, we will repeal ObamaCare. But in New York, specifically, you got a governor who is not going to frack, okay, if you fracked, you would help Upstate New York like crazy.

Ted Cruz outlines his tax reform plan	15	2	3	" President Trump is telling Congress, Do your job, get to work on passing historic, Reaganesque tax reform that the American people voted for and they will benefit from. Now, the president sat down with a group of bipartisan lawmakers at the White House earlier today, and here's what he said. TRUMP: It's time now to build new roads, new bridges, airports, tunnels, highways and railways all across our great land. (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: Now, notice, but for DACA, the president was echoing everything he promised you in the campaign. Look, the president is reaching across the aisle to try and get things done because, let's face it, Republican leadership in Congress -- they have failed miserably and at every turn. And the president -- frankly, I don't blame him -- he's done waiting and he's forging ahead with or without Mitch McConnell. Now, the president understands this all has to change, because unlike the vast majority of politicians in the swamp and the sewer and the so-called policy wonks in D.C., well, the president -- he's actually run a business. And the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin -- he's saying the administration wants to make these tax cuts retroactive. Now, here's the senator explaining today what you, the American people, need and why you need tax reform. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: Our economy since World War II has grown on average 3.3 percent a year. And by the fourth year of Reagan's presidency, 1984, we went from stagnant economic growth, less than one percent a year, to 7.2 percent a year -- massive, booming growth lifting millions out of poverty, increasing significantly median incomes! Now, President Trump and Senator Cruz's philosophy on tax reform is simple. And I'm specifically talking about, you, Senator Mitch McConnell and the never-Trumpers out there like, let's see, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake -- oh, Ben Sasse. No more blaming the president like Mitch McConnell did last month, and he said the president had excessive expectations, and well, he doesn't understand the parliamentary procedures and the difficulties of legislation because he's never done this before. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, AUG. 7) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., MAJORITY LEADER: Now, our new president has, of course, not been in this line of work before and I think had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process. Senator McConnell, other Republicans, if you don't get the urgency to work for the American people, if you don't pass tax reform by the end of this year, you need to resign, go home, play golf, and get out of the way and let's get people in those positions that can serve the American people. Now, instead of whining and complaining and pointing fingers about why you can't pass legislation, you people in Washington and Congress, time to roll up your sleeves, get in a room -- I'll send you pizza and beer -- and turn off the air conditioner, like our framers and founders, and get to work and don't leave the room until you build consensus to help people. HANNITY: Listen, I see that your plan and the president's plan are almost identical. CRUZ: Well, look, I think the president is frustrated. HANNITY: All right... CRUZ: Let small businesses create more jobs, raise wages. HANNITY: Senator, here's your plan. HANNITY: Senator, you mentioned that you still think the window's open on health care. One of the proposals -- and as a conservative, I always kind of like the idea of sending stuff back to the states... CRUZ: Absolutely. You know, I think we're --  HANNITY: I'm -- Senator, I want to say one last thing. CRUZ: Well, Sean, the role I'm trying to play is do everything I can to help and encourage the president to go in a positive direction, not a negative direction, and to bring Republicans together, talking to conservatives and moderates and leadership and the president and the administration saying, Everyone, look, if we do our job, just keep our word, the economy booms... HANNITY: That's it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" HANNITY: You know, look, let's be honest here. Knowing the president as well as I do, I suspect, knowing Donald Trump, that he's basically sending a loud message, Get your act together or I'm going to find another way. But if he has to work with somebody else to get things done, he's going to do that, Sean, because he is results-oriented. HANNITY: Oh, listen, I think his more important issue is serving the American people. HANNITY: When we come back, Hillary Clinton continues -- we're now up to 42 specific excuses, blaming everyone but herself for her election loss. Watch this. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: I don't think the press did their job in this election, with very few exceptions. And she's over there, saying, OK, here's how we're going to raise taxes on the wealthy. Here with reaction, RNC spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany is with us, and former special counsel to President Clinton, probably Hillary's best friend, Lanny Davis. Sexism, racism misogyny, xenophobia, suburban women, Comey, FBI, Russia, Putin, WikiLeaks, DNC, Obama, Biden, Sanders, Weiner, Electoral College, polling data, cable news, New York Times, fake news bots, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, TV executives -- I'm keeping going here -- anti-American forces, Democratic documentaries, low-information voters, people wanting change, people that assumed she'd win, of course the Republican Party, contest forums in Macedonia, Infowars, Guccifer, D.C. leaks, Jill Stein, Bannon, voter I.D. But let's take the occasion for a historic moment, and that is there's something that Hillary Clinton and President Trump agree on, which Clinton has said publicly now. That sounds like a poor decision by the president which led to the Mueller appointment, but I do think he should have been disciplined because of his recklessness and the way he handled Hillary's email investigation, and President Trump and his deputy attorney general agree with that statement. HANNITY: I didn't ask you that question in any way, shape, matter, or form. DAVIS: We do agree, and, Sean, I believe you agree, that when the deputy attorney general criticized Comey for poor judgment, for violating the rules, and that he deserved to be disciplined, I can show you data that on the day that Comey wrote his letter Hillary Clinton was ahead in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan but six to eight percentage points, and within two days of that letter, she plunged. MCENANY: I just want to debunk one --  HANNITY: It's a crime, though. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think that's one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make, and certainly something I think it's a fire-able offense by ESPN.

TOMI LAHREN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it's happened at ESPN before. HANNITY: Dr. Loudon, isn't there something wrong if you're so willing to lie about other people? DR. GINA LOUDON, PSYCHOLOGY EXPERT AND RADIO HOST: Yes, there's definitely something wrong with somebody who is going around name calling instead of acting professional. HANNITY: Dr. Loudon, I think we conservatives are far more tolerant of freedom of speech, expression, and thought. LOUDON: Well, there's always a hypocrisy, Sean, and we're used to it. (LAUGHTER) HANNITY: All right, it's a wonderful life, Dr. Loudon. MCLAUGHLIN: Well, maybe that's a discussion for another day. MCLAUGHLIN: I don't think that if you hear something that you don't like, you should call for the firing of that person.

ADVERTISEMENT But Texas Sen. Ted Cruz thinks he knows exactly what has happened, and broke down the horse race exclusively for the  's Your Choice, Your Voice Teleforum. Cruz detailed his path to victory and who he expects will be his main opposition. ""Historically in the Republican primary, there have been two major lanes: there's been a moderate establishment lane and there's been a conservative lane,"" Cruz said. ""And in past elections, typically, the moderate lane there is a consensus moderate choice early on and all of the money gets behind that candidate. But on the conservative side, typically there are a whole bunch of us, nobody has any money, and we fight like cats and dogs. And that's how in primaries in past cycles, the moderate has gone on to win the nomination and then they lose the general election because millions of conservatives stay home and don't vote."""	38	6

A new survey by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic group shows Trump maintaining a strong lead in South Carolina with 35 percent of likely Republican voters backing him. Joining us now with reaction from Columbia, South Carolina Alice Stewart, senior adviser for the Cruz campaign; and from Dallas Trump national spokesperson Katrina Pierson. And specifically with this new ad on Planned Parenthood, Donald Trump simply says that cervical cancer screening for poor women is a good thing, even though he opposes abortion and opposes funding for abortion for Planned. It's obvious that Senator Cruz needs South Carolina to move forward and he is not going to stop at anything, including misrepresenting his positions on pretty much everything at this point -- Eric. The fact of the matter is Ted Cruz has done nothing but point out Donald Trump's exact words, exactly as he said them. : Well, first, I would like to ask Alice if she actually believes Mr. Trump supports abortion because the ads that the campaign are running are from 17 years ago. Senator Cruz props up people like Ronald Reagan who, as governor of California, signed the most liberal piece of abortion legislation in that state, in the country's history, Alice. Well, it was just last week when we were on the debate stage when Donald Trump said that he supports taxpayer funding for the nation's largest abortion provider. He has said repeatedly that he is -- Mr. Trump said he supports the good things, the good things like cervical. Talking about our vets --  Katrina, now -- : Donald Trump is pro-life and has been for a very long time. I'm going to start with you Katrina, in the aftermath of the last debate where Donald Trump had mentioned some things about George W. Bush yet afterwards the poll numbers haven't seem to have budged. Is Ted Cruz concerned that the poll numbers in the aftermath of the -- what a lot of people thought this was the one thing that's going to give Donald Trump his numbers to come down after all the other things.	55	3

Ted Cruz: 'It's only fitting' cartel money be used for border wall	15	2	3	" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that ""there's a justice"" to his proposal that money seized from drug cartel capos be used to pay for President Trump's promised border wall. ADVERTISEMENT ""These drug cartels are the ones crossing the border with impunity, smuggling drugs, smuggling narcotics, engaged in human trafficking,"" the Republican told host Tucker Carlson. ""They’re the ones violating our laws and it’s only fitting that their ill-gotten gains fund securing the border."" Federal prosecutors are looking to seize $14 billion in drug profits from the Sinaloa Cartel leader, who is facing trial in the U.S. on a multitude of federal charges. ""Now, it so happens, coincidentally, that the estimated cost of the wall is between $14-20 billion,"" Cruz said. ""So, the legislation I filed yesterday was very simple."" On Monday, Cruz introduced the Ensuring Lawful Collection of Hidden Assets to Provide Order (EL CHAPO) Act. ""It said any proceeds that are forfeited from El Chapo and from other drugs lords shall be spent building the wall and securing the border,"" said Cruz, who also praised the Trump administration for their willingness to enforce immigration laws. ""I visited with about 150 Border Patrol agents [in January],"" Cruz said. ""The relief these men and women had at the election results, it was palpable ... And I asked the agents, ‘What’s changed?’ And they said, ‘The only thing that’s changed is the cartels understand now we have an administration that will enforce the law.’ That matters."""	40	2

31 10 2015	https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/fashion/who-was-the-real-lou-reed.html	Who Was the Real Lou Reed?	16	3	3	 After  Lou Reed  died of liver disease on Oct. 27, 2013,  Rolling Stone  wrote that he “fused street-level urgency with elements of European avant-garde music, marrying beauty and noise, while bringing a whole new lyrical honesty to rock & roll poetry.” His old friend Patti Smith, writing in  The New Yorker , called him “our generation’s New York poet, championing its misfits as Whitman had championed its workingman and Lorca its persecuted.” Laurie Anderson, his wife since 2008, described Reed in The  East Hampton Star  as “a tai chi master” who spent his last days on the South Fork “being happy and dazzled by the beauty and power and softness of nature.” “Lou was a prince and a fighter,” she wrote. Many damning anecdotes, she added, seem to come from people Reed knew in the hazy drug-fueled 1970s “that I know for a fact were not capable of remembering anything they did in any given six-month period during that time, much less come back all these years later and say, ‘Oh, yes, I was there, this is what was going on.’ ” Readers will have to decide whether the musician was simply a rock-and-roller taking a walk on the wild side or the disturbed individual Mr. Sounes portrays. The week of the  Woodstock festival , the Velvet Underground were playing at a roadhouse in Massachusetts.” At a time when the rock world was entranced with kaleidoscope LSD visions, Reed was bingeing on speed and, as his bandmate John Cale has said, acting like a “queen bitch” and spitting out “the sharpest rebukes around.” “Meth made him feel like Superman,” Mr. Sounes writes; he reportedly told one friend that “he was going to take meth every day for the rest of his life. Once, he gave her a black eye, so she swung back at him: “It was pretty clear to me that the only way he would ever stop doing that was if I did it to him, so he’d have to walk on stage with a black eye.” While Mr. Sounes’s book offers a detailed analysis of Reed’s music, as well as some flattering anecdotes, it is the dirt on Reed that has gained news media attention. When he received an advance copy of the book, Mr. Fields said, “I looked up my name in the index, read my quotes, sighed and put it on the shelf.” His conclusion: “Poor Lou, his act worked too well.” Legs McNeil, the writer who helped found Punk magazine in the ’70s, said that Reed’s unhinged behavior hardly stood out in a circle that included berserkers like Iggy Pop. An interview might start off with benign questions about songwriting, but as Reed once jokingly said to Mr. DeCurtis, they were eventually going to ask, “‘Did you have sex with a goat in Central Park with David Bowie in 1975?’ ” (In addition to Mr. DeCurtis’s book, Rolling Stone’s Will Hermes is scheduled to publish  “Lou: A New York Life” ; Luc Sante, the chronicler of New York street life and culture, also said he recently started a Reed biography that he intends to be “proportionate.”) In the latter years of Reed’s life, there was not much tawdry material to keep journalists titillated. “He was one of the strongest, bravest people I’ve ever known.” Howie Klein, the former president of Reprise Records, recently posted a retort to Mr. Sounes’s book called “A Very Different Lou Reed From the Guy I Knew” on his blog,  DownWithTyranny!	45	7

Mr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is “a neutral public platform.” “I do agree that we should give people a voice,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. • Rep. Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg’s promise to give users worldwide the same privacy controls required by a tough new data protection law which will go into effect in the European Union next month. Those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign’s app and Cambridge Analytica’s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for. Mr. Musk told co-host Gayle King: Andrew writes: These were the most important words from Mark Zuckerberg’s five-hour testimony: “I agree we are responsible for the content.” They may come back to haunt him, given his previous rejection of calling Facebook a publisher. More from  Peter Eavis : Critics’ corner •  Paul Pendergrass  writes, “If Mr. Zuckerberg can convince lawmakers and users that he is the most capable and determined person to fix his company’s problems, then the company can start turning the corner on this crisis.” •  Kara Swisher of Recode  tweeted that Mr. Zuckerberg won yesterday’s hearing “not because he was so good (he was fine if a little flat), but because the senators really dropped every single ball possible.” •  Sara Fischer and Dan Primack of Axios  write, “Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday morphed from a shy tech nerd into a confident business executive who ran circles around lawmakers.” •  Shira Ovide of Gadfly  writes: “Zuckerberg believes he’s giving users control, but he’s giving them the illusion of control.

11 4 2018	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/books/review/michelle-dean-sharp.html	Ten Women Whose Tongues and Pens Were as ‘Sharp’ as Knives	14	3	3	 “One must have a mind of winter,” Wallace Stevens writes in his poem “The Snow Man.” It’s the cold eye that beholds, without sentimentality or fear, “Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.” In “Sharp: The Women Who Made an Art of Having an Opinion,” the journalist Michelle Dean has rounded up 10 minds of winter, all of them female, all of them prominent writers whose criticism, long-form reporting, fiction and satire have shaped thinking on world events and cultural dramas: Dorothy Parker, Rebecca West, Hannah Arendt, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag, Pauline Kael, Joan Didion, Nora Ephron, Renata Adler and Janet Malcolm. Woolf was a consummate artist and pioneering feminist, arguably greater than any of Dean’s 10, while Parker, who could be harder on herself than she was on her victims — self-regarding writers (whom she parodied), forgettable plays, bad books — wouldn’t dream of calling her writing “art.” By stressing “opinion” in the book’s subtitle, however, Dean has framed sharpness as a barbed pulpit in which the public intellectual or critic-as-virtuoso resides. Positioning herself not as a scholar breaking new ground (many of these women have been well covered in biographies, memoirs and academic studies) but as a missionary championing her subjects’ “oppositional spirit,” Dean artfully shepherds the reader through the professional and personal ups and downs of each life, keeping an eye on the affinities — a taste for battle, an ethic of intellectual honesty — that made some of them allies (McCarthy and Arendt, Arendt and Adler) and drove others apart (McCarthy and Sontag, Adler and Kael). (A story went around that McCarthy baited the younger Sontag, who was suddenly turning heads, by saying, “I hear you’re the new me.”) The political philosopher Arendt “was steadfastly against feminism until her dying day,” Dean writes. One is also curious to know where Dean stands on Arendt’s “Eichmann in Jerusalem,” a 1963 meditation on war crimes that was incendiary because of its problematic phrase “the banality of evil,” and a tone so cold that Arendt’s friend the Jewish historian Gershom Scholem thought it flippant (some used the word cruel).	21	3

Mr. Zuckerberg’s appearance, his first before Congress, turned into something of a pointed gripe session, with both Democratic and Republican senators attacking Facebook for failing to protect users’ data and stop Russian election interference, and raising questions about whether Facebook should be more heavily regulated. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook had become a monopoly, asking why Congress “should let you self-regulate?” Mr. Zuckerberg said he welcomed some form of regulation, as long as it was the “right regulation.” He also expressed support for the Honest Ads Act, a bill in Congress that would require more disclosures from online political advertisers. His answers did not mollify lawmakers, including Mr. Graham, who said in a statement after the hearing that “continued self-regulation is not the right answer when it comes to dealing with the abuses we have seen on Facebook.” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview that he was “unsatisfied” and that it was clear Facebook could not and would not fully regulate itself and that Congress needed to provide a solution. Mr. Zuckerberg offered humor about the company’s onetime mantra: “move fast and break things.” (It has since been edited to “move fast with stable infrastructure.”) He insisted on continuing questions when offered a break, eliciting smiles and laughter from staff sitting behind him. However, when Mr. Zuckerberg did take a break, he left behind his notes, which were quickly photographed and contained talking points for various topics including “Defend Facebook,” “Disturbing Content” and “Election integrity (Russia).” His performance won accolades on Wall Street. “It’s a defining 48 hours that will determine the future of Facebook, and so far he has passed with flying colors, and the Street is relieved.” But Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that his idealistic view of humanity, and those of his fellow executives, had exposed Facebook’s roughly 2.2 billion users to danger. Among them: Facebook failed to detect and stop Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, an oversight that Mr. Zuckerberg called “one of my greatest regrets.” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Facebook and its role in society “extraordinary” and began the hearing by explaining that Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg were being singled out because of the company’s power. Mr. Thune said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how Facebook could be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared “to be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users’ information.” In an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, “In the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies’ efforts to regulate themselves.	15	5

Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Mercer declined to answer questions about her role in Mr. Trump’s circle or the Facebook meeting about Cambridge Analytica. Although a Cambridge spokesman last month downplayed Ms. Mercer’s role at the company — saying she had a “broad business oversight” role and no involvement in its daily operations — she serves on the company’s board and in the past has worked to drum up campaign business for Cambridge, according to Republicans who have worked with or competed against the firm.

Asked whether Facebook will sue the researcher who created the app,  Aleksandr Kogan, or Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Zuckerberg said “it’s something we’re looking into.” Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, zeroed in on a line of questioning that his Texas counterpart in the Senate, Ted Cruz, also asked, pressing Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk.

Jones' campaign has worked hard to convince Democrats to take seriously the former prosecutor's chances of defeating Moore -- the twice-removed former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice whose theocratic campaign message has alienated some moderate and pro-business Republicans. The Senate Majority PAC, the major Democratic super PAC focused on Senate races, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are still watching to see how the race develops before deciding whether to get involved -- keenly aware that Jones being seen as a candidate backed by the Democratic machine would be fatal in deep-red Alabama. RELATED: Alabama senate candidate repeatedly appeared on radio with pastor who preaches penalty for homosexuality is death Jones was shepherded around Washington during a recent Congressional Black Caucus conference by Alabama's lone Democratic congresswoman, Terri Sewell, and consultant Joe Trippi. Another left-wing group, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, is railing against Moore -- but is taking the more cautious approach of urging donors to split their contributions among Jones, Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, two pro-LGBT bulwarks. The Bannon-aligned Great America PAC is asking if Mitch McConnell's super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, which spent more than $10 million backing Strange in the primary, is ""unwilling to spend as much to defeat a Democrat as they were willing to waste smearing a fellow Republican."" ""The best way for Mitch McConnell to atone for this mistake is for him and his allies at the Senate Leadership Fund to put their money where their mouth is and provide Judge Moore with the same level of financial support in the general election as they gave to Strange in last week's Republican runoff,"" Great America PAC strategist Ed Rollins said in a statement. The super PAC said after Moore's primary victory that it would support him, but has not spent in the race yet, with the December 12 general election is still more than two months away. Moore was in Washington on Wednesday for meetings -- including a visit with Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist who has provided Washington muscle for anti-establishment Senate primaries, and a huddle in the Capitol Hill Club with the state's Republican congressional delegation. Rep. Mo Brooks, the third-place finisher in Alabama's Republican primary behind Moore and Sen. Luther Strange, said afterward he was ""not going to discuss any of our strategies on helping make sure that Doug Jones, liberal Democrat, does not win."""	5	2

Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, was stunned by the audio he was hearing, the sounds of a gun popping at a concert in Las Vegas at a frequency he was almost sure wasn't just coming from a semi-automatic weapon. He started telling me about, not just the bump stocks, about a crank and other methods to mechanically increase the rate of fire,"" Flake said. Sen. John Cornyn, the majority whip who called for hearings on the bump stocks this week, also said it was the video footage that got him thinking about the gun accessory. RELATED: Republican-led bill on bump stocks expected to be introduced Thursday in House ""You know, I'd heard about them before, but I'd never actually seen one, and I certainly had never seen a video of someone using them to spray a concert audience of 22,000 people with gunshots,"" Cornyn said. ""I think we ought to have hearings on it, look at it, and I think we shouldn't be marketing or allowed to market things that make our guns illegal like they do,"" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat who was governor during the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007, said that it was his son, a member of the Marine Corps, who got him up to speed on the accessories that convert semi-automatic weapons to firing more like an automatic one. What makes the bump stock debate different, members say, is the fact that automatic weapons -- guns that unleash bullets in rapid succession with just a single pull of the trigger -- are already highly restricted in the US. Therefore, members argue, it's hard not to take a look at a device that would transition a legal weapon into one that fires at a rate similar to the tightly restricted ones. Even Cornyn, the Republican from Texas calling for a hearing, hasn't said he wants to ban bump stocks with legislation."	66	2

Jeff Flake of Arizona, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will not run for re-election, he said Tuesday in a blistering speech on the Senate floor that bemoaned the ""coarsening"" tenor of politics in the United States. ""If I have been critical, it's not because I relish criticizing the behavior of the President of the United States,"" Flake said. ""It's difficult to move forward in a Republican primary if you have been critical of any of the behavior that's gone on,"" Flake said on CNN's ""The Lead."" And it turns Arizona -- once a Republican stronghold but increasingly competitive in recent elections -- into perhaps the most important state in the 2018 midterms, with Flake's seat now open and questions looming about Sen. John McCain's long-term prognosis as he is treated for brain cancer. ""One of the greatest people I've served with,"" Corker said after the speech, describing Flake and adding later, ""He's what I would call a real conservative."" Sen. John Cornyn, the second ranking Republican in the chamber, said it is ""a very sad day"" and GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who recently decided to skip a run for governor and stay in the chamber, said she was ""incredibly disappointed"" by Flake's decision. RELATED: In Arizona, it's Flake vs. Trump in a test of the GOP's allegiances In the book, Flake worries about ""the strange specter of an American president's seeming affection for strongmen and authoritarians."" The fight in Arizona Flake's decision opens the door for Ward, a conservative former state senator who many Arizona Republicans see as a controversial and problematic general election candidate. As Republicans look for another candidate to enter the primary, all eyes are now on DeWit, who was the Trump campaign's chief operating officer, one Arizona Republican operative said."	71	3

The reality is that China has much to lose in a war on the Korean Peninsula, which would deeply affect its economy and risk massive migration of North Koreans coming over the border. Presidents of both parties over the years have taken advantage of a congressional abdication of responsibility in this regard and  seized for themselves  the right to start wars, even in the absence of any imminent threat to our country. Unless Congress reasserts its important constitutional power, the risk of an unchecked President starting an unnecessary war will remain high during this administration. Not many Americans realize that nearly 70 years since the Korean War began, the conflict is in  a cease-fire mode  -- with an armistice stopping active hostilities, but no peace deal. Over the years, North Korea has broached the idea of a peace treaty to end the war. We should engage in dialogue without precondition and see whether an offer of a peace deal might provide North Korea with a degree of comfort that would reduce its motive to keep pouring resources into militarization, instead of meeting the needs of its people. We have seen the painful consequences of unnecessary war, and we risk stumbling into another one if President Trump doesn't get serious about diplomacy with North Korea.	65	5

Nobody was turned back and what I believe, and I think a lot of Americans would agree, is instead of accepting these 90,000, they should have -- the humanitarian way to address this is reunite them with their families and their country of origin because this 90,000 is going to be hundreds of thousands,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo Wednesday.

Cernovich, who describes himself as ""new right"" but has been associated with the alt-right movement, is an online activist who regularly tweets inflammatory statements about race and sexual assault, as well as unfounded conspiracy theories.

He has also pushed conspiracy theories that the Orlando Pulse shooter did not act alone and that Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman was part of a sex cult. During Stewart's appearance, Cernovich explained that he calls establishment Republicans ""cucks"" because ""they like to see Trump get screwed over by the media, that's what they get off on.""

Trump's comments were the latest in what has been a jaw-dropping saga ever since the President made his first vague statement on the violence, blaming the conflicts on ""many sides."" 'Many sides' On Saturday, as violence in Charlottesville played out on national television, Trump blamed ""many sides"" for the conflict. Trump, after mounting pressure that was palpable inside the White House, spoke Monday and condemned the white supremacists and neo-Nazis at the heart of the violence. On Tuesday, though, Trump defended his 48-hour delay in denouncing white supremacists, arguing that he took his time because he didn't know the facts.

Trump and senior aides inside the White House -- both publicly and privately -- have urged Scott to run for Senate, hoping that the Republican governor will challenge Florida Democrat Bill Nelson and possibly help stem a blue wave in 2018. In a nod to Scott's standing inside the administration, Zinke even traveled to Florida to discuss the decision with the governor and gave the him almost all of the credit for protecting his state's coastline. Heather Swift, spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said there were no politics involved in the decision to give Florida a waiver from Interior's offshore drilling decision, arguing that any coastal governor can request a meeting with Secretary Zinke. Governors demand same treatment Zinke's decision has led to extensive complaints by other coastal governors who have already staked out not-in-my-backyard opposition to expanding offshore drilling, often on the same tourism concerns Florida has. Henry McMaster -- a vocal Trump supporter -- told reporters in South Carolina on Wednesday that he opposes Trump's offshore drilling plan and will take ""appropriate steps"" to counter it, according to video provided to CNN. And a spokesperson for Charlie Baker, the popular Republican governor of Massachusetts, said Wednesday that he opposes Trump's plan to allow offshore drilling up the East Coast. The decision to exempt Florida could also open the Trump administration to legal challenges, allowing states not exempted to complain that the decision is arbitrary because one state was left off the list because Zinke talked with the governor."	99	6

Lee. The explicit white supremacist message attached to the New Orleans monument Stewart is defending makes the oft-used claim by defenders of the Confederacy of ""heritage, not hate"" tough to swallow here, and whatever role it might play in a Virginia Gubernatorial primary, is yet another example of why Virginia's Republicans continually  fail to attract minority voters . Having maximized support from white working-class voters last year, the GOP must make serious, sustained efforts to appeal to minority voters who for too long have only heard a Republican message that -- whether on immigration, monuments or coarse and tasteless jokes about the Obamas -- consisted of ""We don't like you,"" which ultimately eclipses efforts on issues like school choice, job and wage growth or criminal justice reform. By contrast with Stewart, in  removing the Confederate flag  from the State Capitol in 2015, and doing so by bringing together people of different backgrounds and ideologies, former South Carolina Governor -- now UN Ambassador -- Nikki Haley demonstrated a path forward for how Republicans can get things right on thorny, historical issues of race."	27	4

That's  what's changing in New Orleans  as construction workers undertake the work of removing four statues and monuments dedicated to one of the worst periods of US history. It harkens back to the days white violence was used to oppress black Southerners, especially when they dared to make progress at the ballot box, in the classroom, to assert their God-given rights. Corey Stewart, a Republican hoping to be the next governor of Virginia, and others like him are so blinded by their rage, their hatred, they can't see the irony in their protests. The Confederate leaders Stewart and others want to forever have places of honor gave rise to a Jim Crow South where systematic lynching, raping, and killing occurred on our soil for longer and caused more damage than ISIS has in the Middle East. Leaving up Confederate flag and monuments built by men honoring that horror would be akin to forcing the victims of ISIS to forever live under the notorious ISIS black flag and live amid monuments and statutes dedicated to ""brave"" ISIS commanders. Removing those statues, like renaming buildings that bear their name or taking down the Confederate flag -- and even reexamining the presence of slave owners and slave rapists on our currency -- is a long overdue reckoning with our past. Museums are designed to contend with the complexity of these men's legacies, something that can't be practically done with a few lines of text carved into a statue. We are well into the 21st century and have yet to find the moral courage to say that if you commit some of the most horrific acts known to man -- owning other human beings, betraying your country to preserve slavery -- you forfeit the right to be remembered on public monuments and statues and currency that should be reserved for only the best among us."	2	3

Holding elections on Tuesdays gave farmers enough time to get to the polls, get back home, and get their products to market. There are proposals to move Election Day to the weekend, or make it  a federal holiday , but they've gone nowhere. The good folks who put together the Constitution nailed down a lot of things, but the  exact definition of a natural born citizen   wasn't one of them. There's the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, the Socialist Workers Party, even something called the Legal Marijuana Now Party. In America, you get a sympathetic pat on the back and a ""you'll get 'em next time"" pep talk. It's complicated, so stay with us:  The  Electoral College  is  a group of people appointed by each party   The total number of electors is equal to the number of members in Congress:  538 Each state gets electors  based on its population . So, Wyoming has 3; New York has 29 So, if Candidate A wins the most votes in, say, New York, (s)he gets all 29 electoral votes. Because of this wacky system, a candidate can get ZERO votes in THIRTY-NINE  states and DC and  still  win the presidency. In a tie, one arm of Congress,  the House of Representatives , will elect the president, while the other,  the Senate , will elect the vice president. This year, if there's a tie in the Electoral College, and the Republicans keep the House but the Democrats win back the Senate, it's quite possible that we'd be looking at a  Donald Trump-Tim Kaine administration,  a fitting end to the wackiest election we've ever seen. The way the Electoral College works now is that most states are reliably either ""blue,"" meaning they  vote for the Democratic candidate , or ""red,"" meaning they  go with the Republican candidate. That leaves just a handful of states --  the battleground, or swing, states  -- that the candidates fight over, such as Florida. Both are colors in the American flag, and they look sharp on infographics because they're pretty much on opposite ends of the color spectrum. In 1980, states won by Republican Ronald Reagan were colored blue; Democrat Jimmy Carter's states were colored red. How could they, when there's private email servers and lewd hot-mic videos to discuss. Clinton : She wants to use  diplomacy and development  to quell problems abroad, stand by US allies, and stand her ground with rivals such as Russia and China. Clinton:  She wants to  combat climate change  and boost renewable energies, cut waste and reduce the United States' dependency on oil. If it all comes down to Ohio -- wouldn't be the first time -- and Trump and Clinton are pretty much tied, the whole thing could ride on  absentee and provisional ballots . In the last presidential election some 129 million votes were cast, so just think about the  large scale of votes  you'd have to manipulate to even have an effect. It's probably a lot easier to just pick up a campaign sign, stand on a street corner and try to convince people that your candidate's the better option. You know, it's called  democracy . Well, sure, a candidate could, but  it's not so simple . Remember, America really doesn't have a national election as much as  a series of state elections . Back in the old days, the president was inaugurated  on March 20 . It's kind of like that old Prince song: 2016, nothing compares to you. And yet you  don't hear much buzz about it , probably because Clinton herself rarely mentions it. Clinton's email problems were kind of fading into the background, then  came roaring back . Hey, if we knew the answer to that one, we'd extend our prophetic talents to something much more worthwhile, like predicting lottery numbers."	12	5

Author JD Vance, author of a new book ""Hillbilly Elegy"" on the working class white voters that form Trump's constituency, said the Republican nominee's supporters don't believe he is losing. ""I think a lot of folks think that the polls don't reflect reality,"" Vance said on CNN's ""Smerconish"" on Saturday. The key Republican interest group is throwing money behind an ad backing Ayotte in New Hampshire, telling voters they must send her back to Washington to act as a check on the White House -- with the clear implication that Clinton will be president. CNN's Jeff Zeleny reported on Sunday that Clinton had already reached out to some Republican senators, including allies from her days on Capitol Hill, saying she hopes to work with them to govern. Clinton's team is also looking at expanding the electoral map in search of a more decisive victory than polls suggest is on the cards, moving into Arizona and considering a run at Utah -- states that are typically solid GOP territory."	71	6

Elizabeth Warren: Trump thinks 'a mouth full of Tic Tacs' means he can 'force himself on any woman' Earlier this month, Ayotte  said during a debate  that she would ""absolutely"" point to her party's nominee as a role model for children -- remarks that drew immediate criticism and that Ayotte swiftly walked back, saying she ""misspoke."" Clinton's focus on down-ballot races marks a stark contrast from even a few weeks ago, when the former secretary of state was solely focused on her own race, including raising money and preparing for three general election debates against Trump."	21	5

""Wisconsin Democrats have competitive races to win across the state and Hillary Clinton is committed to electing Russ Feingold and Democrats up and down the ballot to help her make a real difference for families in Wisconsin,"" said Clinton state director Jake Hajdu. The buys could represent some concern about Clinton's performance in the state, but could also be merely a luxury investment given the $62 million in the campaign's coffers as of Oct. 20. Some polls have shown Johnson's support growing, and the super PAC aligned with Democratic leadership, Senate Majority PAC, said Friday that they would begin a $2 million campaign in the state on Monday after being absent from the airwaves."	96	2

A Randall County voter recalled her own mishap in a Facebook post on Monday, saying that she tried to cast a straight Republican ballot -- including a vote for Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence -- but wound up inadvertently selecting the Democratic ticket of Clinton and Tim Kaine. Frank Phillips, the elections administrator in Arlington's Tarrant County,  said  that his investigation ""indicated that the voter did not follow the directions for straight-party voting."" Randall County uses the Hart Intercivic eSlate for its elections, an electronic system that allows voters to turn a wheel and push a button to indicate preferences, and Lackey said those machines ""work exactly as intended."" Lackey also pointed out that the Randall County woman behind the viral Facebook post never alleged corruption, and she made it clear that she was able to correct her vote before officially casting the ballot. Georgia machine suspected of 'flipping' votes In Georgia, a voting machine in Bryan County was removed from service after the  Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper reported  to election officials that it may have been ""flipping"" some voters' choices for president. The Bryan County Board of Elections said in a statement that all machines were successfully tested ahead of this cycle's elections, and it was not immediately known why the machine in question wasn't initially working. He added that this particular machine had been used by about 20 other voters on Tuesday, but because of confidentiality rules, it's impossible to say whether other ballots were miscast, though he said no other voters reported problems."	6	1

Tears flowed Much of the seating at Clinton's remarks was for staff and aides and the campaign was treating it as a farewell to the people who have spent the better part of two years working on her behalf, an aide said. It also marked what could be the final act on the national stage of the Clinton double act, the political partnership between Bill Clinton and the former first lady and secretary of state that had seemed poised for a remarkable comeback, 16 years after they left the White House. Campaign staffers had spoken throughout Clinton's presidential bid of the extreme pressure many of them felt in facing Trump, whom Clinton argued was temperamentally and intellectually unfit for the presidency and to be in charge of the US nuclear arsenal. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Wednesday that she was with Trump when Abedin, called to say her boss wanted to talk to the president-elect.	39	5

Feeding off the Clinton machine, the Democratic Party has become riddled with lobbyists, billionaires, and hustlers who pocket huge sums of money by running either nonprofit ""think tanks"" or election-cycle networks, and politicians who, indeed, are focused mostly on reelection. Many times, including during two national debates, he pointed out that, while he was proud as a son of immigrants to be an American, this country has supported repressive dictators, sent the CIA on missions to help overthrow democratically elected governments that were not supportive enough of our interests and sent our young men and women to die in immoral wars."	51	4

I say ""bitter,"" because fresh blood was still flowing from the wounds inflicted by Donald Trump's army; I say ""sweet,"" because the quality of Kaine's and Clinton's speeches as they faced defeat reminded some of us of the resilience of the human spirit. In his remarks, Kaine recited one of  Hughes' youthful poems, ""Dreams"":   Hold fast to dreams For if dreams die Life is a broken-winged bird That cannot fly. Since Hughes' poem makes no allusion to politics or racism, we can take it at face value as a lyric meditation on our need to resist despair when facing life's vicissitudes -- those troubles from which no one, no matter how privileged, is exempt. Nevertheless, it is difficult to know that a young black man composed it during some of the worst years of Jim Crow in America and not see it at once as a political rallying cry despite its sentimentality. Martin Luther King Jr. would pick up on Hughes' dream imagery in his most celebrated oration, which we remember for its recurrent assertion ""I Have a Dream."" One is reminded also of Hughes' militant anthem of the Great Depression, ""Let America Be America Again,"" which appeared in 1936: (America ""never was America to me,"" and yet America ""must be."") Introducing Clinton, Kaine paired the sentimentality of Hughes with something much more muscular, and even menacing. It's a strange turnaround, and an odd application of the deeper lessons of the Civil War, but one that makes sense. Kaine was reminding his and Clinton's people that their election loss was only one setback, like Bull Run, when the South routed Union forces and terrified many people in the North, but it is not the end of the war. In a paradoxical reprising of what took place in America in the 1860s, the remarkable courage of the rebel South is there to be invoked and emulated in what his and Clinton's supporters must often see as a primal battle, a new civil war, for the soul and state of America."	78	6

Over time, I learned that it was not merely a pause to remember the victims, but a recognition of the work of so many in the immediate aftermath and how the government response to the Virginia Tech shooting was an example of how to get it right. Kaine, mindful of how politics can quickly surround such a tragedy -- an  even bigger problem today --  issued a stern warning  following the Virginia Tech shooting, ""To those who want to make this into some sort of crusade, I say take this elsewhere."""	34	4

The Senate approved a procedural motion on a 67-to-32 vote and will move soon to formal debate on the bill, which could start immediately, if there is cooperation and agreement.

16 3 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/politics/rand-paul-opposes-mike-pompeo-gina-haspel/index.html	GOP senator says he will oppose Pompeo and Haspel, complicating their paths to confirmation 	11	1	2	" Washington (CNN) Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said Wednesday that he intends to oppose President Donald Trump's nominations of Mike Pompeo as secretary of state and Gina Haspel as the next CIA director, complicating their confirmation process in the Senate where Republicans have a very slim majority. ""I'm perplexed by the nominations of people who loved the Iraq War so much they advocate for war with Iran,"" Paul told reporters on Capitol Hill in explaining his opposition to the nominees. Paul sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where Republicans hold a one-seat advantage, so if Paul carries out his threat to vote ""no"" on Pompeo -- and all Democrats vote against him -- Senate Republican leaders would need to decide if they would move the nominations to the floor without committee approval. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said that nominees can be reported out of committee for a floor vote with or without a recommendation -- and even with a negative recommendation. Republicans hold a narrow 51-49 advantage in the Senate, so Paul's opposition -- and possible opposition to Haspel from Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain -- means Republicans might need to rely on some support from Democrats. About Pompeo and Haspel, Paul said at his news conference their support for the Iraq War and Haspel's ""joyful glee"" of waterboarding prompted his move. Paul's comments are a reference to Haspel  being a CIA veteran who was intricately involved in the execution of George W. Bush-era CIA interrogation programs , including those carried out at a ""black site"" prison she reportedly ran. Paul said he has not spoken to the President about his opposition to Pompeo and Haspel, and that while he does support the President and his policies, ""Most of the people being appointed are still in favor of Iraq War,"" Paul said. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, a member of the committee, predicted both Haspel and Pompeo will be confirmed and added that shoring up stability at the top of the State Department needs to happen quickly. New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, one of two Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that voted last year to confirm Pompeo to be CIA director, told CNN she now has ""concerns."" Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the other Democrat on the committee who voted a year ago for Pompeo, told CNN on Wednesday he has ""a lot of concerns"" about elevating him to be secretary of state. While GOP leaders could still move the nomination to the full Senate for a vote -- where Pompeo might be able to get at least 51 votes to be confirmed -- failing to be approved by the committee could politically damage him, especially when an influential Democrat like Kaine who once backed him turns negative."	61	4

Sen.

In case it is not clear from her bracket, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto hails from the great state of Nevada. She proudly (look at all those exclamation points) supports her alma mater, the University of Nevada at the top. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio makes is kind of difficult to see who he actually chose to win, but it looks like he chose home state favorite, No. Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Illinois, stays loyal to the Midwest, choosing Indiana's Purdue University to win (out of a Final Four that also includes Michigan State). Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-New York, kept his bracket pretty safe, with a  wild  Final Four of three No. Republican Sen. John Thune didn't tweet his bracket, but he tweeted something so much better: well wishes for the South Dakota State basketball teams, accompanied by a GIF of Will Ferrell banging a cowbell. Not letting Congress have all the fun, President Barack Obama and former FBI Director James Comey also shared their brackets. Embracing an equal opportunity chance to have his dreams dashed, Obama filled out both a men's and women's tournament bracket. The best part of the former FBI director's bracket is in the East region, where he straight up doesn't choose a winner in Arkansas versus Butler because he's clearly already decided Purdue would steamroll its way into his Elite Eight. Odds are everyone's bracket will be busted after the end of the first round, so really nothing matters.	2	3

Following Dowd's remarks, Sen. Patrick Leahy again demanded Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley hold a hearing on what he called the politicization of the Justice Department. ""In the last few hours the President's personal attorney has called for the Justice Department, without even an arguably legitimate basis, to prematurely shut down the special counsel's Russia investigation,"" the Vermont Democrat said in a statement. ""And the attorney general, in a clear violation of his promised recusal under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee, fired a career civil servant days before he could retire, following months of the President's relentless and outrageous prodding."" Leahy sent a letter to Grassley in late January asking the Iowa senator to hold a hearing on the attacks on FBI and its leaders, writing: ""Never before have I been more concerned for the institutions we rely on to maintain our government's integrity than I am today."" ""Mr. Dowd's comments are yet another indication that the first instinct of the President and his legal team is not to cooperate with special counsel Mueller, but to undermine him at every turn,"" the New York Democrat said in the statement. ""The President, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel's investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans.""

Clinton, President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, first lady Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton will headline what will be her final rally together Monday night in Philadelphia, an aide said Thursday. The rally, which is expected to be one of Clinton's biggest of the campaign, acknowledges the importance of Pennsylvania -- and the Philadelphia area -- to Clinton's campaign. The key for Clinton is to boost turnout in Philadelphia, especially among African-American voters, and in city's surrounding suburbs. Tim Kaine, Clinton's vice presidential nominee, will be campaigning elsewhere, the aide said. The aide said the Monday night event would not necessarily be Clinton's final event, but it is unlikely that Clinton will hold a rally on Election Day.

Appearing on the ""Alan Colmes Show,"" Kaine said, ""I've really despaired  in the last few days seeing some of these comments, when people are throwing the impeachment word around before the election has even taken place. I mean, first it kind of suggests a little bit of defeatism, like, 'Well, we think we're probably going to lose,'"" Kaine said. As CNN's KFILE has reported, impeaching Clinton if she wins has been discussed on conservative talk radio with several Republican congressmen, with many saying a Clinton win could result in ""constitutional crisis"" if Clinton were indicted as a result of the pending FBI review of emails obtained from her top aide Huma Abedin. Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who is facing a tough re-election in California, shot down the idea on Wednesday, and a top Republican in the Senate, John Cornyn, called such discussions ""premature."""	5	1

Speaking to reporters at the weekly Republican leadership news conference Wednesday, Ryan defined Democrat Conor Lamb as a ""pro-life, pro-gun, anti-Nancy Pelosi conservative"" and noted that there wasn't a Democratic primary that would have pulled Lamb to the left. While the Wisconsin Republican argued Republicans need to focus on their legislative track record in Congress and avoid being outraised, he still said he doubts this will become a trend in Republican-leaning districts because there wasn't a primary. He said he supports abortion rights but personally opposes abortion -- a position that matches Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee. He toed the Democratic line on health care, aired advertisements opposing Ryan-backed reforms to Medicare and Social Security, and hammered the Republican tax bill, arguing it would balloon the deficit and lead to cuts to entitlement programs. Asked by CNN if this  should also be ""a wakeup call"" to the President , Ryan argued that Trump helped make the race as close as it is. ""I think the President helped close this race,"" he said, a reference to the campaigning Trump did in the district over the previous weekend. The public polling wasn't looking so good and the President came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now, which is within a few hundred votes."" While he took a few questions on the race, Ryan appeared to grow tired of talking about Pennsylvania. As one reporter toward the end started to ask another question about the race, Ryan moved on to a different reporter. There was some crosstalk and laughter, but ultimately Ryan never answered the question and took questions on an upcoming appropriations fight instead. Republican leaders also touted the tax reform plan and sought to portray how taxpayers would be affected if Democrats took control and passed their own tax plan."	20	7

27 2 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/gun-control-congress-debate/index.html	The path on guns is narrow, but emerging  	11	1	2	"  (CNN) Key bipartisan senators worked to secure an agreement Tuesday that could allow for several votes on gun-related amendments possibly next week, even as most of the proposals being discussed face long odds in Congress. ""I think we can work this,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut who was seen in a lengthy discussion on the Senate floor Tuesday with Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. Cornyn also said that they were trying to find a way to bring legislation that would incentivize state and federal agencies to enter more information into  the country's background check database -- known as ""Fix NICs""  -- to the floor. ""It requires consent,"" Cornyn said, noting that the debate likely wouldn't begin until after this week. Gun control efforts hit headwinds  Earlier in the day, it appeared  Republicans on Capitol Hill were steering the debate away from proposals to restrict gun purchases toward plans to beef up school security after the latest mass shooting at a Florida high school. While a group of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school  made the rounds pressing top leaders from both parties  to move legislation to ban assault-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips, expand background checks and raise the age for purchases of rifles, there is no appetite in either the GOP-controlled House or Senate to move any significant gun control bills. ""We had a considerable discussion about the school safety issue at lunch ... the view of the vast majority of my conference is that we should make progress on bills that we agree on,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters at the Capitol House Speaker Paul Ryan stressed his long held position on Tuesday morning that Congress  shouldn't be ""banning guns for law abiding citizens."" Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who supports a measure to ban fire bump stocks and expand background checks, argued there were a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill who would not be satisfied with narrow actions. Ryan and other leaders pointed out that the House  already approved a narrowly created measure  to patch up holes in the background check database, and urged the Senate to take action on that bill. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, said he and other conservatives are preparing to unveil a package of proposals to beef up security in schools that could cost billions. He said the price tag for the proposal would be ""substantial,"" noting that ""it would start with a 'B,' not an 'M,'"" and that ""making our schools safe is something that I think all members of the Congress and the Senate are united in. More concerns from the Senate  Across the Capitol, Republican senators huddled for their weekly policy luncheon, but while members said they had a good discussion on guns, few seemed ready to act on any major proposals. Sen. Patrick Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who pushed for a plan to expand background checks back in 2013, said he'd had promising conversations with some members about garnering support for his bill again, but he wasn't definitive he'd be able to get the votes. It appeared the only thing that had some support was Cornyn's Fix NICs bill, but even that has hit snags on both sides of the aisle. Democrats demand more  While many Democrats have supported the Fix NICs bill, which would incentivize federal and state authorities to enter more data into the country's background check system, Democrats argue it's not enough on its own. Not just on Fix NICs but on legislation that would really do the job,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday. ""Passing a bill that is common sense even if it wouldn't have been the bill that would have prevented previous tragedy, isn't a reason not to pass the bill,"" Costello said."	90	2
5 11 2016	https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/opinions/impeach-hillary-clinton-talk-is-wacky-opinion-amar/index.html	Impeach Hillary Clinton? A boon for Democrats	11	1	2	 (CNN) Several leading Republicans are  suggesting  that if Hillary Clinton is elected, she could be  impeached  sometime after inauguration, perhaps in her first year as president. Echoing these allies, Donald Trump is arguing that a prospect of  impeachment  over the Clinton email controversy or any other Clinton misdeed would mire America in a  constitutional crisis,  and thus he (and  he alone ) is America's salvation. So by giving Clinton a good excuse to boost Kaine, Republicans would be making their own prospects that much harder in future presidential elections, and doubly so -- by looking (and being) themselves extreme and partisan and by making Kaine look (and be) all the more presidential. Once we understand how a clever President Clinton would and should react to overheated Republican extremists, we see how Trump and his allies are -- as they so often are -- mistaken in their bullheaded constitutional claims.	99	4

26 1 2018	https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/26/politics/immigration-border-wall-daca-trump-congress/index.html	Forget the wall, Trump's plan would reshape US legal immigration dramatically	11	1	2	" In addition, the administration proposal included a number of ""legal loopholes"" it wants to close in the border security pillar beyond physical security -- a repackaged effort to expand federal immigration authorities. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is part of a bipartisan Senate group working to find common ground on the issue, had said earlier Thursday that while a full border wall is not acceptable, a major investment in border security is. Thorny proposals The White House proposal would limit family sponsorship to spouses and minor children, eliminating a number of existing categories including adult children, both married and unmarried; parents of adult US citizens; and siblings of adult US citizens. At first, the Trump proposal would use the green cards from the eliminated categories -- plus the 50,000 from the eliminated diversity visa lottery -- to work through a backlog of millions of people waiting in a line upward of 30 years long for their green cards. And the framework includes vague references to closing ""legal loopholes,"" as a White House official put it on a briefing call, as part of the border security pillar -- perhaps one of the biggest poison pills of the deal. ""I am a lot less interested in things that have the effect of distorting family relationships or splitting up families, and border security is less likely to do that,"" said Democrat Michael Bennet of Colorado, who has long pursued an immigration compromise."	93	2

Haley's tweet stands in contrast to her disapproval of a comedy skit during the Grammy Awards last week, which featured Hillary Clinton ""auditioning"" to perform the audio version of Michael Wolff's bombshell book about President Donald Trump.

Joseph Kennedy III, a potential rising star in the Democratic Party, will get a huge platform and a plum political assignment when he delivers  the response to President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address  on Tuesday. Long dubbed the ""curse"" of the State of the Union response,  lawmakers tasked with following the grandiose speech from the President  have struggled to counter with the same gravitas, and some seem to have jinxed their own political aspirations down the road. However, in more immediate memory, Cathy McMorris Rodgers (2014) still holds her leadership slot in the House, Joni Ernst (2015) holds her Senate seat and Nikki Haley (2016) now serves as US ambassador to the United Nations. Sen. Marco Rubio (2013) Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida gave the Republican rebuttal to the State of the Union address in 2013 after his election to the Senate in 2010. He launched a bid for the White House in 2016, withdrawing from the campaign after losing his home state of Florida that March to sitting President Donald Trump. Rep. Paul Ryan (2011) A then-rising star in GOP politics, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, then the new chair of the House budget panel, was selected to give the State of the Union response in 2011. The next year, when presidential nominee Mitt Romney chose him as his running mate, Ryan lost the vice presidential race. Gov. Bob McDonnell (2010) The Virginia governor gave the GOP State of the Union response just days after being sworn into office in Virginia, but McDonnell's post-office life has been plagued by scandal. Gov. He ran for president in 2016, ending his campaign before reaching the Iowa caucuses after frequently hitting 1% or lower in primary polling. Sen. Jim Webb (2007) Democratic Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia gave the 2007 response to the State of the Union address after his election in 2006. But after that, he ruled himself out of Obama's vice presidential speculation in 2008, didn't run for re-election in 2012 and flopped in a bid for the White House in 2016 after memorably talking onstage at a presidential debate about killing an enemy soldier. Gov. Tim Kaine (2006) Tim Kaine gave the State of the Union rebuttal in 2006 as the governor of Virginia. Sen. Tom Daschle (2004) Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota gave the State of the Union response in 2004.

His counterpart in the address, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, had better luck, going on to become the first female speaker of the House. Rep.

Tom Foley (1992) Former House Speaker Tom Foley gave the Democratic State of the Union response in 1990 and 1992 under President George H.W.

(CNN) This week, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke in Congress for eight hours straight about immigrant youth. Yet, while she was speaking, Democratic and Republican party leaders  were writing a budget deal  that would leave protections for immigrant youth out in exchange for dollars on other projects. At a CNN town hall one year ago, House Speaker  Paul Ryan told my friend Angelica  that she would be safe, yet we now live in danger of being picked up and taken to detention centers by Donald Trump's Immigration and Customs Enforcement squads. And Thursday night, Nancy Pelosi failed to whip her caucus to use its leverage to protect us, as 73 Democrats voted with Republicans for the budget deal and secured nothing from Paul Ryan. In this leadership moment, where they had their opportunity to fight back against Trump's racist policies,  the Democrats stood down  and the deportations continue to escalate. Immigrant youth and our allies in cities, towns, and states across the country have generated bipartisan, broad and deep support for passage of the Dream Act in Congress. As ICE and Border Patrol agents board buses and trains to ask citizens and non-citizens alike for their papers, as children are dragged to detention camps and thousands of immigrant youth lose their jobs and become vulnerable, one has to wonder what it will take. Since Trump announced last fall that he was ending the DACA program,  more than 19,000 immigrant youth  have lost their protections from deportation, 850 more lose it every week and on March 5, Trump has decided that it will end for all of us. Just weeks ago at the Women's March, I watched former Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine speak of his admiration for immigrant youth to great applause. Immigrant youth, people of color, faith leaders, women and millions of allies are putting our bodies on the line every day to resist Trump and fight for a better and fairer country. Leader Pelosi, House Democrats and the Republicans who say they stand with immigrant youth and the promise of Lady Liberty have a decision to make.	28	2

The ACA has many strengths: it expanded health coverage for over  20 million Americans , it protects Americans with preexisting conditions, and it draws on ideas from across the political spectrum like expanding Medicaid and enabling young adults under 26 to stay on their parents' health insurance plans. It would use the Medicare provider network, reimbursement schedule, and low administrative cost to deliver a high-quality product at a reasonable price that could be purchased on the individual insurance exchange. Starting in 2020, Medicare-X would become available to every individual in areas with one or fewer private plans on the individual market.	58	3

""It's amazing how magically, suddenly things appear,"" Florida Democrat Bill Nelson said when asked about criticism that Democrats and bipartisan negotiations have yet to produce a deal with 60 votes. Finger pointing The process got off to an inauspicious start on Monday night, when the Senate cleared a procedural hurdle to move toward opening debate on the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, as had been promised for weeks by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. But just outside the Senate chamber, Republican leadership  told reporters that the debate would get only a week  of floor time -- a move to pressure Democrats to produce their legislative proposals. Democrats and some Republicans had anticipated possible weeks of debate -- and little legislation has been finalized and introduced on either side yet that would deal with DACA, a program that protected young undocumented immigrants from deportation that President Donald Trump is ending, and any other provisions on immigration. Instead of then moving straight into a vote to open debate, the Senate spent Tuesday arguing about next steps, with Democrats accusing Republicans of tampering with the procedure and Republicans accusing Democrats of dilatory tactics because they had nothing to offer. The finger pointing spilled onto the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon, when McConnell moved to consider an amendment that would have dealt with sanctuary cities -- a favorite target of Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York objected, asking instead that the body move to consider  a bill largely resembling the White House proposal  -- a pathway to citizenship for DACA eligible immigrants, a hefty border security request, substantially curtailing family-based migration and ending the diversity visa lottery -- in conjunction with  a proposal from Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware  that would pair DACA with a comprehensive review of border security. ""So if our leader wants to call that (sanctuary cities) amendment up, I mean, eventually we'll get to (the White House framework), but there are others we want to process as well, but I'm not sure why you would block even moving to the initial consideration of amendments, which is what the Democrats are currently doing. Democrats were tight-lipped coming out of the meeting -- Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland confirmed they were going over proposals on immigration and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said they were ""making progress,"" but all refused to go into further detail."	23	6

Overall, the Democrat won nearly 68% of the vote, eclipsing the 64% mark set by Hillary Clinton in last year's presidential race and easily exceeding the 57% that Warner captured in 2014 and the 58% that Democrat Terry McAuliffe scored when he won the 2013 gubernatorial contest. Moreover, turnout rose in Northern Virginia in relation to the rest of the state: the region, which includes Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William Counties, and the Democratic bastion of Alexandria, accounted for roughly 30% of the statewide vote, up from 28% in the 2013 governor's race. Gillespie's 31% showing in Fairfax, the largest vote-producing county in the state, is not only less than his 40% tally in 2014, it's less than the 36% that Republican Ken Cuccinelli, a conservative hard-liner, garnered in the 2013 gubernatorial contest.	74	5

Consider Loudoun County near Washington: Democrats won it by 5 points in the 2013 governor's race, and 20 points on Tuesday. It could also accelerate the pace of Republican retirements, as Republican Bob McDonnell's win in the 2009 Virginia governor's race did for Democrats. Republicans lost the culture war Beyond the governor's race, Democrats won a decisive victory on the social and cultural issues that have dominated Virginia politics. One of the biggest forces in the Virginia races was Planned Parenthood, which helped Democrats defeat a Republican lieutenant governor nominee, Jill Vogel, who as a state senator had pushed a bill requiring women seeking abortions to undergo vaginal ultrasounds. And in the Virginia attorney general's race, incumbent Democrat Mark Herring cruised despite Republican John Adams' attacks on Herring's decision not to defend the state's same-sex marriage ban in court. Obama and Biden help Democrats The Democratic Party lost about 1,000 state legislative seats during Obama's presidency across the country -- eight years in which Democratic strategists howled about the White House's inattention to the party's crumbling infrastructure and its down-ballot disasters. And Obama's rallies in New Jersey and Virginia, which drew thousands to hear his lectures that the party's base had gotten ""complacent"" in non-presidential elections, appear to have energized the minority voters that Northam's campaign had worried might stay at home. While the northern Virginia results will get the most national attention, Northam ran up his lead throughout Virginia's entire urban crescent -- stretching from the Washington suburbs through Norfolk. Swaggering onto stage at Northam's victory party to Mark Morrison's ""Return of the Mack,"" McAuliffe cast the election results as Virginia's rejection of discrimination."	33	1

Meanwhile, they complained, the US has made no major change to its ties to Myanmar (also known as Burma), and its officials have shied away from legal terms such as ""ethnic cleansing"" or ""crimes against humanity"" despite what many say is strong evidence. ""In recent weeks, we've also witnessed the appalling images of atrocities being committed by the Burmese military against  the Rohingya minority ,"" said Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, at a hearing Tuesday to examine the US policy toward Myanmar. Murphy, who had earlier in the day testified about policy towards Myanmar before Corker's committee, was asked by reporters about the State Department's consideration of terms like ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity or genocide. Lawmakers in the House and Senate have proposed a series of new sanctions on Myanmar's military, which, Corker noted, ""continues to control key ministries and large swaths of the economy,"" even after a 2015 election brought the democratic opposition to power and with it, activist Aung San Suu Kyi, who is now the country's de factor leader. ""Her failure to acknowledge the seemingly systematic campaign of brutality by the Burmese military continues to undermine the civilian government and Burma's democratic transition as a whole,"" said Corker, describing his ""shock and dismay at her dismissiveness"" of concerns about what has been happening to Rohingya. Murphy said that Trump has discussed this situation with other leaders, that Tillerson had spoken by phone with Suu Kyi to urge action on this crisis, that Pence and US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley had denounced the military's response at the UN, and that the US ambassador in Myanmar has been discussing the violence with government and military leaders. US officials have pointed out that ""these kind of abuses, this kind of displacement,"" not only threatens the transition to democracy, but it ""creates a much bigger risk for the attraction of international terrorism"" if the plight of the Rohingya becomes a rallying cry for militant Islamic groups, Murphy said. Pushed by Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the committee, to say that ethnic cleansing is taking place, Murphy said that he wasn't in a position to make that determination, but that it was under consideration."	100	7

The full House and Senate will receive separate classified, members-only briefings from Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Joe Dunford and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. Trump's call for more US troops with greater authority to attack the Taliban and other militant groups was praised by Republicans for committing US forces to winning the war in Afghanistan, but Democrats criticized the President for lacking a strategy and not providing details like the number of US additional troops that would deploy. After the North's latest missile test that flew over Japan, US B-1B bombers and F-35B fighter jets joined with South Korean F-15 fighter jets in a  joint flyover  of the Korean Peninsula as a show of force. Some lawmakers have expressed concern that Trump could launch a preemptive military strike against North Korea, but there's  not a lot Congress could do  to tie the President's hands short of explicitly barring military action, which is not likely to be considered. Mattis and Tillerson briefed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the issue before the August recess, and the panel's chairman Bob Corker has expressed openness to debating a draft authorization in committee that's authored by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona. But the first item on the Senate's agenda will be the defense authorization bill, which could be the vehicle for a number of contentious debates over military policy. Democrats  are preparing  to try to reverse Trump's proposed ban on with an amendment to the defense bill, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York has been sounding out moderate Republicans to find a provision that they could support. After that, there's still no clear path forward on a budget agreement to lift defense spending, and this fall the military is facing the  most budget uncertainty  that it's seen in years."	72	6

And freshman California Sen. Kamala Harris was given a seat on the intelligence committee, where the panel's must-see Russia hearings have already given a serious boost to her national profile. While the intelligence committee typically operates behind closed doors, the panel's investigation into Russia's election interference has vaulted it into the most high-profile congressional committee this year, and Harris' prosecutorial style was in the spotlight after she was interrupted twice by Chairman Richard of North Carolina Burr and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans. Warren: Massachusetts Institute of (Military) Technology Warren's move to the Armed Services Committee this year sparked already mounting speculation that she's gearing up for a 2020 presidential run, as foreign policy is the biggest hole in her presidential resume. Booker has raised the same concerns as Warren on the Trump administration's proposal to slash budgets for the State Department and US Agency for International Development, arguing they are just as important as the military in the fight against ISIS. Booker has not asked questions at nearly two-thirds of the foreign relations panel's hearings, including when Tillerson came back to the committee in June to discuss the State Department's budget. As for Harris' foreign policy positions, the intelligence committee doesn't provide a platform like the Armed Services and Foreign Relations panels, but some of her worldview does come through, including concerns about military spending.	32	1

This is the story of Election Day in 2016, from the last gasp campaign events, to the heady (for Clinton) early hours and glorious (for Trump) evening. LAST GASP CNN producer Betsy Klein: ""I was the pool reporter for the networks the day before election day, and Tim Kaine had a midnight rally at his hometown in Richmond after a full day of campaign events (Raleigh, Charlotte, and Wilmington, NC, then to Fairfax, VA). CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jeff Zeleny: ""More than three hours before sunrise, Hillary Clinton's blue and white campaign plane landed in White Plains, New York, after one final rally. ET, Clinton's last frenetic day of campaigning was over. 'It's the most humbling feeling,' Clinton said, reflecting on the history of her campaign for one of the first times. After years of covering Clinton, it was one of the first times I remember thinking she feels like she is going to win -- and make history."" He held an early event in Miami, looking forward to Florida's contest, and the auditorium was totally empty long before polls closed so Sanders could give a speech before losing the night, common practice for a campaign expecting a primary loss. ET, the safe prediction that Clinton would win started to fade as Trump's strength in Florida, North Carolina and the Midwest showed he was very much in this race. I noticed that while Hillary Clinton was winning in those three counties, I began to think her margins wouldn't be enough to carry the state. CNN Producer Dan Merica ""Clinton's pool of reporters loaded up into the vans and made the trip into Manhattan, where we would be posted up at her campaign hotel - The Peninsula New York -- for the rest of the night. Clinton would remain ensconced in a suite at the top of the hotel, while the pool of reporters sat in a conference room (featuring two roll away beds) to watch the results with a small group of Clinton campaign staffers. Anand, the Clinton campaign's press wrangler, had worked his way up from an intern in Clinton's office, giving his life over to the campaign for two years. It was the first time that night that a Clinton campaign staffer, with any seriousness, acknowledged that Trump was on the verge of winning. CLOCK STRIKES 12 THE CALL, AND THE CALL CNN Producer Cassie Spodak   ""I watched John Podesta speak around 2 a.m. and than caught a cab across town to Trump's election night party at the Hilton to try and interview the supporter I had been shadowing."	32	3

Rand Paul is likely to secure a vote on ending the war authorizations the US military uses to fight terrorism across the globe. Paul's office announced he would get a vote Wednesday on the Kentucky Republican's amendment that would repeal the 2001 and 2002 war authorizations after six months, giving Congress time to pass a new Authorization for Use of Military Force for the wars against Al Qaeda, ISIS and the Taliban. Senate leaders appear to have agreed to give Paul a vote on his amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act after he threatened to object to all other amendments, which would have effectively prevented any amendments from getting a vote on the massive defense policy bill. Paul's amendment likely faces an uphill climb to be adopted onto the defense bill, as many lawmakers have expressed concern about repealing the authorization the US military uses to fight ISIS and Al Qaeda without first replacing it. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has joined forces with Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona to draft a new war authorization, says he's likely to back Paul's amendment. In the House, the appropriations committee approved an amendment from California Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee to repeal the 2001 AUMF, but House Republican leaders used a procedural tactic to strip the amendment before the defense appropriations bill passed on the floor. If Paul drops his objections to other amendments -- and no other senators raise their own -- there are a number of other contentious issues that might get votes on the defense policy bill, although there are hundreds of amendments that have been offered. And Sen. Tom Cotton has proposed an amendment that would end the sequestration budget caps for both defense and non-defense spending, which as currently written would prevent the Pentagon's proposed $54 billion budget increase from taking shape."""	99	3

Flanked at first by New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Sanders called the costs of the current system ""insane and unaffordable,"" promising that the average family would benefit financially under his plan ""because you will no longer be writing checks to private insurance companies."" Taking her turn, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren framed the push for single payer as the latest step in a long liberal project to expand access to medical care -- from Franklin Roosevelt's social security to Medicare and Medicaid under Lyndon Johnson and, most recently, Barack Obama's signature legislation. Sanders' plan, though dead-on-arrival in a Republican-controlled Congress, offers a blueprint for fundamentally reshaping the American health care system by moving the country to a government-run, single-payer program. Under Sanders' proposal, Americans would receive a ""Universal Medicare card"" that would be a ticket to comprehensive health care services, including hospital stays, doctor visits, substance abuse treatment, dental, vision and reproductive care -- including abortion. While the new legislation has not yet been scored, the program Sanders pitched on the campaign trail came with an estimated annual price tag of nearly $1.4 trillion, to be paid for in part by a proposed new 2.2% income tax on all Americans, a 6.2% levy on employers and a further round of tax hikes on the wealthy. ""This is an especially gratifying moment for the tens of thousands of nurses across the US who have dedicated years of effort to transform our health care system from an profiteering industry based on greed and suffering to patient need and healing,"" National Nurses United Executive Director RoseAnn DeMoro said in a statement. She called the bill's introduction a ""direct product of how Sen. Sanders made Medicare for all, and healthcare as a human right, such a signature issue of his campaign."""	0	2

But in an unusual move, Pompeo is already privately courting moderate Democratic senators who don't serve on that committee, in what lawmakers in both parties say is a sign of the significant challenges facing the nomination. Already, Pompeo has lost the support of Republican Rand Paul, a Kentucky senator who serves on the committee, which is a significant defection given the GOP's one-vote advantage on the panel. But both senators have been skeptical of Pompeo's nomination to State, as many Democrats raise concerns over his hawkish views and worry he won't be an independent voice willing to stand up to Trump. And in the event that all committee Democrats vote against his nomination and Paul votes ""no,"" Republicans would be forced to take procedural steps to advance the nomination to the floor without a recommendation from the panel, amounting to a rebuke to the nominee. But with a narrowly divided chamber,  Sen.

Weinstein is a longtime associate of the Clintons and a major Democratic Party donor who bundled funds for the party's political campaigns, including supporting both of Clinton's presidential bids. The allegations against Weinstein have renewed a debate about sexual harassment in the workplace and drawn attention to Clinton, the Democrats' 2016 standard-bearer who made the treatment of women a key plank of her presidential campaign. Representatives for the former secretary of state and former President Bill Clinton had  previously not responded  to requests for comment about Weinstein, whose ties to the Clintons go back years, from the Clinton presidency to the former first lady's successful campaign for Senate. Clinton's former running mate, Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine,  said on CNN  Tuesday morning that people should condemn Weinstein and said he anticipated Clinton would say something eventually. Besides supporting Obama's 2012 presidential bid as a bundler and maintaining his role in the Democratic Party, Weinstein appeared at the White House several times for formal and informal events, and the Obamas' eldest daughter, Malia, interned at the Weinstein Company.	38	4

Later Thursday, a Clinton aide said the former secretary of state will donate roughly $13,000 to a women's organization that has not yet been named.

Clinton said she had no idea that Weinstein acted that way in private, despite some in Hollywood saying that people close to him had known. Throughout Clinton's political career, Weinstein helped raise around $1.5 million for Democrats and associated groups by bundling donations, according to data from the campaign finance-tracking Center for Responsive Politics. ""I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein,"" Clinton said in a statement five days after the allegations broke, through her spokesman Nick Merrill."	18	3

Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has argued that the 2001 and 2002 war authorizations -- which were passed to authorize military action against Al Qaeda and in Iraq -- are hopelessly out of date as the military focuses on fighting ISIS across the Middle East, a group that didn't exist at that time. While Paul's amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was unsuccessful, he said it was a victory just to get the Senate to debate and take a vote on the war authorizations. But congressional leaders have been weary of passing a new war authorization, and House Republicans  stripped Lee's amendment  out of the defense appropriations bill when it was passed on the floor. Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine and Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake have  introduced a war authorization  that the Senate foreign relations committee may consider, which would also sunset the 2001 and 2002 war authorizations with a new five-year authorization for US military operations against ISIS, al Qaeda, the Taliban and ""associated"" forces. Flake, however, argued that he supported Paul's goal, but not his method of repealing the current war authorization without a new one in place. Senate foreign relations chairman Bob Corker said he agreed with Paul that Congress needs to take action on a new war authorization, but said he was opposed to the substance of Paul's effort."	73	6

What's remarkable about that silence is that Weinstein isn't, really, denying the allegations. In a long statement released in response to the Times story -- in which he quoted Jay Z and said he would take a leave of absence to focus on fighting the NRA --  Weinstein acknowledged : ""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it."" During the 2016 campaign, Weinstein held a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign at his New York City apartment and another with fashion mogul Anna Wintour. Malia Obama, the couple's daughter, interned at The Weinstein Company before starting college at Harvard this year. Despite repeated inquiries from reporters in search of comment about the allegations against Weinstein, the offices of the Clintons and Obamas have remained mum. At an  event at the University of California Davis promoting her book on Monday night , Clinton spoke for more than an hour but never mentioned Weinstein's name. It's also possible that Clinton and Obama believe that they are no longer active figures in day-to-day Democratic politics and, therefore, don't need to respond to every single news story out there."	87	3

In his 2006 op-ed, published six months after the Republican nominee in Virginia lost the governor's race and amid nationwide immigrant rights protests, Gillespie argued his long-held position that a comprehensive approach to immigration was needed that would address border security, toughen enforcement of existing immigration laws, and would allow ""illegal immigrants to earn legal status by working, learning English, paying taxes and living crime-free."" Gillespie, whose firm the Wall Street Journal noted at the time ""represents clients who support a temporary guest worker program,"" then argued that the path offered by populists would doom the Republican Party and pointed to last minute anti-illegal immigration  ads  run by former Republican gubernatorial nominee Jerry Kilgore in 2005, which Gillespie wrote might have cost Kilgore votes."	96	6

17 9 2017	https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/17/opinions/constitution-day-kaine/index.html	Tim Kaine: The founding fathers wanted you to be a (peaceful) activist	11	1	2	" The document was finalized in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787, and we celebrate that day every year as Constitution Day. And in 2017, so many do. From the Women's Marches across the country in January, to the spontaneous demonstrations against the President's ill-considered Muslim ban, to a flood of first-time candidates pledging to run for office, to a dramatic  uptick  in citizens reaching out to members of Congress by mail, phone, email and in person, we see that the civic roles assigned to us by James Madison and others still have vitality and purpose. Recall what had brought the drafters to this pivotal moment: They had lived through the pain and triumph of the Revolutionary War and then saw the nation founder in its initial years, its inadequate national government unable to bind together the states. And so the framers gathered to create a national government, with checks and balances to avoid abuses of power that they could easily foresee. The Constitution had many imperfections and we had to fight a war to correct the most egregious of them -- the embrace of slavery, in direct contradiction of the equality principle we professed in the Declaration of Independence. Congress is the Article 1 branch because the framers wanted the people's elected legislative body to be ""first among equals"" with a primacy over the President whose powers are described in Article 2. The federal judiciary created in Article 3 received the unusual guarantee of life tenure so they could face down actions of Congress or the President without fear for their jobs. The power to vote, thankfully expanded over time (though we have work to do to protect this right, as some try to erode it). The freedom to worship as one pleases and to express oneself, designed as much to prod society to progress as to protect the individual. And the power ""peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."" From the very beginning, the framers understood that the power of the people was not just limited to casting a ballot, but extended much more widely. But on this Constitution Day, I celebrate the role of the individual to vote, to speak, to peacefully protest and to shape, through civic activism, the direction of the country. It is this popular activism that stopped Congress from a disastrous one-party repeal of the Affordable Care Act, despite repeated votes to do so in the past. We saw the dead-end of violence in my state, as white supremacists brought hatred, bigotry, assault and even death to Charlottesville in August. We cannot tolerate violence by anyone, of any political viewpoint, if we truly embrace the principles expressed in the Constitution."	99	5

Here's a look, more than a year out, at the 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties in the November 2018 midterms:  1. Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller  Primary date: June 12 In a health care battle that hurt Republicans politically, Heller's reversals and contortions were uniquely damaging. On the right, Danny Tarkanian -- 0-for-5 in the general election in his runs for office but 4-for-5 in Republican primaries -- says Heller hasn't sufficiently supported Trump. On the left, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen says he's been there when Trump and congressional Republicans needed him. Missouri Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill Primary date: August 7 Running for re-election as a Democrat in a state Trump won by 19 points is tough enough. Now, McCaskill faces the challenger national Republicans had hoped to recruit into the race: state attorney general Josh Hawley, who officially launched his campaign last week. Worse news for McCaskill: At the outset, Hawley seems to have the backing of both the McConnell and Bannon crowds -- making a competitive primary that would siphon away resources less likely. Arizona Incumbent: Republican Sen. Jeff Flake Primary date: August 28 If the question was which senator is most likely to lose, Flake would be first -- by a lot. But Arizona still favors Republicans, and whoever emerges from the GOP's primary will stand a chance at keeping the seat -- even if it's Kelli Ward, whose history of controversial statements would be fodder for endless attack ads. But the possibility of other candidates entering before the late-August 2018 primary, and the bigger question of Sen. John McCain's health, add heavy doses of uncertainty to this race. Indiana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Primary date: May 8 Donnelly is a ripe target: He gambled entering the 2012 race against Sen. Richard Lugar, got lucky when Lugar lost in a primary to state treasurer Richard Mourdock, and then hit the jackpot when Mourdock flubbed a question about pregnancies resulting from rape in a debate just before the election. This is another race that features two major themes: (1) It's happening in a state where Trump cruised in 2016, and (2) Republicans are heading into what could be an expensive, brutal primary. West Virginia Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Primary date: May 8 It's getting lonely for Manchin in West Virginia. Like every other Democrat on this list, he's helped by Republicans failing to make him pay any price at all for voting against their bills. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Primary date: June 12 Want a 10-second explanation of why Trump drives Republicans whose job is to expand the party's Senate majority crazy? Ohio Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown Primary date: May 8 The 2016 election ended Ohio's status as the marquee swing state -- with Trump's eight-point margin of victory there making places like North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia look like potentially better targets for national Democrats. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Primary date: June 5 Tester is raising lots of money -- $1.2 million in the third quarter, with more than $5 million on hand -- and railing against ""Washington,"" not Trump. The GOP primary bears watching -- in part because it's shaping up as a proxy war between interior secretary Ryan Zinke, whose wife is involved with Troy Downing's campaign, and Sen. Steve Daines, who is aligned with state auditor Matt Rosendale. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin Primary date: August 14 Baldwin is all that's standing in the way of Republicans' total takeover of Wisconsin's statewide seats -- and she'll be on the ballot at the same time the engine that drove Gov. Honorable mention Two more Democrats, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, are among the safest swing-state incumbents. If a true anti-Trump wave breaks against the Republicans, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could find himself in a competitive race against Rep. Beto O'Rourke. And whichever Republican is nominated to replace Sen. Bob Corker in Tennessee -- right now, Rep. Marsha Blackburn looks like the front-runner -- could face a tough test. State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who nearly knocked off Sen. Thad Cochran in a primary in 2014, is seriously considering the race. Democrats wonder if the GOP primary might turn this state into competitive ground just like Alabama, where controversial former judge Roy Moore faces a surprisingly serious competitor in Democrat Doug Jones in a December special election."	56	2

But then, the Washington Post  reports , Manafort and Trump's delegates pushed back, orchestrating changes that deleted a call to provide arms to Ukraine to help it defend itself from Russian forces fighting on its territory. Other language, including increasing sanctions against Russia and noting that ""the post-Cold War ideal of a 'Europe whole and free' is being severely tested by Russia's military aggression,""  disappeared , even though they represented the view of the Republican foreign policy establishment. As President, Trump has the authority to declassify any material he wishes to, but the move -- revealing information provided by an ally without the ally's permission -- was shocking. Trump has gone out on a thin limb,  risking charges  of obstruction of justice to protect Mike Flynn, who lost his White House job after lying about contacts with Russians. Trump is eager  to move forward  on cooperation with Russia, as we saw after his meeting with Putin in Hamburg, but the cloud hanging over his administration has so far prevented policy reversals."	57	3

Kaine's comments follow a series of New York Times reports including one story Monday on an email sent to Trump Jr. last year stating that a Russian lawyer had ""compromising"" information about Hillary Clinton as ""part of a Russian government effort"" to help the Trump campaign. Sen. John Cornyn, a high-ranking Texas Republican on the committee, said of Trump Jr.'s comments, ""I don't think we have enough information to reach a conclusion but he certainly made himself a witness.""

A small group of lawmakers from both parties have long been pushing for Congress to pass a new authorization for the war against ISIS, and their effort received a jolt in the arm in June when a House panel  voted to repeal  the 2001 war authorization, a 60-word broad authorization approved just days after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.

The emails, taken at face value, appear to show a willingness by Trump Jr., a vital member of his father's political and business inner circle, to accept information purportedly from the government of Russia to help his father's presidential campaign. The lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, has denied she was a Russian government employee, but the emails appear to reveal that Trump Jr. took the meeting on the assumption that she did at least have government connections. Even the most charitable reading of the emails seems to lead to a conclusion that Trump Jr.'s decision to attend the meeting at all, and to get involved in an alleged international election intrigue, showed a staggering level of naiveté that reveals the Trump campaign's lack of experience on the political stage. Then came Tuesday's email dump, as Trump Jr. apparently tried to get ahead of a story in the works by The New York Times using the same material. Both the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort took part in the meeting with the Russian lawyer, according to Trump Jr.'s statement on Sunday. Family ties On a personal level, the latest twist in the staggering Russia tale must be making life inside the West Wing for Trump and his family more fraught than ever, with the daily pounding of revelations now hitting the President's inner family circle, the place where he has always invested the greatest loyalty. Tuesday's bombshell also handed the White House an ever expanding political problem -- not just because Democrats seized on it to hammer the White House: Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said Trump Jr. may have committed ""treason"" -- though many legal experts would disagree. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer commented that Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer showed ""intent"" and that he must testify before Congress -- signaling a new Democratic attempt to call the administration to account through congressional committees, in addition to the special counsel probe by Mueller. The emails that were released by Trump Jr. on Tuesday may not totally undermine that line, as they are likely to form one piece of evidence in any cases assembled by congressional investigators or the special counsel."	6	7
12 7 2017	https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/trump-campaign-june-9/index.html	Recreating June 9: A very consequential day in the 2016 campaign	11	1	2	" June 9, 2016 -- the day that  Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort  met with a Russian lawyer to get opposition research on Hillary Clinton -- was a 24-hour period that the businessman-turned-presidential candidate likely hated: The spotlight wasn't on him. News of the meeting between Natalia Veselnitskaya, billed in an email as a ""Russian government attorney"" and three of Trump's top campaign aides has rocked the Trump White House and led Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Sen. Tim Kaine, to speculate whether Trump Jr.'s behavior amounts to treason. 4 p.m. : Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, Manafort meet with Russian lawyer at Trump Tower 4:40 p.m. : Trump responds to a Hillary Clinton tweet with a dig about her emails. According to emails released by Trump's eldest son on Tuesday, the meeting was scheduled for 4:00 p.m. The emails, which Donald Trump Jr. released Tuesday ahead of  a story by The New York Times  set to detail the exchanges, show him willing to take information from someone described to him as a ""Russian government attorney"" whose information was ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. At New York's tony Four Seasons Hotel, Trump met for lunch with dozens of top Republican donors to chart his fundraising plan for the general election. After coyly mentioning the news that had already reverberated around the Long Beach City College gym, Clinton's focus now turned to unifying the Democratic Party and squaring up against Trump, who was already the presumed Republican nominee. Clinton, according to campaign records, was home on June 9 as Trump's son met with the Russian lawyer. It's unclear whether Clinton was speaking with reporters when the meeting at Trump Tower took place, but Clinton was reflecting more on her win against Sanders in the interviews than her future contest with Trump."	85	4

Cory Booker  is making the national legalization of marijuana a centerpiece of his  new racial justice bill  -- staking out a position that goes far beyond the decriminalization other Democrats have backed. From a 2020 perspective, Booker's bill is important for two reasons: African-Americans are a hugely important part of the Democratic electorate, starting in South Carolina -- and blacks are disproportionately hit by harsh enforcement marijuana laws. Two things you need to know about Patrick: 1) He's a managing director at Bain Capital -- yes,  that  Bain Capital, the one where  Mitt Romney  worked -- where Patrick oversees investments in companies that address social problems.

5 6 2017	https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/05/politics/tom-perriello-ralph-northam-virginia/index.html	A Virginia Democrat called Trump a 'narcissistic maniac.' And he's not the liberal in the race!	11	1	2	"  (CNN) The eyes of the national media -- and national donors -- are on the June 20 special election runoff in Georgia's 6th district between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel. But a week earlier, Virginia Democrats will choose their party's gubernatorial nominee -- a primary race that may ultimately tell us more about the national playing field and the state of the Democratic party than the contest in Georgia or anywhere else. At root, the race in Virginia mirrors the unfinished fight of the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries between the pragmatic establishment and the ideological left. As the sitting lieutenant governor, he had much of the backing of the party establishment; Terry McAuliffe, the sitting governor, Tim Kaine, the last governor and now a senator, and Mark Herring, the Commonwealth's Attorney General  all endorsed Northam  last year. But as we saw in the Clinton-Sanders fight, the establishment's ability to dictate its wishes to its base is very, very limited. Perriello ran relentlessly to Northam's left, casting himself as the candidate of the Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wing of the party. In fact,  Perriello's closing ad  -- released Monday -- features Warren delivering an extended testimonial to Perriello's commitment ""to make change, not for the richest or the most powerful, but....to make this economy work better for hard-working families."" In a  Washington Post poll  conducted in mid-May, Perriello was at 40 percent to 38 percent for Northam. If you needed more evidence, just check out how the message Northam has settled on in the race. Northam began running  ads in early May  in which he, as a doctor, offers this ""diagnosis"" of President Trump: ""I've been listening carefully to Donald Trump and I think he's a narcissistic maniac."" Short of p osing with a fake Trump head in your hand , Democrats are ready to believe and get behind virtually any negative assessment of his presidency. If Perriello wins next Tuesday, that should be the takeaway for every Democrat running in a primary race between now and next fall. And, if Perriello wins on  that  message, Democrats across the country will take it as a blueprint for how to regain their footholds not just in Congress but in governor's mansions around the U.S.: Blast Trump -- and blast him hard."	61	7

President Donald Trump, speaking in Bedminster, New Jersey, said he condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides."" Vice President Mike Pence echoed Trump's sentiment on Twitter, quoting the President's tweet and adding, ""I stand with @POTUS against hate & violence."" Trump's failure to explicitly mention that white nationalists were behind the protests and violence drew criticism from Republican leaders, including Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the most senior Republican in the Senate.

And the US military's  shooting down of a Syrian government jet on Sunday  has injected new urgency for advocates in Congress who want to pass an authorization for use of military force against ISIS -- which could at the same time limit military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Lawmakers say that the escalating military action in Syria -- including the jet shootdown, commanders' increased authority to take military action and Trump's decision in April to launch missile strikes against government targets -- underscores the need for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority to authorize war. ""With this President quietly delegating authorities to the secretary of defense and commanders of the field, I think it's critical that this committee and the Congress as a whole embrace our oversight duties,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who was Foreign Relations chairman when the committee voted on an ISIS war authorization in 2014. Still, Congress faces major hurdles to passing legislation that could authorize the use of force against ISIS or the Assad regime, as the balance of war-making power has markedly shifted toward the Executive Branch under both the Obama and Trump administrations. A 16-year-old war authorization The Obama and Trump administrations have relied on the war authorization that passed right after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as legal justification for military action against ISIS. ""You can't justify going after ISIS under the 2001 (Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF), let alone going after Syrian aircraft,"" said Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. To many Republicans, however, Trump's decision is a sign he's listening to commanders in the field, and is a response to criticism of the Obama White House that it was micro-managing military action and setting artificial withdrawal dates for Iraq and Afghanistan."	40	5

In her speech, she focused on criminal justice reform,  noting : ""There's a real opportunity to reach parts of America that feel overlooked and don't realize how much they have in common with people who look very different."" But, if they don't -- and neither is a sure thing -- he could well slot into the leading liberal role, given his outspokenness on gun control in the wake of Newtown and, more recently, his vocal opposition to the Trump presidency. Not only did he speak at the CAP conference, but  he also gave a very vague answer to Politico  -- ""I'm not focused on running for president"" -- when asked about 2020.

12 6 2017	https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/12/opinions/perriello-democratic-model-opinion-sellers/index.html	The candidate to watch in Virginia	11	1	2	" But the idea that we can promote one message to appeal to the white working class, inspire people of color to vote and urge the growing progressive wing to mobilize is simply baffling. And while it is critical for Democrats to address the economic anxieties of all Americans, we must speak to people in a way that truly resonates and hits home. To do this effectively, Democrats cannot simply shift to an exclusively economic message, abandoning identity politics and social justice causes. In other words, Democrats must create a multipronged platform that speaks to the financial fears of white voters and the social fears of people of color. And if Democrats need an example of how to effectively speak to all the fears of voters, they need look no further than the gubernatorial Democratic primary taking place in the battleground state of Virginia. There is the false narrative emerging that Perriello, who has scored the endorsements of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, is viewed as representing the progressive wing of the party. In contrast, Northam, a former two-term senator, who has the endorsements of many traditional Virginia Democrats, including Sen. Tim Kaine and Gov. For example, there are many Clinton supporters who appreciate both candidates for their progressive stances, but are still supporting Perriello because they are drawn to his authentic social justice message, one that's rooted in understanding the plight of voters of color coupled with tangible policy goals. Even during  Sanders' recent speech at the People's Summit, he was rightly heavy on economic populism and disappointingly scant of civil rights and social justice. While many continue to pay lip service to the faithful party base, Perriello has created a campaign that moves beyond the rhetoric and is truly responsive to communities of color that are still hurting. He understands the blueprint for crafting a message that speaks to disaffected white voters, while also giving voters of color a full-throated reason to come out and vote for his campaign. However, African-American voters, especially in the South, understand that they do not have the luxury to choose between economic justice and racial justice. Perriello has not only called for a "" Commission on Racial Healing and Transformation ,"" but he's gone even further: ""We have to call out racism structural and overt where we see it, and we have to continue to address the issues of deep racial inequality we have here in Virginia, where the median net worth of an African-American family remains 1/11th that of a median white family in Virginia. Traditional methods take black voters for granted, and the result is depressed turnout. In 2012, the Census Bureau said black voters for the first time voted at a  higher share  than non-Hispanic whites. Contrast that to 2016 black voter turnout, when turnout was down across the board, including swing states like Virginia. And as we move forward, I strongly encourage party leaders to take some notes from Perriello's playbook."	45	4

Gov. Perriello drew headlines at the outset of the campaign for his full-throated assault on Trump, an apparent effort to nationalize the race and coalesce the growing opposition to the incoming administration's controversial agenda. Among the Obama veterans to line up behind Perriello were 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe and former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, who more recently served as a top aide on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Perriello, who backed Obamacare, then defended his decision -- and the law -- when many of his Democratic colleagues backed off, was confronted on the trail for his support of the ""Stupak Amendment,"" a proposed Obamacare tweak that would have denied federal money to insurance plans offering abortion coverage. At a town hall in Richmond a month earlier, Perriello suggested those votes would hamstring Northam in a general election debate with the likely GOP nominee, Ed Gillespie, who served as the Republican National Committee chair during Bush's re-election campaign before eventually working in his White House for 18 months."	53	3

Changing the convention rules will likely not only require substantial support on the Rules Committee, it will require a majority of convention delegates to approve -- many of whom were recruited by and support the Trump campaign. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up  Another effort being organized by Republican strategists including M. Dane Waters and Eric O'Keefe, ""Delegates Unbound,"" plans to spend $2.5 million to $3.5 million on dual goals of educating delegates about their belief that delegates should be free to vote their beliefs under the current rules, and on a separate goal of stopping Trump. CNN delegate analyst and former Rubio campaign aide Will Holley notes the rule governing the convention as of now says the ""secretary of the convention shall faithfully announce and record each delegate's vote in accordance with the delegate's obligation under these rules, state law or state party rule"" -- and he doesn't buy the argument that abstaining gets around that. And a common scenario is delegates deciding to give up their tickets to Cleveland, meaning they would likely be replaced with people favoring Trump regardless, meaning a vote to change the rules would be more difficult. In Ohio, for example, where all of the delegates are bound to support John Kasich -- two have notified the party that they do not intend to go to the convention now that Trump is the nominee, with one calling herself a conscientious objector and another, Ross McGregor (R-Springfield), citing a traveling conflict. ""And we're all voting for John Kasich anyway; we're bound to John Kasich, so we're going to vote for Kasich on the first ballot — and I don't think there's going to be any second ballot, so none of these people will ever actually cast a vote for Donald Trump."""	42	6
