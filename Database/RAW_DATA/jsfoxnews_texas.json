Ted Cruz.", "ADVERTISEMENT", "Beto O'Rourke, a 44-year-old Democrat from the remote West Texas city of El Paso, has advocated for legalizing marijuana and preaches tolerance on the U.S.-Mexico border in defiance of President Donald Trump's \"Build that wall\" mantra.", "On Friday, O'Rourke should formally announce his 2018 Senate candidacy against Cruz, a conservative who finished second to Trump in last year's GOP presidential primary.", "The third-term congressman and fluent Spanish speaker is the kind of rising political star Democrats hope can help begin turning deep red Texas blue, aided by a booming Hispanic population and state politics pushed even farther right by Trump and Cruz. He first made a name for himself playing guitar for Foss, an El Paso punk rock band that included drummer Cedric Bixler-Zavala, who went on to play for the Grammy Award-winning act The Mars Volta.", "But before O'Rourke can challenge Cruz, he'll have to emerge from a Democratic primary field that could include another up-and-comer, fellow Rep. Joaquin Castro from San Antonio.", "\"The Trump factor.

A Democrat hasn't won statewide office in Texas in 23 years, the nation's longest losing streak by a political party.", "Still, O'Rourke insists Cruz is beatable and there are some positive signs for Democrats, who in November swept down-ballot races in Harris County, which includes Houston, and made notable gains in other fast-growing areas. Trump still beat Hillary Clinton in Texas by 9 percentage points -- but that was the first time a Republican didn't carry the state by double digits since 1996.", "Castro hasn't tamped down speculation he too will run for Senate and would be favored over O'Rourke. Both have crisscrossed the state, engaging top donors and party activists. Hinojosa says he's assuming Castro will run with help from his twin brother, Julian, the former San Antonio mayor who was President Barack Obama's Housing and Urban Development Secretary.", "On resume alone, O'Roruke would seem an unlikely choice, but he has been an underdog before.", "O'Rourke was elected to the El Paso City Council at age 32 but remained virtually unknown outside his hometown until the 2012 Democratic primary, when he ousted eight-term Rep. Silvestre Reyes, a former House Intelligence chairman.", "His El Paso district is strongly Democratic, making general elections since then an afterthought. The dynamics will be far different in a Senate race: Even if O'Rourke survives a dogfight primary, beating Cruz would be far tougher.", "\"I think his history indicates if he decides to do this, he will spend all his energy, time and resources on getting elected,\" said Jose Rodriguez, a state senator from El Paso who has hosted past O'Rourke congressional fundraisers. \"There are indicators that people are tired of what's going on with the current administration (and) the kind of campaign that Ted Cruz ran.\"", "O'Rourke has long been a supporter of legalizing pot to slow the drug war that for years turned Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, into one of the world's deadliest places. He authored the 2011 book, \"Dealing Death and Drugs,\" which argued that America's war on drugs had failed.", "O'Rourke was arrested in 1995 for breaking and entering after jumping a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso during what he now says was a prank, but prosecutors declined the case. Three years later, O'Rourke was arrested for drunken driving and received deferred adjudication to avoid conviction, an incident he has called a mistake.", "His father was a former El Paso County judge and a longtime Democrat who switched parties in 1996 to run unsuccessfully for Congress as a Republican. The younger O'Rourke is an outspoken advocate for bipartisanship, saying both parties should work together to foment trade and cultural exchange on the border.", "When a snowstorm canceled flights into Washington this month, O'Rourke and Republican Rep. Will Hurd, from a sprawling Texas district next to his, spent 36 hours driving a rented Chevy Impala from San Antonio to the nation's capital, livestreaming much of the way. The pair became an internet sensation during hours of listening to Johnny Cash, hitting Whataburger and jointly opposing Trump's border wall.", "There was widespread speculation Cruz could face a GOP primary challenge for being slow to endorse Trump last fall -- but much of that has faded since Cruz has become a vocal supporter of Trump after November. Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier declined to comment on O'Rourke's entering the 2018 Senate race.", "Perhaps tellingly, Cruz has sometimes singled out the Castro brothers for past criticism. He hasn't targeted O'Rourke, at least not yet."]},

The time for tax reform is right now. We did not do this since 1986! And tonight, the president dined with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. ", "Here's what's happening.

Now, according to Republican members on the House Ways and Means Committee, the current federal tax code -- look at this, over 70,000 pages! Who could ever comprehend that?", "Now, put that in perspective for you -- back in 1913, when the income tax was introduced, it was only 400 pages long. Now, the Tax Foundation also has an estimate that Americans spent 8.9 billion hours in tax preparation last year!

He wants that 15 percent corporate tax rate. Why? Because that makes American businesses more competitive on the global stage.

This makes perfect sense, and it's simple and it's easy and it's basic and it's fundamental. A low flat tax rate, tax returns that can be filed on a postcard, immediate expensing for businesses, a low corporate tax rate, repatriation, ending the death tax, getting rid of the alternative minimum tax.

It's not like these issues or ideas are new. Just like with ObamaCare. What have you been doing? You've been promising and promising and running and elect us and elect us. The American people -- you've been doing this for years! And you know what? You said you're going to do this. You said you'll cut taxes. You said you'll pass reform. You said you'll repeal and replace. Where is your sense of urgency? Every American I know has a sense of urgency on their job. Where's your accountability?", "Now, the president can't do everything on his own. You need to hold up your end of the bargain. You need to accomplish something for once!", "Here with reaction, Texas senator Ted Cruz. Senator, are my expectations out of whack?", "SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: Sean, you're exactly right. Your expectations are what the American people are rightly demanding. We need to get the job done. We've got a mandate, an overwhelming victory from the voters in November. They've given us a Republican president, Republican heads of every agency and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. We don't have any more excuses. We need to get the job done.", "And the big four that we promised the American people is repeal the train wreck that is \"Obama care.\" We've got to get that done. Major tax cuts, major tax reform -- we got to get that done. Regulatory reform, getting Washington off the backs of small businesses and job creators. And confirming constitutionalists to the U.S. Supreme Court and the federal courts.", "If we do those four, this could be the most productive Congress in decades. And if we don't do any of them, it will be a heartbreaking missed opportunity.", "HANNITY: Listen, I see that your plan and the president's plan are almost identical. I can live with either one and the American people would benefit. You add energy independence to that. ", "CRUZ: Absolutely.", "HANNITY: You're right about justices. You build 400 miles -- 300 miles of the wall. You show you're getting that job done. And Republicans can have the best year they ever dreamed of in 2018!", "CRUZ: Yes.", "HANNITY: But it's not happening. And I -- do you agree that the Republicans, especially in the Senate, have pushed the president into the arms of the Democrats now, and he's got to look for alternates?", "CRUZ: Well, look, I think the president is frustrated. I think the American people are frustrated because we're not getting the job done. On \"Obama care,\" we came one vote short. It was beyond -- it made your head explode. But let me tell you, on \"Obama care,\" we're going to get the job done. I believe failure is not an option. I've told Mitch McConnell, I've told other senators we need to keep at it until we honor that promise, and critically, we lower premiums and give people more choices, more options, put you in charge of your health care.", "On tax reform, we've got to do it. And what the president just said that you aired earlier on the show, simple and fair. Put it on a postcard. Get rid of those 9 billion hours that we waste filling out forms, paying accountants, paying lawyers. Make it simple, fair and focus on jobs.

If we don't get any of it done, we'll have a terrible election in 2018!", "HANNITY: Senator, here's your plan. Now, it's what I've been saying. It's what the president has been saying. It's simple! Give the middle class a tax cut, corporate tax cuts, repatriation, file on a postcard. I agree with you 100 percent. And you add that to energy jobs and you've got millions of Americans now working. And you got money flowing in to Washington. You guys will have more money than you ever dreamed of. And Newt Gingrich told me he thinks it's about a 50 percent shot we get that done. Those aren't great odds to me.", "CRUZ: Well, and let me emphasize a couple of points from the tax speech I gave today. Number one, the president said today he wants a big, big tax cut. There's some Republicans in Congress that are talking about making tax reform revenue-neutral. Revenue-neutral means they're not cutting taxes. They're just moving money around from one bucket to another. We don't need revenue-neutral. We need a big tax cut on you, on families who are struggling, on small businesses. We need a Reaganesque tax cut that unleashes incredible growth.", "And I laid out today how we do it. We do that under the budget rules by having a 30-year budget window, which means we can have a big tax cut that isn't revenue-neutral that lasts for 30 years and unleashes booming growth.", "Let me make a second point, which is something I called for today, which is total expensing, immediate expensing of capital expenditures. What that does, if you're a farmer, it lets you buy a new tractor. If you're a steel worker, it lets the company invest in a new steel factory. If you're a truck driver, it lets you buy a new truck.", "We care about jobs here in America, Main Street jobs, manufacturing jobs, union jobs, blue-collar jobs. Immediate expensing unleashes incredible growth. I think that's a very important part of tax cuts and tax reforms that we're pushing forward.", "HANNITY: Senator, you mentioned that you still think the window's open on health care. One of the proposals -- and as a conservative, I always kind of like the idea of sending stuff back to the states...", "CRUZ: Absolutely.", "HANNITY: Lindsey Graham has that proposal. I talked to Dave Brat and I talked to Mark Meadows. They support it, but they said the devil is in the details. ", "CRUZ: Sure.", "HANNITY: Something that could work, is that maybe the alternate, maybe you get it done by the 30th using reconciliation or considering reconciliation?", "CRUZ: I think Lindsey Graham's proposal could easily be part of the solution. I am a big, big believer in federalism, sending things to the states, empowering the states. You know, that's something -- if Lindsey's proposal brings a few moderates on board, great. And let different states have different approaches. Let a John Kasich in Ohio have one approach, and let a conservative like Greg Abbott in Texas have a different approach. That's why we've got 50 states.", "HANNITY: Absolutely.", "CRUZ: And...", "HANNITY: That's why I'll move to Texas.", "CRUZ: ... and I think we're close on ObamaCare. You know, I think we're -- ", "HANNITY: I'm -- Senator, I want to say one last thing. I don't -- I'm really -- like, I can't tell you the type of feedback I'm getting from my audience in radio and TV. They are livid! They're apoplectic. And I will say this. You -- on health care, you keep saying on the economy, Keep your promises. The Freedom Caucus is working day and night with you and together to keep their promises. If these guys don't wake up, you're the only few people I trust in Washington now. It's really despicable.", "CRUZ: Well, Sean, the role I'm trying to play is do everything I can to help and encourage the president to go in a positive direction, not a negative direction, and to bring Republicans together, talking to conservatives and moderates and leadership and the president and the administration saying, Everyone, look, if we do our job, just keep our word, the economy booms...", "HANNITY: That's it.", "CRUZ: ... we see more jobs.

And that is the poor, I would say reckless judgment of James Comey. And I don't know whether he deserved to the fired because of the Russian investigation. That sounds like a poor decision by the president which led to the Mueller appointment, but I do think he should have been disciplined because of his recklessness and the way he handled Hillary's email investigation, and President Trump and his deputy attorney general agree with that statement.

If you look at the NFL players, you look at the PGA, the LPGA even, very frequent voters, very conservative people, and those are your ESPN viewers. And so if they were going to do anything with this particular commentator, they may want to think of replacing her just because she is bashing their own audience.

He left copies of his identification sitting all around. Luke was very detailed in this story on how this happened. ", "And just like Gregg said, Sean, these are huge national security implications. Imran Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, they moved data apparently, if this story is true, from protected servers of members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, to an offsite server that was connected to the House Democratic Caucus. And that could have been established right there. They could have put it within the server that's connected to the House Democratic Caucus, created a backdoor where they could infiltrate that system wherever they wanted.

Ted Cruz will put it on the front burner.", "This afternoon, we were out on the campaign trail with Texas governor, former governor Rick Perry and Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Myer. Talking about our vets --", " Katrina, now --", ": Donald Trump is pro-life and has been for a very long time. We too are on the ground in South Carolina listening to the voters who think that a lot of these things that the Cruz campaign are too doing have very sleazy from Iowa all the way to South Carolina with these horrible push polls.", "I will say this with regard to immigration. Donald Trump is the most solid on immigration as we have seen and the only reason we are having this discussion is because of Donald Trump. On Senator Cruz's own YouTube page, he is praising bringing Syrian refugees to this country because it's the right thing to do for America. He flip-flopped on that after Mr. Trump came out against it. He supported increasing HB1 visas and green cards.", " Right. We can't go through the complete platforms of both candidates. What I would like to talk about a little bit and we don't have a ton of time. I'm going to start with you Katrina, in the aftermath of the last debate where Donald Trump had mentioned some things about George W. Bush yet afterwards the poll numbers haven't seem to have budged. Is he concerned -- are you hearing on the ground that that's going to affect anything going forward going into Saturday's primary?", " No. Not at all, Eric. The people on the ground in South Carolina and all over the country are tired of the transnational corporations backed people like Senator Ted Cruz who promotes Obama trade. They are tired of it. They want their jobs back. They want to make things in this country again. They want to secure the borders. They want to stop immigration. They want to deport criminal aliens.", "The people on the ground get it. They are very used to politics and politic politicians alike and that's why we see the poll numbers staying the same.", ": And what do you say Alice. Is Ted Cruz concerned that the poll numbers in the aftermath of the -- what a lot of people thought this was the one thing that's going to give Donald Trump his numbers to come down after all the other things. This was going to be the one because George W. Bush seems to be beloved, but it hasn't seemed to budge. Is Ted Cruz concerned that maybe he shouldn't have picked this fight?", "Well, here's the thing. Ted Cruz has done nothing more than point out Donald Trump's own record and his own words. And for -- it's sad that Katrina has to defend someone who basically says anyone that calls out his record is lying. That's a pretty weak defense. And just by saying someone is a liar does not address the issue. So, you know, it's unfortunate.", " Here is where the rubber meets the road. You look at the last poll, the poll we just sited Ted Cruz was solidly in second prior to that poll. Now he is tied for second. His numbers have slid a bit. Is this a concern in the Cruz camp?", " We are encouraged by the crowds we've seen here on the ground in South Carolina. We are making tens of thousands of phone calls every day and knocking on doors and having tremendous surrogates out here on the trail with us. And keep in mind, the polls have Donald Trump in first in Iowa and we had a resounding victory in Iowa.", "We are looking forward to Saturday.", "We're going to have to leave it right there, ladies. Thank you very much. Hot debate."]},
