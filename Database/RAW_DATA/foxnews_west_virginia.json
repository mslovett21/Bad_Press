Carter may benefit in part from the family name -- and Georgia's growing minority population which could eventually change the state's solid Republican status -- but Republicans are trying to defeat the candidate by reconnecting him to the family.\u00a0", "\"Jason has a lot to overcome in regards to his family name in a traditionally red state,\" Republican strategist Joe Desilets told FoxNews.com.\u00a0", "For now, Carter must convince an electorate that has installed a Republican governor, a GOP-led General Assembly and twice as many Republicans as Democrats on Capitol Hill.\u00a0", "Within days of announcing his campaign in early November, Carter was already distancing himself from a recent call by his grandfather, also a former Georgia governor, to end the state's death-penalty sentences.\u00a0", "\"I love my grandfather,\" the 38-year-old Carter told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"But we disagree on this issue. I believe in the death penalty for heinous crimes, and that won't change when I'm governor.\"\u00a0", "Carter, a moderate state senator, is the first Democratic candidate to enter the gubernatorial race, potentially clearing the primary field for himself to challenge incumbent Republican Gov. Nathan Deal in the November 2014 general election.\u00a0", "An internal poll by Alabama-based firm Anzalone Liszt Grove Research conducted in mid-October showed Carter might have an opening. It showed 49 percent of respondents preferring a new governor, compared with 36 percent wanting to re-elect Deal.\u00a0", "And Carter trailed Deal by just single digits in a head-to-head race, according to the poll results, released Nov. 12 and obtained by FoxNews.com.\u00a0", "While the elder Carter's popularity has grown since leaving the White House, as is often the case with ex-presidents, Republicans and Democrats have not forgotten that his controversial liberal policies opened the door for Ronald Reagan to defeat him in 1980.\u00a0", "\"If Jason Carter's campaign looks to place an emphasis on his grandfather being a former president ... then they can't wrap themselves in the good and distance themselves from the bad,\" Deal campaign manager Tom Willis told Politico. \"We are sure everyone in the Carter family is anxious to see what a 2014 referendum on President Carter's administration will look like. We look forward to that referendum as well.\"\u00a0", "Desilets argues President Carter's personal involvement in the grandson's previous campaigns \"also limits the distance that Jason is legitimately able to put between himself and his grandfather.\"\u00a0", "He said: \"If Governor Deal and the [Republican Governors Association] can tie Jason to his grandfather, then he has even more of an uphill battle than he already has against a popular incumbent governor.\"\u00a0", "Carter, who has already staked out a centrist position that focuses on education and the economy, will also have to overcome a substantial fundraising disadvantage against Deal whose campaign for a second term had $1.1 million this summer, according to the most recent fundraising records.\u00a0", "Carter had $27,800 in his General Assembly filings, over the same period.\u00a0", "Desilets thinks the disparity will be compounded by the likelihood that big money from state and national Democratic donors will go first to the U.S. Senate race in which they think Michelle Nunn, the daughter of former Democratic Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, has a legitimate shot at winning GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss' open seat."]},

The claim got a lot of attention because Quayle was running for vice president of the United States at the time.", "Now, 22 years later, Kimberlin has taken that lesson and made unfounded accusations a profession of sorts. Using two popular leftist blogs, the 56-year-old from Bethesda, Md., has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from the public and left-leaning foundations by promising to put conservatives he disagrees with in jail, often with offers of large rewards. So far -- without success -- he has called for the arrest of Karl Rove, Andrew Breitbart, Chamber of Commerce head Tom Donohue, Massey Energy Chairman Don Blankenship and other high-profile public figures.", "A review of tax filings for Kimberlin's blogs, \"Velvet Revolution\" and \"Justice Through Music,\" raises troubling questions about whether his \"nonprofit\" operations are dedicated to public activism -- or are just a new facade for a longtime con artist.", "Though neither website publicly reveals Kimberlin\u2019s role, tax and corporate documents show that he is one of four directors who incorporated the Velvet Revolution, and that he is the registered agent for the tax-exempt, non-stock company, which is registered at his mother\u2019s house in Bethesda. In 2008, the last year for which tax records are available, Velvet Revolution took in $83,000 in gifts and contributions.", "Kimberlin is also one of two incorporators of Justice Through Music, as well as a $19,500-a-year employee of the non-profit, whose purpose is to \u201cshed light on some of the injustices of the world through music\u201d and which took in more than $550,000 in contributions in 2008.", "What those who view the blogs -- and those who donate to them -- aren\u2019t told is who Kimberlin is and where he's been. And that is a twisted story, indeed.", "Kimberlin grew up in a suburb of Indianapolis where, just out of high school, he ran a large-scale marijuana operation as well as a health food store and a vegetarian restaurant. According to accounts at the time and public records, he became involved with an underage girl whose grandmother objected to the relationship and tried to take her away. When the grandmother was found shot to death in her garage, police began focusing on Kimberlin, who -- possibly to divert attention -- began an eight-day bombing campaign in Speedway, Ind.", "That bombing spree did more than cause widespread terror in Speedway; it severely injured a man who had to have his leg amputated and who, unable to cope with the pain, later committed suicide. His widow sued Kimberlin\u00a0and was awarded a $1.6 million civil judgment.", "In the same period as the bombing spree, in 1978, Kimberlin was arrested in Texas while preparing to receive a plane carrying 5 tons of marijuana at a makeshift air strip he and his compatriots had scratched out of the desert. The operation was so big, it supplied marijuana to at least four states, according to authorities and local news reports at the time. To help with the operation, Kimberlin would often assume the false identity of an official from the Department of Defense.", "That operation fell apart when a local printer, whom Kimberlin had asked to create a false federal ID card, reported him to authorities, and he was charged with impersonating a federal official.", "After separate trials for the bombings, the drug offenses and the impersonation charges -- he was suspected but never charged with the grandmother's murder -- Kimberlin was sentenced to more than 50 years in federal prison.", "And it was there that he learned the power of unsubstantiated accusation. Just before the 1988 election Kimberlin caused a sensation when he told reporters he had been Quayle\u2019s marijuana supplier in college. As word of the accusation spread, a prison press conference was called and then canceled as reporters waited outside.", "But that action by prison officials gave Kimberlin's story credence, and he declared himself a political prisoner -- a claim that attracted Mark Singer, a writer from The New Yorker magazine, who thought it would make for a great story. After Singer ran a long sympathetic piece in 1992, he got a book contract to write about the fate of an American political prisoner. The two split a large cash advance from the publisher and began to work together.", "In the process, Singer discovered that Kimberlin was far from a hero. In fact, he realized, the man who had gotten the attention of the nation was a liar and a con man, and he ended up writing a story of how he had been taken in by a \u201cnarcissist.\u201d Kimberlin, for his part, who had been released on parole after 14 years in prison, was sent back to jail for a parole violation. The charge was hiding the money from his advance to prevent the widow of the woman whose husband he maimed from collecting on the bombing victim widow's civil judgment.", "And it is that civil judgment that may explain Kimberlin's blog sites and much of his existence since prison. Because of the judgment, which with interest is now more than $3 million, anything Kimberlin has in his own name is subject to seizure. He lives in his mother\u2019s home in Bethesda and operates the websites out of there. It's hardly a happy place, though; Kimberlin's mother has sued him and won a $150,000 judgment against him, and he and his wife have traded domestic abuse charges, according to local records. It even may explain the causes of the moment on which the websites focus their energy, likely to generate cash.", "In the past three years, Velvet Revolution and Justice Through Music have raised more than $1.5 million. Yet Velvet Revolution hardly seems like a dynamic organization; it has had only 10 new posts in the past six months. And Justice Through Music, despite a voter registration effort that simply includes an online registration form, seems to be little more than a music website that plows through money each year.", "Perhaps the most perplexing question on the sites' tax returns concerns the growing rent payments from the non-profit, which jumped from just below $10,000 in 2006 to more than $80,000 two years later. Given Kimberlin\u2019s history, what really happened to the money is a fair question. And given his silence -- calls and messages to Kimberlin, both through the blog and to his home address, were not returned -- it is a pressing one.\u00a0"]},

They said Massey's safety programs were just a facade \u2014 never backed by more money to hire additional miners or take more time on safety tasks.", "Blankenship was acquitted of felonies that could have stretched his sentence to 30 years.", "On Wednesday, lead defense attorney William Taylor said the former U.S. attorney was \"using this case as part of the reason to vote for him.\" Booth Goodwin left the office shortly after Blankenship's conviction to run for governor.", "\"Well, when all else fails, attack the prosecutor,\" Goodwin said after the sentencing.", "In 2011, Alpha Natural Resources, which bought Massey after the explosion, agreed to pay $210 million to compensate grieving families, bankroll cutting-edge safety improvements and pay for years of violations by Massey Energy.
