It could make for more extreme weather across the Northern Hemisphere, especially Europe, and could increase sea level rise along the U.S. East Coast, they said.", "The slowdown also raises the prospect of a complete circulation shutdown, which would be a dangerous \"tipping point,\" according to a study in Wednesday's journal Nature .", "Such a shutdown was the premise of the scientifically inaccurate 2004 disaster movie \"The Day After Tomorrow.\" Study authors said a collapse is at least decades away but would be a catastrophe.", "\"We know somewhere out there is a tipping point where this current system is likely to break down,\" said study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. \"We still don't know how far away or close to this tipping point we might be. ... This is uncharted territory.\"", "Some other scientists are skeptical, citing a scarcity of data.", "The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, called AMOC, is a key conveyor belt for ocean water and air, creating weather. Warm salty water moves north from the tropics along the Gulf Stream off the U.S. East Coast to the North Atlantic, where it cools, sinks and heads south. The faster it moves, the more water is turned over from warm surface to cool depths.", "\"This overturning circulation redistributes heat on our planet,\" said study lead author Levke Caesar, a physicist at the Potsdam Institute. \"It brings heat from the tropics to the high latitudes.\"", "The Caesar study and another one published in the same issue of Nature by a different team indicate that the Atlantic's circulation is the weakest it's been in about 1,500 years. And the slowdown is intensifying.", "Since the middle of the 20th century, the speed at which the ocean moves water in the AMOC has dropped 15 percent, the study found, using cold subpolar water temperatures as an indirect measurement. And it has plummeted in recent years, the study concluded.", "The Gulf Stream, the warm water current where hurricanes can power up, historically veers away from the United States around the Carolinas or Virginia. The Gulf Stream now hugs closer to coast around New York, and there's a significantly warmer bulge around Maine related to the circulation slowdown, Rahmstorf and Caesar said. The northern U.S. Atlantic coastal waters have warmed faster than most parts of the ocean in recent decades, researchers said.", "Scientists blame global warming in a couple of ways.", "Warmer water lessens the amount of cooling and makes it harder for the water to sink and turn over. Ice sheets and glaciers in Greenland are melting and the fresh water is pouring into the area where the water turns over, making it less salty, less dense and therefore less likely to sink. There's also more rain and snow in northern areas and more evaporation in southern areas, altering the flow, Rahmstorf said.", "\"It's a slow change at the moment, but we're changing it,\" Caesar said. \"One danger is in the unknown of what will happen. We should expect changes.\"", "Rahmstorf and Caesar looked at an established cold patch \u2014 about 2 million square miles (5.2 million square kilometers), or the size of India and Mexico combined \u2014 as the indirect measurements for the speed of the AMOC, calling it a fingerprint of the ocean circulation.", "It's clear that the circulation is weakening, said Colorado State hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach, who wasn't part of the studies. Decades ago, that would have meant weaker Atlantic hurricane activity, but that hasn't been happening and it could mean there is a difference in weakening in winter and summer, he said.", "Andreas Schmittner at Oregon State University, who also wasn't part of the studies, said the Potsdam group's analysis makes sense, adding that as the world emits more greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels, we can expect it to slow further.", "But MIT's Carl Wunsch said that the paper's \"assertions of weakening are conceivable, but unsupported by any data.\"", "And Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said his recent work faults regular cycles in the atmosphere more than the ocean. He said the Potsdam study doesn't explain year to year variability, while atmospheric cycles do.", "Rahmstorf said his study averages data over a decade at a time to render year-to-year changes less meaningful. The work shows that it is ocean circulation that drives the changes in atmosphere, not the other way around, he said.", "___", "Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

The 55 pictures of black leaders and everyday people in this show, installed in a hallway and small gallery, are some that he shot that day.

(You could also throw Dada and Surrealist artists like John Heartfield, Hannah Hoch, Kurt Schwitters and Max Ernst on the pile of significant precursors.) And yet, when you step back from the flurry of references and citations, there is a sustaining sureness and a charm in it that stay with you. Mr. Seydel had a wonderful sense of color and composition and a great sense of curiosity, as well as the belief that art is a place of refuge where you can retreat from the present \u2014 and possibly even remake the past.

Its purpose was to gain social justice for New York\u2019s working-class Latino population, then largely Puerto Rican and treated with contempt by the city.

Dean gathered these women together, she says in her preface, \u201cunder the sign of a compliment that every one of them received in their lives: They were called sharp.\u201d", "It is, of course, a compliment with an edge. Call a man \u201csharp\u201d and he\u2019s stylish, incisive, smart. Apply it to a woman, Dean writes, and there\u2019s a \u201csense of terror underlying it. Sharpness, after all, cuts.\u201d A virtue of her book is that it shows how each woman, by wielding a pen as if it were a scalpel or a scimitar, confounded the gender norm of niceness and placed her analytical prowess front and center. Among 20th-century intellectuals, \u201cmen might have outnumbered women, demographically,\u201d Dean writes, but \u201cin the arguably more crucial matter of producing work worth remembering, the work that defined the terms of their scene, the women were right up to par \u2014 and often beyond it.\u201d I agree with her.", "Dean has arranged her book as a series of biographical portraits, one woman to a chapter, in chronological order. She also includes shorter segue chapters \u2014 entr\u2019actes \u2014 in which two or three of the women intersect. (These include cameo appearances by the African-American novelist Zora Neale Hurston and the combative playwright Lillian Hellman.) As with all such lineups, Dean\u2019s raises questions about who is there and who isn\u2019t. Would she have been better off beginning with Virginia Woolf rather than Dorothy Parker? Woolf was a consummate artist and pioneering feminist, arguably greater than any of Dean\u2019s 10, while Parker, who could be harder on herself than she was on her victims \u2014 self-regarding writers (whom she parodied), forgettable plays, bad books \u2014 wouldn\u2019t dream of calling her writing \u201cart.\u201d", "By stressing \u201copinion\u201d in the book\u2019s subtitle, however, Dean has framed sharpness as a barbed pulpit in which the public intellectual or critic-as-virtuoso resides. Where the mysterious interiority of Woolf\u2019s novels was never going to grab the masses, Parker\u2019s brittle, witty verse (\u201cIf I\u2019m in bed each night by 10, I may get back my looks again\u201d) had real cultural currency in the late 1920s, with its partied-out flappers and collapsing economy. I do wonder, though, why Camille Paglia, the queen Hippolyte of 1990s cultural criticism, isn\u2019t here.", "Well, it\u2019s Dean\u2019s party and she\u2019s invited the sharps she most admires, even if they don\u2019t always admire one another. Positioning herself not as a scholar breaking new ground (many of these women have been well covered in biographies, memoirs and academic studies) but as a missionary championing her subjects\u2019 \u201coppositional spirit,\u201d Dean artfully shepherds the reader through the professional and personal ups and downs of each life, keeping an eye on the affinities \u2014 a taste for battle, an ethic of intellectual honesty \u2014 that made some of them allies (McCarthy and Arendt, Arendt and Adler) and drove others apart (McCarthy and Sontag, Adler and Kael).", "A leitmotif \u2014 at least until Didion, Ephron and Malcolm come along \u2014 is that of being \u201cthe only woman at the table.\u201d Parker embodied this as a member of the Algonquin Round Table, a charmed lunch club in which writers jousted with quips and witticisms. She wasn\u2019t the only woman at this table, but she was the one who memorably bested the men \u2014 her pun on \u201chorticulture\u201d is by far the most quoted piece of Algonquin wordplay. Indeed, two themes run through this book: the hard-won autonomy of the one girl in the boys\u2019 club and her ambivalence toward the feminist movement. Though McCarthy once characterized her heroine in a short story \u2014 a clear alter ego \u2014 as \u201ca princess among the trolls,\u201d and Sontag complained about being the only woman on countless panels, both accepted elevated status as their due and neither felt obliged to lower the ladder for other women. (A story went around that McCarthy baited the younger Sontag, who was suddenly turning heads, by saying, \u201cI hear you\u2019re the new me.\u201d) The political philosopher Arendt \u201cwas steadfastly against feminism until her dying day,\u201d Dean writes. She didn\u2019t think it was a serious use of brainpower. And Didion called some of the movement\u2019s methods \u201cStalinist.\u201d", "Dean teases out the tangled intramural politics, which in many cases trace back to a shared stance against groupthink \u2014 including the groupthink of some schools of feminism. \u201cI ran into quite a lot of people who wanted to cut these women out of history,\u201d Dean writes, \u201cprecisely because they took advantage of their talents, and did so without turning those talents to the explicit support of feminism. It is viewed as an unforgivable lapse.\u201d This is shocking, and it would have been interesting to know if the unforgiving are activists, academics or what.", "For readers unfamiliar with the work of these women, \u201cSharp\u201d should be eye-opening. Dean traverses the intellectual landscape of the 20th century at an easy gallop \u2014 the boozy cocktail parties; the plotting of editors in their offices; the literary and political trench wars, aggressive essays thrown across the breach like grenades. She is frank, giving us the skinny. She admits that much of Parker\u2019s verse doesn\u2019t hold up (\u201cIt seems clich\u00e9d, overwrought\u201d), and owns that Kael, the brilliant film critic of The New Yorker, was less than authoritative on subjects requiring sustained research. (In her book on \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d Kael lined up opinions that supported her thesis yet never interviewed Orson Welles, the film\u2019s director, who was very much alive.) Writing about Adler, the critic and novelist, Dean shows how a relentless need to attack can shade into self-sabotage: It\u2019s one thing to go ferociously at your subjects, backed by a nurturing editor, and quite another to launch an Electra-like offensive against that editor\u2019s replacement.", "For those who have lived with these writers for years, Dean can come up short. When she writes that Adler, in her famous New York Review of Books hatchet job on Kael\u2019s criticism, \u201cmade a decent case,\u201d it\u2019s not enough. Adler was lawyerly, certainly, running down Kael\u2019s every repeated trope and overused word, but her attack was as humorless as Kael\u2019s reviews are pleasurable. You can be so right that you\u2019re wrong, and I wondered what Dean really thinks.", "And what of Ephron, the comic writer and filmmaker whose motto, tattooed on her psyche by her alcoholic mother, was \u201ceverything is copy\u201d \u2014 a phrase that could have been coined by Parker, for whom nothing was sacred and with whom Ephron identified early on. Sure, she wrote \u201cHeartburn,\u201d which shocked the mediacracy by broadcasting raw details from her failed marriage to Carl Bernstein. But what was oppositional about Ephron\u2019s work in Hollywood? Her rom-coms \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d and \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d are formulaic films that pander, with none of the vicious wit her friends enjoyed. (It\u2019s been said that at parties one didn\u2019t want to be the first to leave a conversation that included Ephron, lest she entertain those who remained with a zinger about you.) Did Ephron sell out? Or did she find another way to be the only woman at the table, this time in Tinseltown, where she got to be as trite as the men? Dean doesn\u2019t say.", "Then there\u2019s Malcolm, who at The New Yorker has made a specialty of reportage that stubbornly hovers in the zone where truth, story, presumption and the law merge into mist. She herself, like the Cheshire Cat, appears and disappears, which brings yet another dimension to writing on subjects such as psychoanalysis, crime, and ethics in journalism and biography. Over a long career, an oppositional sensibility can become a default strategy that subtly or not so subtly distorts the picture, and Malcolm\u2019s ineffable calculation sometimes leaves one queasy about her motives. \u201cThe experience of reading a Malcolm text,\u201d Dean writes, \u201cis always to linger in that sense of uncertainty, both about the nominal subject \u2026 and about exactly what new kind of sly trick the narrator might be pulling on us.\u201d Is this the art of opinion? Or something else?", "One is also curious to know where Dean stands on Arendt\u2019s \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem,\u201d a 1963 meditation on war crimes that was incendiary because of its problematic phrase \u201cthe banality of evil,\u201d and a tone so cold that Arendt\u2019s friend the Jewish historian Gershom Scholem thought it flippant (some used the word cruel). Dean lays out this controversy, and many others, with a deft hand, but sometimes skips ahead just when we want her to deliver her own view.", "I was struck, as well, by the number of sloppy sentences. Dean knows that clarity doesn\u2019t exist without precision; Ephron\u2019s meandering style, for instance, is so controlled it\u2019s practically pointillist. And yet Dean\u2019s own writing, direct and lively, can get too loosely conversational \u2014 too wordy and imprecise. Her chatty approach to these formidable women makes them seem accessible, and that\u2019s a good thing. But a blue pencil is as strong as a sword, and more cut and thrust would have made this book sharper."]},

Of specific interest were the revelations that sensitive data of as many as 87 million Facebook users were harvested without explicit permission by a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, which was connected to the Trump campaign.", "Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, appeared confident and answered questions directly, and his performance helped bolster Facebook\u2019s stock, which ended the day up 4.5 percent. It was the first of two marathon hearings; the second will be before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.", "He was forced to admit mistakes and take responsibility for his company\u2019s actions \u2014 as have the many tobacco, pharmaceutical and bank executives who have been summoned to Washington.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty much impossible, I believe, to start a company in your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we\u2019re at now without making some mistakes,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.", "Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, zeroed in on the central issue of the hearing, asking Mr. Zuckerberg whether he would be comfortable sharing aloud the name of the hotel where he stayed on Monday night, or whether he would be comfortable sharing the names of the people he has messaged this week.", "\u201cNo. I would probably not choose to do that publicly here,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.", "\u201cI think that may be what this is all about,\u201d Mr. Durbin said. \u201cYour right to privacy.

Although Washington has long served as a check on the power of Wall Street and other profitable industries, lawmakers have tended to act as cheerleaders for technology companies rather than watchdogs. Light regulation enabled a culture of freewheeling innovation, and the beloved products that Silicon Valley companies created made them politically convenient allies.", "Today, five of the eight largest companies in the world are West Coast technology companies. Only a single East Coast institution, JPMorgan Chase, cracks the top 10. And lawmakers on both sides of the aisle suggested that Facebook and other companies may not be able to police themselves.", "\u201cHave you gotten too big?\u201d Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, asked Mr. Zuckerberg, before suggesting that Facebook might need to be reined in to protect it from itself.", "Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook had become a monopoly, asking why Congress \u201cshould let you self-regulate?\u201d", "Mr. Zuckerberg said he welcomed some form of regulation, as long as it was the \u201cright regulation.\u201d He also expressed support for the Honest Ads Act, a bill in Congress that would require more disclosures from online political advertisers.", "His answers did not mollify lawmakers, including Mr. Graham, who said in a statement after the hearing that \u201ccontinued self-regulation is not the right answer when it comes to dealing with the abuses we have seen on Facebook.\u201d", "Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview that he was \u201cunsatisfied\u201d and that it was clear Facebook could not and would not fully regulate itself and that Congress needed to provide a solution.", "\u201cThe old saying: There ought to be a law,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be a law.

Mr. Zuckerberg offered humor about the company\u2019s onetime mantra: \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d (It has since been edited to \u201cmove fast with stable infrastructure.\u201d) He insisted on continuing questions when offered a break, eliciting smiles and laughter from staff sitting behind him. However, when Mr. Zuckerberg did take a break, he left behind his notes, which were quickly photographed and contained talking points for various topics including \u201cDefend Facebook,\u201d \u201cDisturbing Content\u201d and \u201cElection integrity (Russia).\u201d", "His performance won accolades on Wall Street. \u201cThis is a different Mark Zuckerberg than the Street was fearing,\u201d said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s a defining 48 hours that will determine the future of Facebook, and so far he has passed with flying colors, and the Street is relieved.\u201d", "But Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that his idealistic view of humanity, and those of his fellow executives, had exposed Facebook\u2019s roughly 2.2 billion users to danger.

But this may be changing.\u201d", "Mr. Zuckerberg was careful when pressed on how he defined the company, wary of opening it up to new legal liability.

Ms. Harris pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook executives made a decision not to inform users about the Cambridge Analytica data leak when they learned in 2015 that data was sold by a researcher to the political consulting firm. The question was crucial to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s investigation of Facebook\u2019s violation of a 2011 agreement to protect users\u2019 privacy. If the company withheld information, which violates its agreement, the company could face record fines.", "Mr. Zuckerberg did not admit that the company explicitly decided to withhold that information from consumers, but he said the company had made a mistake in not informing users.", "There were glimmers of a partisan divide during the hearing. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, asked about Facebook\u2019s handling of conservative media, including content related to Glenn Beck and a Fox News personality; Democrats questioned Mr. Zuckerberg on how quickly Facebook responded to Russian meddling in the election.", "But the dominant theme of the day was uncertainty about how to deal with Facebook, a complex, multifaceted giant that even technologists have struggled to define. Lawmakers \u2014 many of whom grew up in an era without social media \u2014 labored at times to understand the fine-grain nuances of Facebook\u2019s business model, such as the difference between selling user data to advertisers and allowing advertisers to target ads to an aggregated slice of Facebook users. At one point, Mr. Zuckerberg was forced to shoot down a conspiracy theory floated by Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, that Facebook listens to users through their microphones in order to serve them ads.", "Mr. Zuckerberg, who spent weeks being coached for the hearing by a team of outside experts, remained cool and collected while fielding question after question.", "But the lawmakers\u2019 technical sophistication was mostly irrelevant \u2014 by the end of the session, the warning had been sent: In order to avoid a much harsher regulatory glare that could include major punitive measures, Facebook needs to stop apologizing, get its act together, and show that it is capable of changing.", "\u201cThis episode has clearly hurt us,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe have to do a lot of work about building trust back.\u201d"]},
