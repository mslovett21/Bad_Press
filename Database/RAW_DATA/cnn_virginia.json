Barnes is a member of the CNN Decision Desk and co-author of the forthcoming 2018 Almanac of American Politics.", " (CNN)", "The dynamics of the 2016 presidential race continue to shape the nation's political terrain, and the latest evidence of that fact is this week's primary results for governor in Virginia. In both the Democratic and Republican races, an urban-rural divide defined the outcome of those contests.", "While these races have a tendency to hinge on local issues, Virginia is a key battleground during presidential and midterm election years. It's the first such state primary in a battleground since 2016, when President Donald Trump lost Virginia and Hillary Clinton carried the state's major metropolitan areas and their suburbs, particularly those outside of Washington, DC and Richmond.", "The Republicans", "Ed Gillespie, the former lobbyist and Republican National Committee chairman, parlayed his establishment connections and a strong showing in an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 2014 into a narrow 44%-43% GOP primary victory over Prince William County Board of Supervisors chairman Corey Stewart. Veteran GOP state Senator Frank Wagner of Virginia Beach finished a distant third with 14%, based on complete but unofficial returns. Gillespie owes his 4,300-vote statewide margin of victory to his strength in the close-in suburbs of Washington, DC, and Richmond, the state capital. ", "In Fairfax County, the largest vote-producer in the primary just outside of Washington, Gillespie defeated Stewart, 48%-39%. Along with his two-to-one advantage over Stewart in nearby Arlington and Alexandria, Gillespie garnered roughly 7,700 votes more than Stewart in these areas.", "Stewart, who aligned himself closely with the views of Trump, ran well on his home turf, the more working-class Washington exurbs of Prince William, defeating Gillespie 60%-32%. Gillespie narrowly prevailed in the more upscale and better-educated exurbs of Loudoun County, 45%-43%. But in the rest of the exurbs beyond the Washington Beltway, Stewart won a plurality of the votes.", "Gillespie captured nearly 60% of the Republican primary votes cast in Richmond and its suburbs of Henrico County. He also narrowly carried the Hampton Roads region, Virginia's other main urban center, which includes Chesapeake, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach, winning just over a third of the votes cast there. Had Wagner not been on the ballot, Gillespie likely would have increased his margins in this area as well. Outside of Lynchburg and the Roanoke metro area, Stewart won wide swaths of the central and western Virginia rural communities, and nearly engineered an upset that few observers gave him much of a chance to pull off.", "The Democrats", "Virginia's \"urban crescent,\" also played a critical role in the Democratic primary, where Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam handily defeated former Rep. Tom Perriello, 56%-44%. Northam, who had wide backing from the state's Democratic Party establishment, trounced Perriello in Virginia's Hampton Roads region. He won roughly seven-out-of-10 votes in this area that is next door to the state Senate district he once held. Northam also swept Richmond as well as its suburbs and exurbs. ", "Perriello carried the 5th Congressional District in central Virginia, which he represented for one term ending in 2011, except for the portions that stretched into the Washington, DC, exurbs of Fauquier and Rappahannock Counties. He also won most of the rural counties in the Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenandoah Valley on the western rim of the state save for half a dozen counties in its southwestern corner, where coal production peaked 20 years ago. Perriello's staunch opposition to a proposed natural gas pipeline just north of the coal region may have hurt him among voters whose communities and culture are tied to fossil fuels.", "But Perriello, who had moved to Arlington in Northern Virginia after his defeat in the 2010 midterm elections, was unable to gain much traction in the Washington suburbs and exurbs, where a strong performance is essential for Democratic candidates. Perriello fought Northam to almost a draw in both Loudoun and Prince William Counties, but in wealthy and increasingly diverse Fairfax County, where almost one-out-of-six of the Democratic primary votes were cast; Northam defeated Perriello 60%-40%. Likewise, he beat Perriello by three-to-two margins in the Democratic bastions of Alexandria and Arlington.", "While Perriello's television advertising featured footage of President Barack Obama touting him in the 2010 midterm elections, Northam ran very strong in urban areas where African-American voters account for a large proportion of the electorate like Hampton, Norfolk, Petersburg and Portsmouth. Northam also swept rural counties with majority black populations like Brunswick, Charles City, Greensville and Sussex. In all of these jurisdictions, Northam won more than 70% of the vote.", "Higher turnout for Democrats", "Roughly 542,000 ballots were cast in the Democratic primary and the GOP contest tallied some 366,000 votes. Virginia has almost 5.5 million registered voters, so the combined turnout was almost 17%. This is the first time since 1949 that both parties have conducted a primary for the same gubernatorial election, so turnout comparisons are difficult to make. In 2009, the last time the Democrats held a contested gubernatorial primary, just over 319,000 votes were cast. In 2005, Republicans held a noncompetitive primary for governor and some 175,000 ballots were tallied. In the 2013 gubernatorial general election, roughly 43% of the state's registered voters went to the polls."]},

But, as ", "Bernie Sanders", " reiterated in a recent podcast with me, the problem is that people have ceased to see a difference between the parties, particularly on economic issues. I'll briefly cite a few examples.", "Starting out with NAFTA, Bill Clinton forced \"", "free trade", "\" upon the party. I warned multiple times during the election that Trump would make inroads with voters in the Rust Belt unless Democrats ", "made a clean break", " from corporate trade deals. Around the globe, these deals are a key tool to drive down wages, exploit workers and prosecute global class warfare. But, the current president still serves up the malarkey about the benefits of these deals.", "Bill Clinton's broader economic agenda was even more corrosive. During Clinton's so-called \"good economy,\" the decline of organized labor continued. The president, and his secretary of labor, Robert Reich, did very little to arrest the decline. ", "No Democratic president was more focused on letting business interests off the leash. He gave more power to media companies, triggering consolidation and a powerful wave of concentration of the media into a few hands. The average person, not steeped in policy, understood this every time he or she opened their skyrocketing cable bills. ", "Hand-in-glove with Wall Street, Clinton got rid of the Glass Steagall Act, which removed the separation between commercial banks, insurers and investment banks, allowing the self-dealing manipulation of mortgages and interest  rates and accelerating the shifting of huge wealth into the hands of a few. ", "Again, the average person, just trying to make ends meet, eventually got the sharpest end of that spear when millions of people lost their homes, jobs and retirement in the thundering collapse known as the Great Recession, which, for many, has been a depression.", "There is so much more: A planet dying because for years fossil fuel interests were coddled. Welfare reform. Mass incarceration of people of color, which had both racial and economic consequences. The praise of the Clinton years, and red-faced defense by its leader, was always couched in contrast to the Reagan and two Bush Administrations. Great.", "Feeding off the Clinton machine, the Democratic Party has become riddled with lobbyists, billionaires, and hustlers who pocket huge sums of money by running either nonprofit \"think tanks\" or election-cycle networks, and politicians who, indeed, are focused mostly on reelection. Surrounding the party are extremely well-paid non-profit leaders, who end up defending the status quo.", "Chief component of the Clinton machine in recent years, the Clinton Foundation operated somewhat out of sight. ", "The big donations streaming from anti-union powerhouses like Wal-Mart or big financial entities like Bank of America not only whitewashed the policies of interests directly opposed to what the Democratic Party should stand for, but they also clouded the deeper systemic crisis within the party. We can only address climate change, poverty and global inequality by axing the very system benefiting many of the donors to the Clinton Foundation.", "Fast forward to the 2016 election. There is", " no doubt in my mind", " that Bernie Sanders would have defeated Trump. His authenticity would have pierced through Trump's fraudulent appeal. His concise, point-by-point evisceration of a failed economic model and aggressive, blundering foreign policy was entirely understandable to voters.", "As one of Sen. Sanders' national surrogates, I went to dozens of his rallies. At each one, he took to the stage, a big sheaf of papers in his hands, and, treating people as adults not just backdrops for TV ads, he conducted a seminar on America and the globe. People are quite familiar with Sanders' economic agenda, including higher taxes on the wealthy, expanding Social Security and a single-payer Medicare for All system. All of which were sound economically, not to mention morally urgent.", "What was often given short shrift was his broader philosophical willingness to challenge American exceptionalism. Many times, including during two national debates, he pointed out that, while he was proud as a son of immigrants to be an American, this country has supported repressive dictators, sent the CIA on missions to help overthrow democratically elected governments that were not supportive enough of our interests and sent our young men and women to die in immoral wars. And he wasn't afraid to point out that those failed foreign policies have been bedrocks of the Democratic Party for several decades. ", "Rather than foster a good debate during the primaries, the party, obsessed with the coronation of an anointed candidate, set out to destroy Sanders and his movement. ", "The various email leaks showing broad collusion only confirmed what was patently obvious on the surface: We stood in opposition to a virtual wall of elected Democratic officials, and party functionaries. Proudly so, I might add. ", "As a union member, I was particularly saddened to see the labor movement mostly line up in the primaries behind the status quo \u2014 a status quo often linked arm-and-arm with corporate interests bent on destroying unions.", "Beyond rhetoric, democracy was not valued. Once Sanders effectively conceded the race, he took on full-throated advocacy for Secretary Clinton. To support his position, many of us, including me, agreed to play nice at the convention and beyond, because we felt that Donald Trump was a unique threat to the nation.", "On the night Tim Kaine spoke to the convention, many Sanders delegates like me wanted to express respectful opposition to President Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement by holding signs. But, our signs were confiscated, and, when we made some homemade versions on the back of the officially-sanctioned Kaine signs, we were told to cease and desist or our credentials would be revoked. So much for democracy.", "More important, that gagging of pretty mild protest was symbolic. The party is not an open place, beyond rhetoric, to a whole swath of activists and voters who want deep, systemic change.", "So, now what? Yesterday was indeed devastating. My niece texted me, \"what do we do now?\" Her desperate question broke my heart. I grew up in a feminist household: My mother was one of a handful of women to break a glass ceiling, going to medical school after she already had her three kids. ", "I know many young women are mourning the blow of a President Trump partly because of the rejection of a woman as the first president -- which is yet another reason I argue we must remake the Democratic Party. ", "First, the Clinton machine must be rooted out of the party. A quarter of a century is enough time to understand that its ideology has failed the American people. ", "Second, the Democratic National Committee has to be turned inside out. The disgraced and deposed chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, is only the worst symptom of this wider truth. The party has lost hundreds of state legislative seats, Republicans now control two-thirds of state chambers and have a comfortable majority of governorships (who will determine redistricting in 2020). They have a historic margin in the House of Representatives, will continue to run the Senate and, thus, likely put a Trump-stamp on the Supreme Court. ", "Third, we need to run targeted primary contests broadly and across the board to replace elected officials who don't want to see a more open, vibrant and inclusive party. The Sanders movement has shown we can raise the money to fund challengers \u2014 and they are ready, by the thousands, to compete.", "With these changes, and drawing from the energy of many great activists, a new Democratic Party can be revitalized. The progressive movement, in all its elements \u2014 advocates for labor, environmentalists, and civil rights of all stripes \u2014 can shape that future."]},

Nevertheless, it is difficult to know that a young black man composed it during some of the worst years of Jim Crow in America and not see it at once as a political rallying cry despite its sentimentality. ", "But the dream was a marinating, evolving motif in Hughes' work. It would achieve its most mature form probably in the popular \"Harlem.\" That work begins with the question \"What happens to a dream deferred?\" and ends with the threat \"Or does it explode?\"", "The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. would pick up on Hughes' dream imagery in his most celebrated oration, which we remember for its recurrent assertion \"I Have a Dream.\" That speech underscored his hopes for an America that would conquer social injustice ingrained into our daily life as a consequence of slavery.", "One is reminded also of Hughes' militant anthem of the Great Depression, \"Let America Be America Again,\" which appeared in 1936: (America \"never was America to me,\" and yet America \"must be.\")", "Introducing Clinton, Kaine paired the sentimentality of Hughes with something much more muscular, and even menacing. With his invocation of Wash Jones' defiant line -- \"They kilt us but they ain't whupped us yit\" -- from Faulkner's 1936 novel, \"Absalom, Absalom!\" -- one is tempted to say that Kaine in a sense brought a bayonet to what had been a war of words. It's a strange turnaround, and an odd application of the deeper lessons of the Civil War, but one that makes sense. Kaine is from Virginia, where they live and breathe this sense of American history and its symbolism. ", "The grand fight now is for the future of America. Kaine was reminding his and Clinton's people that their election loss was only one setback, like Bull Run, when the South routed Union forces and terrified many people in the North, but it is not the end of the war.  ", "The courage of the rebel South in the Civil War is distinct from the pro-slavery goals of that same rebel South. In a paradoxical reprising of what took place in America in the 1860s, the remarkable courage of the rebel South is there to be invoked and emulated in what his and Clinton's supporters must often see as a primal battle, a new civil war, for the soul and state of America.

", "The fear is that a thoroughly erratic president could, in a moment of pique order, or even as a distraction, embark on an adventure that would set the nation and the world on an irreversible course that Congress would be powerless to halt. ", "The still-undisclosed powers contained in the Trump memo could spark unanticipated skirmishes like the ambush in Niger last October, leaving dead Americans in their wake. At the other end of the spectrum, they might unleash events that could lead potentially to a nuclear holocaust.

Any of these could quickly develop into full-blown nuclear war.", "What this means is that Trump's war powers memo, appropriately scrubbed for any classified \"sources and methods,\" needs to see the full light of day, deserves a full national debate and discussion, even Congressional action.

A boon for Democrats"], "articles_text": ["Akhil Reed Amar is a professor of constitutional law at Yale University and the author of \"", "The Constitution Today", ".\"  The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. ", " (CNN)", "Several leading Republicans are ", "suggesting", " that if Hillary Clinton is elected, she could be ", "impeached", " sometime after inauguration, perhaps in her first year as president.  ", "Echoing these allies, Donald Trump is arguing that a prospect of ", "impeachment ", "over the Clinton email controversy or any other Clinton misdeed would mire America in a ", "constitutional crisis,", " and thus he (and ", "he alone", ") is America's salvation.", "Savvy Democrats should respond to Trump's hyperkinetic attack with jujitsu, using his own furious momentum to expose yet another example of his constitutional clumsiness.", "First, Democrats should smile and coolly point out that there is no need for Republicans to wait until inauguration. Why not start the grand impeachment parade now?  ", "Casual observers can be forgiven for assuming -- wrongly, as it turns out -- that Clinton can be impeached only for presidential misconduct, and that of course no such misconduct has occurred because she has yet to be president. But in fact, the Constitution's Article II makes all \"civil officers of the United States\" and not just presidents subject to impeachment. True, senators and representatives are not impeachable as such. Technically, they are not \"officers\" within the Constitution's letter and spirit, as illustrated by the language of Article I, Section 6: \"No person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.\"  ", "Precisely because senators cannot \"hold Office\" under this Article I clause, Clinton was constitutionally required to leave the Senate when she became secretary of state in 2009. But as secretary of state she was indeed an \"officer\" and as such, subject to impeachment. Private citizens as such cannot be impeached, nor can members of Congress as such. But Cabinet officers in their capacity as Cabinet officers are fair game in impeachment.", "The punishment", "True, Clinton is no longer a Cabinet officer. She is currently a private citizen. But the logic and spirit of Article II make former Cabinet officers fully impeachable, as are other former officers of the US government -- ex-presidents, ex-vice presidents, former judges and former justices, for example.  Why? Because the punishment for impeachment can extend beyond simple removal from office.  Under Article I, Section 3, \"judgment in cases of impeachment\" may include \"disqualification to hold or enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States.\"  ", "Surely an evil officer should not be allowed to escape disqualification by resigning one minute before the sentencing gavel bangs down at the end of his impeachment trial in the Senate. And what is true of someone who resigns one minute ahead of time must also be true of anyone who leaves office at any earlier point -- resigning, perhaps, precisely because the evil officer knows that his misconduct is about to come to light.", "So Hillary Clinton can indeed be impeached -- now, or any time before Inauguration. She can be impeached for any of her allegedly malignant misdeeds as secretary of state -- whatever those misdeeds might be, in the eyes of her House Republican critics. And the standard for impeachment and conviction is not that she committed a statute-book felony beyond reasonable doubt -- the pro-Clinton standard that FBI Director James Comey propounded back in July when he said that any criminal charges against her would be preposterous (a fact that Trump ignores at every turn). Rather, the standard in impeachment is more intrinsically political. Malicious mischief in office is impeachable even if no felony ever occurred, and the standard of proof need not, perhaps, be as high as in a criminal courtroom. ", "All this should be music to the ears of Republican extremists: If convicted after she is impeached, Clinton can be completely disqualified from the presidency itself! Trump supporters would say: Hurray for the Constitution! Hooray for the rule of law! Our republic is safe after all.", "First flaw in the GOP argument", "But at this point, savvy Democrats should explain two further constitutional points to Trump and to the American public whom Trump is seeking to woo with his glib talk of impeachment.  ", "First, impeachment by the House is an empty gesture unless the Senate follows up with a conviction -- or at least with a trial in which conviction is a realistic possibility -- and scenarios in which the Senate would follow up are altogether fanciful.  ", "Partisan impeachments by the House of Representatives are indeed allowed under the strict letter of the Constitution. The House needs only the barest of majorities to impeach -- in effect, indict -- a sitting or former officer. But nothing horrible really happens to the impeached officer -- no removal from office, and no disqualification from future office-holding -- unless the Senate convicts, and the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote for conviction.  ", "Given that Republicans are now and will for the foreseeable future be more than a dozen votes shy of two-thirds, Clinton would only be imperiled if Democrats turn against her. But current Republican extremists are of course solidifying Democratic solidarity behind her. Democrats are, almost to a person, \"with her,\" as the slogan goes -- and with her all the more because extremist Republicans are so intently and unfairly against her.", "Hillary Clinton's option", "And here is the second, even bigger, constitutional flaw in Trump's argument. Should future Republican extremists be so heavy-handed as to try to impeach her, a future President Hillary Clinton could call their bluff by stepping down, temporarily, under the provisions of the 25th", " ", "Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment, adopted after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, allows a sitting president to step aside temporarily at any time and for virtually any reason he or she deems proper -- a planned surgery, a family crisis, a political row. Formally, the impeachment process in this scenario would stay precisely on track, unimpaired by this temporary step-aside -- just as if Clinton had not stepped aside on the one hand or had resigned on the other.  ", "By stepping down, temporarily, under this amendment, Clinton would make her loyal running mate, Tim Kaine, the acting president of the United States. Republicans have nothing on Kaine, and by taking over the reins for a while, he would actually improve his chances of being elected president in his own right in 2020 or beyond.  ", "So by giving Clinton a good excuse to boost Kaine, Republicans would be making their own prospects that much harder in future presidential elections, and doubly so -- by looking (and being) themselves extreme and partisan and by making Kaine look (and be) all the more presidential.  Kaine is after all, in some ways a superior version of Clinton -- younger and with less baggage, but utterly loyal to the general Clinton policy agenda. And nothing would stop acting President Kaine from consulting the vacationing Clinton at every turn.", "Indeed, if Clinton truly wanted to stick it to her critics and make them eat crow, she could smilingly step aside, temporarily, and make it clear that she will formally resume power and take back the reins under the 25th Amendment only if her critics themselves formally recant and ask her -- beg her! -- to put Kaine back in the second slot. (Kaine himself reacted to the impeachment talk by ", "pointing out ", "that Republicans who engage in it are suggesting it's likely their candidate will lose to Clinton.) ", "Once we understand how a clever President Clinton would and should react to overheated Republican extremists, we see how Trump and his allies are -- as they so often are -- mistaken in their bullheaded constitutional claims. No crisis need ensue should Clinton be impeached or should serious impeachment rumblings ever occur. Clinton herself has ensured this by picking a sound, steady and policy-compatible running mate fully capable of being president at any moment -- possessing precisely the sober presidential temperament, extensive training and cool judgment that Trump himself obviously lacks, as evidenced by his latest rampage.", "Wielding power by giving it up", "Sometimes, the best way to wield power is, at first, to give it up. Caesar at first pushed away the diadem and George Washington immortalized himself with brilliantly executed resignations (first from the Continental Army, later from the presidency itself). Back when Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998, I ", "argued ", "in the New Republic  that he should publicly step aside under the 25th Amendment and let Al Gore take over for a while. Many readers thought I was being cutesy, but I was in dead earnest.  ", "Such a move, I argued back then, could have helped both Clinton and Gore. Indeed I claimed in early 1999 that a Clinton-to-Gore handoff under the 25th Amendment could improve Gore's chances to be elected in his own right in 2000. With the benefit of hindsight, I think I called it right.  (I tell the back story in my new ", "book", ".) ", "The last president Clinton, when impeached, declined my free advice. (He was acquitted by the Senate, saw his approval ratings go up and served out his full term.)  The next president Clinton, should she too be impeached, should do what her husband didn't: step aside, temporarily, and boost the veep. But for now, my most important piece of advice is to my fellow citizens who will soon head to the polls: Pay no attention to Trump's latest sales pitch that because she might be impeached, we must instead vote for him. Here as on many other topics, Trump has not thought things through and does not know what he is talking about."]},

", "The Trump administration briefed reporters and supporters on its ", "proposal Thursday", ": offering a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children and asking for $25 billion for border security including infrastructure. ", "If that were all that was on the table, a deal might already be at hand. In fact, Democrats were mostly prepared to agree to such a proposal, which could have lined up some moderate Republicans as well. ", "But the deal also included two other \"pillars,\" as the White House has called them: family-based migration and the diversity visa lottery. In addition, the administration proposal included a number of \"legal loopholes\" it wants to close in the border security pillar beyond physical security -- a repackaged effort to expand federal immigration authorities. ", "Taken together, those efforts would amount to a dramatic reshaping of the legal immigration system -- one that will be far more complicated to negotiate on Capitol Hill. ", "Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas agreed Thursday before the White House announcement that the elements of the deal beyond pure border security were arguably more complicated. ", "\"I think they probably are,\" he said, adding that with more understanding he thought they could be negotiable.", "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is part of a bipartisan Senate group working to find common ground on the issue, had said earlier Thursday that while a full border wall is not acceptable, a major investment in border security is. ", "\"I trust big investment. I've voted for that already,\" Kaine said. \"When you can patrol a border better with drones and sensors, the wall may not be the best way. But that we would make a big investment in it? The Dems are there already.\"", "GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said the issue of family migration comes up if the undocumented population covered by the bill is granted citizenship -- and that leads down a difficult road. ", "\"if you do that, you have to address the issue of chain migration, and that's where it becomes a lot more complicated. So we've got our work cut out for us,\" Rounds said upon leaving the morning bipartisan meeting. ", "Thorny proposals", "The White House proposal would limit family sponsorship to spouses and minor children, eliminating a number of existing categories including adult children, both married and unmarried; parents of adult US citizens; and siblings of adult US citizens. Experts have estimated that cutting these categories would reduce the roughly 1 million green cards given out yearly by 25% to 50%. ", "At first, the Trump proposal would use the green cards from the eliminated categories -- plus the 50,000 from the eliminated diversity visa lottery -- to work through a backlog of millions of people waiting in a line upward of 30 years long for their green cards. The bill does extend an olive branch to the left in not making the cuts retroactive -- meaning anyone already in line would still be eligible. Groups on the right are outraged that the plan would mean potentially 10 to 20 years before cuts to immigration begin. ", "But Democrats are unlikely to accept such a sweeping cut in legal immigration at all. And cutting the diversity visa lottery is not as straightforward as some believe -- especially to members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other affinity caucuses, who are ", "vocal about the importance of immigration from lesser represented countries", ". ", "And the framework includes vague references to closing \"legal loopholes,\" as a White House official put it on a briefing call, as part of the border security pillar -- perhaps one of the biggest poison pills of the deal. ", "The White House released only a top-line overview of what it was seeking -- what it characterized as \"closing the loopholes\" to more easily detain and deport immigrants. But a document obtained by CNN that goes into more detail, which the Department of Homeland Security has been providing to lawmakers in meetings, and the descriptions released by the White House suggest it will pursue aggressive changes.", "In addressing \"catch-and-release,\" as the White House put it, the framework could allow detaining individuals indefinitely as they await deportation for months and years -- something that has been curtailed as the result of constitutional concerns from courts. The proposals could also vastly expand the definitions of criminal offenses that could subject an individual to deportation. ", "All the efforts to more aggressively deport and reject undocumented immigrants could be anathema to Democrats and some moderate Republicans. ", "\"I am a lot less interested in things that have the effect of distorting family relationships or splitting up families, and border security is less likely to do that,\" said Democrat Michael Bennet of Colorado, who has long pursued an immigration compromise. ", "\"It's crazy,\" said Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. \"This is not an easy negotiation, but we should move on the things we all agree on.\"", "Support for a simpler deal", "The realities of trying to sort through the complicated issues the White House is looking to attach to a deal on the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program are leading lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to suggest paring down the negotiations to just two pillars: DACA and physical border security. ", "\"We all need to understand that there are two things that are critical,\" Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, said as she was leaving the bipartisan group. \"Dealing with the Dreamers, because we're up against (a) March deadline, and dealing with border security. We all agree we need border security. We need more definitional work done on border security.\"", "Kaine agreed, saying there's a need to be realistic. ", "\"There's all kinds of issues I want to fix, I just think it's probably going to be easier to start with the two pillars,\" he said. ", "Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, one of the leading forces in the bipartisan group, was also vocal about a narrow approach. ", "\"We don't have to solve the entire problem of legal immigration in this bill,\" Alexander told CNN. \"All we really have to do is focus on the young people who were brought here illegally through no fault of their own, and border security. Sometimes taking small steps in the right direction is a good way to get where you want to go.\""]},

", "Jones benefited from the unique vulnerabilities of his opponent, Republican Roy Moore, who was a deeply polarizing figure even before he was besieged by allegations that he had pursued relationships with teenage girls, some of them underage, while in his 30s. ", "But the coalition that Jones mobilized closely resembled the voter alignments that have powered other recent Democratic victories in governors' races in Virginia, North Carolina and Louisiana. Above all, Jones demonstrated that Democrats could simultaneously inspire passionate turnout from their base supporters, led by African-Americans, and make inroads with centrist white-collar white voters -- each of which, for different reasons, is recoiling from Donald Trump's tumultuous presidency. That combination allowed Jones to overcome Moore's lopsided margins among blue-collar, evangelical, older and rural whites -- the four building blocks of the Trump coalition. ", "Keeping momentum and agreement among those groups won't be easy, but Democrats see it as a possible pathway to majorities in the 2018 midterm elections. ", "\"It was definitely the most complicated, toughest thing I've ever been through, on the edge of your seat,\" said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic strategist who directed Jones' campaign. \"[But] Trump has created this middle ground where enough moderate and conservative Republicans and Democrats really want leadership about coming together and getting something done. ... I think that is the winning message of 2018.\" ", "Jones' victory was centered on minorities, millennial voters and college-educated suburban whites, especially women. That's exactly the formula Democrats now depend on in most states. But even with strong African-American support, Southern Democrats until recently come up short, largely because they haven't attracted nearly as many college-educated whites as their party does elsewhere.  ", "Now, with Democratic constituencies energized and suburban swing voters uneasy about Trump, Southern Democrats are suddenly finding it more possibe to assemble the coalition that the party relies on in other regions. And that could create new opportunities for Democrats across the South, most immediately in suburban House districts in 2018, but potentially also in statewide contests such as the 2018 governor's race in Georgia and Senate battle in Tennessee.  ", "\"I am not going to say that any place is going to be noncompetitive next year,\" says Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who has long specialized in Southern races. \"It all depends on the environment and how it shifts over the course of the next year, but it's hard to see it getting a whole lot more favorable for Republicans with Donald Trump as the face of the party.\" ", "Democrats still face a long road to re-establishing competitiveness across the South. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in all 11 states of the old Confederacy except for Virginia, typically by enormous margins. (Only a year before Jones' win, Trump carried Alabama by nearly 28 percentage points and 590,000 votes.) Even after Jones' win, Democrats still hold just four of the region's 22 Senate seats (including Mark Warner and Tim Kaine in Virginia and Bill Nelson in Florida). And Democrats control just three of the 11 Southern governor's mansions.  ", "Yet Jones' victory continued a modest Southern Democratic revival that includes those three governor wins: one in 2017 (Ralph Northam in Virginia), one in 2016 (Roy Cooper in North Carolina) and the last in 2015 (John Bel Edwards in Louisiana.) ", " ", "Even as they embraced most traditional Democratic priorities -- such as expanding access to Medicaid, defending the Affordable Care Act and ensuring equal treatment for gays -- each of those four candidates ran primarily as a consensus-builder in an increasingly polarized age.  ", "While defending the ACA, opposing the GOP tax plan and affirming his support for legal abortion, Jones promised to seek common ground where possible with Trump and Republicans -- a message he repeated on CNN's \"State of the Union\" this Sunday. The most memorable television ad of Jones' campaign was a spot called \"Honor\" in which, speaking directly to the camera, he praised \"two brave men\" who fought on the Confederate and Union sides at Gettysburg during the Civil War and declared, \"There is honor in compromise and civility.\" ", "Trippi said Jones faced criticism from some Democratic activists who wanted a more pugnacious approach to Trump. But, he added, there was no evidence that Jones' call for common ground depressed turnout among the core Democratic groups. \"That message didn't keep the lid on our own energy and excitement,\" Trippi said. \"You get more angst from activist leaders than you do [from] voters. You gain far more than [you lose from] the few loud voices that don't like working with the other side.\" ", "Indeed, Jones achieved two broad campaign goals that some on the left have viewed as incompatible. ", "On the one hand, he was buoyed by big turnouts and huge margins among core Democratic constituencies. That was especially true among African-Americans, who made up slightly more of the vote, and voted slightly more heavily Democratic, last week than they did when President Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012, according to exit polls. But Jones also benefited from respectable turnout and a commanding margin among young voters, who gave him fully three-fifths of their votes. (He received a thumb on the scale, too, from the 5% of voters who were neither white nor black, a reflection of the increasing Hispanic, Asian and mixed race presence throughout the Southeast.) ", "John Anzalone, an Alabama-based Democratic pollster who worked on an independent expenditure effort supporting Jones, says that while Moore won very high percentages in his rural strongholds, they could not match the enhanced turnout in more urbanized Democratic-leaning areas. \"We turned out where we had to turn out our voters, and even though he did really well in his strongholds the turnout wasn't big enough,\" Anzalone said. \"We are getting people who have never come out in a midterm or special election, and they are disproportionately our people.\" ", "Jones also made deeper inroads among white-collar white voters, such as those in suburbs around Huntsville and Birmingham, than Southern Democrats have usually achieved. In 2016, for instance, exit polls showed that Clinton carried 45% of college-educated whites nationally but only about one-third or less in Florida, Texas and Georgia. In 2014, Democratic Senate candidates didn't win more than one-third of college-educated whites in any Southern state with an exit poll except North Carolina and Virginia. In 2012, the last time an exit poll was conducted in Alabama, Obama won only one-fifth of college-educated whites there. ", "Last week, though, the exit poll found that Jones won 40% of college-educated whites in Alabama, double Obama's share. That reaffirmed the movement evident in the Virginia race, where Northam reached 51% among college-educated whites, considerably more than Democrats had garnered in any recent statewide race there. Although exit polls weren't available in the June special election for a suburban House seat outside of Atlanta, Democrat Jon Ossoff could not have finished so close to Republican Karen Handel, the narrow winner, without significant gains among those voters too. ", "The movement toward Southern Democrats this year has been greatest among college-educated white women in both Virginia (where Northam carried 58% of them) and Alabama (where Jones took 45%). But each gained substantially among well-educated men too.  ", "Ayres says the intense distaste for Trump among college-educated white women represents a clear and present danger for any Republican who must court a heavily suburban constituency, even in the South. \"If you put Alabama together with Virginia, it's very clear that college-educated suburban women are rejecting Trump and his style and what he has brought to the country,\" Ayres said. \"[This] is a logical extension of the patterns we saw in the presidential election in 2016. Republicans traded fast growing, large, better-educated counties for slow growing, smaller less well-educated counties. And it was a trade that worked well for Trump, barely, in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, but it's hardly a formula for long-term success.\" ", "Even amid these gains, the big blinking yellow light for Democrats is the continuing Republican hold on the blue-collar, evangelical and rural voters who play such a large role in many Southern states. Trippi said that while Trump's combative persona helped mobilize African-Americans and young people, and enlarged the opening for Jones with white-collar whites, the President showed a potent capacity to tug his coalition back toward Moore whenever it appeared to waver. \"He has this weird thing where he would help fuel our positive message [on working together] and then he would roll in and create the tribalism that would help them all move back to Moore,\" Trippi said.  ", "Still, Jones -- like Ralph Northam and Roy Cooper before him -- wasn't annihilated among working-class white voters by quite as large a margin as Clinton or Obama or most Southern Democratic Senate candidates in 2014. Trippi said the campaign's research found that Trump's \"divisive negative style ... was starting to wear even on\" those voters, who have been Trump's most loyal. ", "Democrats still face many obstacles in the South. But Trump's turbulent presidency may be creating more opportunity than almost anyone anticipated for the party to begin overcoming them."]},

Christie now faces a political future filled with not-so-good options. He almost certainly can't run for office in New Jersey for a very long time to come and his close association with Trump has hurt him badly in the eyes of GOP establishment types.

", " (CNN)", "Democrat Ralph Northam's convincing 54%-45% victory over Republican Ed Gillespie in the Virginia governor's race underscores the challenge that many GOP candidates may face in urban and suburban communities in the midterm elections next year, especially if President Donald Trump's popularity continues to sag.", "According to a CNN exit poll of Virginia voters after they cast their ballots, nearly 3 out of 5 disapproved of the job that Trump is doing. That is almost identical to President Barack Obama's negative standing among Virginia voters in 2014, when Gillespie, then the Republican nominee for Senate, came within 22,000 votes, less than a percentage point, of upsetting the popular Democratic incumbent, Mark Warner. With nearly all the precincts reporting, Gillespie lost to Northam by more than 232,000 votes.", "Nowhere was the metropolitan advantage greater for Northam than in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington DC. Overall, the Democrat won nearly 68% of the vote, eclipsing the 64% mark set by Hillary Clinton in last year's presidential race and easily exceeding the 57% that Warner captured in 2014 and the 58% that Democrat Terry McAuliffe scored when he won the 2013 gubernatorial contest. Moreover, turnout rose in Northern Virginia in relation to the rest of the state: the region, which includes Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William Counties, and the Democratic bastion of Alexandria, accounted for roughly 30% of the statewide vote, up from 28% in the 2013 governor's race. Gillespie's 31% showing in Fairfax, the largest vote-producing county in the state, is not only less than his 40% tally in 2014, it's less than the 36% that Republican Ken Cuccinelli, a conservative hard-liner, garnered in the 2013 gubernatorial contest.", "In Loudoun and Prince William, Northam bested Gillespie, 60%-40% and 61%-38%, respectively. In his 2014 Senate race, Gillespie narrowly won Loudoun with 49% of the vote and was bested by Warner in Prince William by only 50-48%. Even in the distant exurbs of Stafford County, which Virginia Republicans have won by commanding margins in recent years, Gillespie only edged Northam by 52%-47%. ", "But the blue tide in the suburbs and exurbs extended well beyond the Capital Beltway. In the Hampton Roads area, which includes Norfolk and Virginia Beach, Northam defeated Gillespie 60%-38%, again besting the margins scored by Clinton, Warner and McAuliffe. Northam became the first top statewide Democratic candidate to carry both of the suburban battlegrounds of Chesapeake and Virginia Beach in a non-presidential year (when Democratic turnout traditionally ebbs) since Democrat Tim Kaine captured the governorship in 2005.", "Even in metro areas in rural parts of the state, Northam performed exceeding well. In the city of Harrisonburg, in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley and in the middle of ruby red Rockingham County, Northam won 64%-35%. And while Harrisonburg is Democratic turf, it saw the largest Democratic gain on a percentage point basis (11.2) of any city or county in Virginia over the party's performance in the 2013 governor's race. And in Chesterfield County, the Republican suburbs of Richmond that GOP candidates usually carry with ease, Gillespie barely won by less than 300 votes. ", "Gillespie did perform well in rural counties in western and central Virginia, but even here there was a downside. In the 15 counties where Democratic percentages fell the most from the 2013 governor's race, all in the mountain west region of the state, only one, Lee County in the extreme southwest corner of the state, saw its total vote tally noticeably rise from 2013. In all the rest, the total vote was flat or fell slightly. This was one election where rural voters could not save a Republican who was hemorrhaging votes all across the metropolitan landscape."]},

", "Vigilante action", "But Murphy's descriptions of the way the violence started clearly angered lawmakers. Murphy said the most recent wave of violence that has sent so many fleeing across the border to Bangladesh was the result of a \"disproportionate\" response by the military to a Rohingya militant attack. He said that there is also evidence the military has been associated with \"vigilante\" attacks. ", "\"When I think of vigilante action, I think of sort of rogue individuals not connected with the government doing things,\" said Sen.

Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the committee, to say that ethnic cleansing is taking place, Murphy said that he wasn't in a position to make that determination, but that it was under consideration.", "\"In the meantime, we conclude that there have been atrocities, massive displacement, depopulation of villages that cause us great concern,\" Murphy said. \"We are pursuing all avenues for accountability.

", "The race has been framed as a reboot of the Bernie Sanders-Hillary Clinton contest, but the comparison is not a perfect fit.

Gillespie has successfully tiptoed around the presence of Trump, embracing his policies that are popular with Republicans without directly tying his campaign to the President.

Stewart has waged a campaign to protect Confederate monuments around the state and was the only candidate to not outright reject an alt-right rally in Charlottesville organized by white nationalist Richard Spencer.

", "The energetic candidate is hoping his effective media strategy and relentless campaign schedule (he spent the weekend before the primary on a 24-hour get-out-the-vote swing) will turn the tide. A little more than 319,000 Democrats turned out in a three-way primary in 2009.  Absentee ballot applications are up significantly as compared to previous gubernatorial elections, which could indicate a higher than usual overall turnout. ", "A variety of Virginia politicos to whom CNN spoke peg the magic number at 375,000 voters -- above that number could be good for Perriello, but below that should indicate a Northam win.

Warner, Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Sen. Tim Kaine have stuck by the lieutenant governor, whom all three have known and served with for a long time.

He's currently running a TV ad that features Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former President Barack Obama singing his praises. Sanders and Warren have formally endorsed Perriello in this race, though Obama has not. It is the kind of ad that could compel a Democrat who normally only participates in presidential contests to make the effort to vote in Tuesday's primary.  ", "Gillespie, meanwhile, has locked in support from Republican Party leaders from top to bottom in Virginia, but what he doesn't have -- and what he hasn't sought -- is the support of the sitting Republican president. ", "In 2009 and 2013, Obama not only endorsed but held rallies in support of the Democratic candidates in Virginia. That was, of course, after the primary, but there is no sign Gillespie will be in search in the same kind of lift from Washington in 2017.

Dominion has long been a major donor to both Republicans and Democrats, and in 2017, the company has donated to both Northam and Gillespie's campaigns.", "But not only did Perriello not take their money, he has vowed to stop the company's efforts to build pipelines in the state. Northam has taken a more cautious approach on the pipeline, calling for a rigorous review before they are built without outright rejecting the proposal. Perriello is hoping Virginia progressives view his move as a signal that he will rid corporate influence from the governor's mansion -- a task that will be much easier said than done.", "National reaction to the outcome", "No matter what happens on Tuesday, national political prognosticators are going to attempt to draw a grand conclusion on what the result tells us about American voters in the era of Trump. Chances are those conclusions will be a stretch. We may get a glimpse of Democratic enthusiasm, but it will still be an incredibly small sample size. The Virginia primary electorate is fickle, unpredictable and varies greatly depending on the year. Any attempt to use the results as a basis for predictions about the direction of the country are at best premature. It may not even offer much of a signal about what to expect from Virginia voters in November."]},

He understands the blueprint for crafting a message that speaks to disaffected white voters, while also giving voters of color a full-throated reason to come out and vote for his campaign. ", "Democrats clearly made mistakes in 2016; we cannot win by simply ignoring rural America. The frustration from white working-class voters is palpable and just. Our government has failed them, too. However, African-American voters, especially in the South, understand that they do not have the luxury to choose between economic justice and racial justice.  These issues must be coupled together. One without the other is useless.", "Perriello has not only called for a \"", "Commission on Racial Healing and Transformation", ",\" but he's gone even further: \"We have to call out racism structural and overt where we see it, and we have to continue to address the issues of deep racial inequality we have here in Virginia, where the median net worth of an African-American family remains 1/11th that of a median white family in Virginia.  We must deal with the structural barriers and have these conversations even when they're uncomfortable.\"   ", "This sentiment does not just apply to Virginia, though.

In 2012, the Census Bureau said black voters for the first time voted at a ", "higher share", " than non-Hispanic whites. Contrast that to 2016 black voter turnout, when turnout was down across the board, including swing states like Virginia. If black turnout in these states reached 2012 levels, the result might have been President Clinton and not President Trump.", "Self-reflection and growth is hard, and it takes time.

While Trump aides have said some of his statements shouldn't be taken \"literally,\" the tweets offer insight to his foreign policy views and raise a question: When both China and Russia are challenging US power globally, why does he favor Moscow and not Beijing?", "Trump's positions on Russia and China mark a sharp turn from current policies -- and that might to the point. Trump and much of the Republican establishment have made clear they aim to dismantle parts of President Barack Obama's legacy. Trump is also looking to use international relations in pursuit of economic ends, even as some observers worry his approach is based on misperceptions of economic forces.  ", "Some analysts point to the possibility that Trump is taking a deeply strategic approach; others say he simply fails to understand the crucial importance of long-standing US alliances. At the least, it is an approach that contrasts with Obama, who has tried to find areas of common interest with China to bridge serious divides. At the same time, he has endeavored, with little success, to isolate Russia for a series of international violations.", "\"It's a sign of confusion if you're making trouble with the Chinese at the same time as you're making trouble with US allies in Asia, and it's a sign of confusion if you're trying to make up with Russia at the same that you're not tending to American alliances in Europe,\" said Steven Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.", "Trump \"acts like a guy who thinks he can make everybody mad at the same time and not pay a price for it,\" Sestanovich said. ", "Russia has conducted a stealth invasion of Ukraine, annexed Crimea -- the first attempt to alter European borders by force since World War II -- and is believed to have supplied the missile that brought down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, shot down over Ukraine in 2014.", "Moscow has supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war, including in the bombing of civilians in Aleppo, in direct opposition to the US. The Russian military has buzzed US aircraft and ships. And the US intelligence community found with \"high confidence\" that Russia was behind hacking during the presidential election campaign meant to sow doubts about American democracy. ", "And yet Trump speaks warmly of Putin and his desire for better cooperation with Russia, publicly dismissing the hacking allegations and accusing the intelligence community of acting politically.", "That stand has damaged morale within the intelligence community and puzzled observers who wonder whether it's a strategic decision or a function of Trump's admiration for authoritarian figures, possible business deals with Russian oligarchs, or as-yet-undiscovered links or financial debts. Russian officials have said they were in contact with the Trump campaign throughout the election. ", "RELATED: Trump attacks set intelligence community on edge", "Matt Rojansky, head of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center, said one reason could be Trump's belief that the US should do more work with Russia to defeat terrorism and his view of that challenge as a \"civilizational battle between radical Islam and, broadly speaking, the forces of Western civilization.\"", "Trump and his aides, particularly his future national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, are much more comfortable including Russia under the \"Western civilization\" umbrella than prominent Republicans such as Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Rojansky said. That will cause friction, possibly sooner rather than later.", "McCain will hold hearings Thursday to examine Russia's role in the election hacking. The Arizona senator and Graham have announced that they will also lead new sanctions against Russia. McCain already is working on legislation with the leading Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin.", "If Trump's stance on Russia might fray some of his alliances in Congress, he's already put European allies on edge with his warmth toward Putin and questions about the worth of NATO. He's also unnerved Asian allies by questioning the cost of helping Japan and South Korea defend themselves. ", "\"I can see why it's a temptation for a big shot like Trump to think that smaller powers don't matter and you just solve your problems with the other big guys,\" said Sestanovich, who is also a professor at Columbia University. \"That's just a mistake. The other guys are going to eat your lunch if you have let American alliance ties wither. I think that's what he doesn't get.\" ", "He said that, \"The biggest lever we have with the Chinese is our network of alliances, similarly with the Russians.\"", "Some analysts have suggested Trump is practicing a sophisticated version of the \"triangular diplomacy\" former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and President Richard Nixon used to play the Soviet Union and China off against each other in the 1970s. ", "But the two nations are no longer bitter enemies and instead have a well-defined, if mutually wary, relationship.", "\"There's no way by improving relations with Russia you get a significant bang for your buck with the Chinese,\" Sestanovich said.", "China, like Russia, has targeted the US with cyberattacks. Beijing has pushed US companies in China to give up proprietary technology, it has contested US claims to freedom of navigation through Asian waters, its military has buzzed US naval vessels and Air Force jets, and it recently stole a US underwater drone. ", "If Trump seems to look the other way on Russian transgressions, China gets no free pass.", "The President-elect, who manufactures parts of his clothing line in China, often charges that Beijing steals American jobs with unfair trade practices. \"China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!\" he tweeted Monday. Soon after winning the presidency, he antagonized Beijing by holding a phone conversation with Taiwan's leader.", "Trump has long made China a bogeyman, accusing it in a 2012 tweet of having \"created\" the concept of global warming in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive. He has particularly fixated on China's economic practices, blasting it on trade and currency throughout the presidential race and blaming it for the loss of American jobs. Trade and job losses were central rallying cries of his campaign.", "RELATED: Donald Trump's fight with America's spies", "Richard Bush, director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, said Trump's criticisms reflect a lack of understanding about international economics. \"The jobs China is accused of stealing, many were lost a long time ago to Korea or Japan and moved from there to China,\" he said. \"A lot of that job loss occurred because of technology change,\" he said. ", "And despite Trump's promises to bring jobs back to the US, Bush said, \"Nobody in the US would do them at the wages companies would want to charge. Those jobs are never going to be gotten back.\"", "Bush also pointed out that there are limits to how much any US president can change relations with China. \"Will the American business community sit idly by and watch Trump undertake a trade war with China? They have a lot at stake in this,\" he said. ", "In the meantime, Trump's stream of anti-Chinese Tweets poses risks, he said.", "While Trump might be trying to create bargaining positions or exert pressure, his tweets might be misunderstood, Bush said, creating the chance that \"China would regard a potential challenge as more dangerous than it actually might be.\"", "This story has been updated."]},

", "Though its official founding was 1911, there was a professor named Miss Georgia M. Starr who in 1903 formed and directed a choral ensemble at Morehouse (which was then Atlanta Baptist College). It consisted of 10 to 12 students. Then in 1911 came Kemper Harreld. This Indiana native was a world-renowned violinist, who christened the music group the Morehouse College Glee Club. Under his direction, the glee club and the Morehouse College Glee Club Quartet performed at least three times for President Franklin D. Roosevelt.", "\"The glee club has always been about more than music,\" according to W. Floyd Ruffin, who graduated from Morehouse in 1954. The retired music educator, who was the last student accompanist under Harreld, added that Harreld was a perfectionist who insisted the young men talked, walked and performed in excellence.

More commonly known as \"Doc,\" Whalum served Morehouse College and the glee club until he passed away in 1987.", "\"Dr. Whalum gave, most of all, to the glee club an abiding love for coming together as brothers in song for the common good of offering music to the world,\" said Dr. Uzee Brown, a 1972 Morehouse graduate who currently is chairman of Morehouse's music department. Brown was also student director and accompanist under Whalum. ", "Under his leadership, the glee club performed for King's funeral. In March 1972, the glee club made a month-long tour of five African countries. The glee club sang for the inauguration of President Jimmy Carter in 1977 and in the East Room of the White House with Coretta Scott King in 1978. In spring 1987, the glee club recorded \"I'm Buildin' Me a Home,\" arranged by former glee club member Uzee Brown Jr., for the soundtrack of Spike Lee's movie \"School Daze.\" And one year shy of my arrival at \"The House,\" the glee club was featured on \"The Cosby Show\" accompanying Phylicia Rashad.", "Morrow's turn then came. He has been serving for almost 25 years. \"Like his predecessors, Dr. Morrow does not simply expect current glee clubbers to succeed in instrumental and vocal performance,\" said Jim Davis Jr., a 2004 graduate of Morehouse who is director of music ministry at Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York. \"He demands that each member succeeds educationally and professionally.\" ", "Under his leadership, the group participated in the 1996 Summer Olympics closing ceremonies and sang at Super Bowl XXVIII with Natalie Cole.

It seemed to be an issue of injustice,\" she said. ", "Yet when Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson entered the fray -- with their \"1960s approach to our social and political problems\" -- black and white America diverged, Swain said. ", "The Obama administration was all too happy to let it become a racial matter because \"Democrats see political gain in keeping blacks riled up,\" she said, questioning ", "the presence of voter registration booths", " at some of the rallies in honor of Martin. ", "The administration is \"fanning the flames of racism\" to galvanize the black electorate in hopes of a turnout similar to that in 2008, Swain said. Democrats are using Martin as a \"diversionary tactic\" to distract from the president's failings on unemployment, illegal immigration, HIV/AIDS education and the incidence of unwed mothers -- all of which Swain said have a disproportionate effect on black communities. ", "It's a delicate moment in American race relations, and the country needs a \"uniter in chief, and it's not coming from the president and it's not coming from the president's men,\" she said. ", "Standing alongside Sharpton -- as Holder did last week and Obama did last year -- ostracizes white people, Swain said, comparing Obama's 2011 National Action Network speech to a past president appearing alongside white nationalist David Duke. ", "Obama administration officials have appeared at National Action Network events in the past, and this year's convention hosted several Cabinet members besides Holder, including Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, who holds Cabinet rank.", "\"It's my understanding that Al Sharpton has had an open door to the White House. He's always had a legitimate status with President Obama, but not the rest of us,\" she said. \"When the attorney general stands with a character like that, it legitimizes them inappropriately.\"", "The trajectory of Sharpton's political career is not unlike that of civil rights activists before him, the reverend said. Jackson started out as a \"rabble-rouser\" before he became a two-time presidential candidate and presidential envoy under Bill Clinton, Sharpton said. Andrew Young was a key figure in the Rev. Martin Luther King's movement before adding the titles of U.S. congressman, U.N. ambassador and Atlanta mayor to his resume.", "\"(President) Jimmy Carter can appoint Andrew Young to a job, Bill Clinton can appoint Jesse Jackson to a job, and Al Sharpton can't meet with the president?\" he said. \"They worked for the administration. I don't work for the administration. I have access to it.\"", "Sharpton fighting \"dirty wars\"?", "Watkins disagrees with Swain's assertion that access to Obama makes Sharpton more legitimate, only because he believes Sharpton has become part of the establishment that is so often accused of keeping black people down.

It's Sharpton \"fighting their dirty wars,\" he said.", "Sharpton told \"60 Minutes\" last year that he is a \"refined agitator\" and ", "said he won't criticize Obama", " because \"to minimize who he is, I think, is an insult to the achievement of having him there.\"", "Simply put, Sharpton told CNN, he is a changed man and he has become more discerning. He also is \"a lot more hard on my staff about investigating and looking into things more deeply,\" and he's gotten better about picking and prioritizing his battles. ", "A good example was the rape case involving former International Monetary Fund managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, accused of sexually assaulting a Guinean hotel maid in New York ", "before prosecutors dropped the charges", ". ", "At the time, many asked why Sharpton didn't get involved. Though he sympathized with the alleged victim and advised her attorneys privately, he said he never stepped to the forefront because he didn't see how the case fit his group's social mission.

", "\"This cozy relationship between the Obama administration and Al Sharpton is one that minimizes his credibility as a civil rights leader,\" Watkins said. \"It cheapens his legacy.\"", "The criticism isn't fair, Sharpton contends, because he's done a good job balancing his roles.

", "Nor did it have any effect on him advocating for Martin, which he called the \"civil rights case of our time.\" Sharpton just does things differently than he used to in his younger, more fiery days, he said, again invoking those civil rights leaders who marched before him.", "\"I grew up under the generation ahead of me -- Andrew Young and Jesse -- who went through that same growth period,\" he said."]},

Spielberg, whose first film, \"Duel,\" was about a highway motorist being menaced by a mysterious tanker truck, was afraid of being typecast if he took the \"Jaws\" job. \"Who wants to be known as a shark-and-truck director?\" he complained.", "2. None of the three main actors -- Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss -- was the producers' first choice for the parts. Robert Duvall and Charlton Heston were among those considered for Chief Brody, while Lee Marvin and Sterling Hayden were initially sought for Captain Quint, and Jeff Bridges was discussed for Matt Hooper, the marine biologist.", "3. The movie's script eliminated several subplots from Peter Benchley's novel that Spielberg considered distracting, including an affair between Chief Brody's wife, Ellen, and Hooper (Dreyfuss).", "4. Location scouts considered filming locales across the United States but chose Martha's Vineyard because they needed a summer beach resort town with a sheltered bay, manageable tides and shallow waters to make filming easier.", "Defining moments in '70s television", "5. Although the movie is set in midsummer, producers began filming in early May 1974 to avoid an actors' strike that was scheduled to begin July 1. If you look closely in the background of some scenes, you can see trees with no leaves.", "6. The movie's 25-foot great white shark was played by three full-scale mechanical models towed by submerged \"sleds\" or guided by hidden scuba divers. The crew nicknamed the shark \"Bruce\" after Spielberg's lawyer, Bruce Ramer. ", "7. Spielberg, frustrated by the shark's frequent malfunctions, had another name for it: \"the great white turd.\"", "8. British actor Shaw was so concerned about owing taxes to the IRS on his income that he flew to Bermuda or Canada on almost all his days off to limit his work hours in the United States.", "9. The grieving mother who slapped Chief Brody in the movie was played by actress Lee Fierro. She had a difficult time faking the slap and instead walloped Scheider over and over during the many takes needed to get the scene right.", "10. At one point, Quint's boat, the Orca, sank unexpectedly during filming, soaking cameras and threatening to ruin the day's completed footage. The waterlogged film was flown to a lab in New York, where technicians were able to save it.", "11. When composer John Williams first played his ominous two-note \"shark theme\" score for Spielberg on a piano, the director thought it was a joke. Later Spielberg would say, \"The score was clearly responsible for half of the success of that movie.\"", "12. Local fishermen were unable to catch a big enough shark to use in the scene in which town officials prematurely celebrate a large shark that's been caught and strung up on a dock. So the film's producers located a freshly caught 13-foot tiger shark in Florida and flew it up to Massachusetts on a private plane. By the time the cameras rolled, however, the shark was decomposing and smelled awful.", "Quiz: Who were you in the '70s?", "13. The movie's protracted shoot was so troubled by mishaps that some crew members privately began calling the film \"Flaws.\"", "14. Brody's famous line upon first encountering the shark, \"We're gonna need a bigger boat,\" was ad-libbed by Scheider. At test screenings, the audience's screams drowned out the line, so Spielberg re-edited the scene to make it more audible.", "15. A young filmmaker named John Landis was visiting the set when he was pressed into duty to help build the rickety wooden pier used in the scene where two men try to catch the shark with a hook and chain, baited with a roast. Landis went on to direct \"Animal House\" and \"An American Werewolf in London.\"", "16. For the famous scene in which Quint recounts the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, Shaw persuaded Spielberg to let him have a few drinks before the cameras started rolling. But Shaw got so drunk, he had to be carried to the set and couldn't get through his lines. He later called Spielberg and apologized; they shot the scene again the next day, and Shaw nailed it.", "17. To add authenticity to the scene in which Hooper goes underwater in the shark cage, a second unit shot footage of real sharks in Australia. To make the sharks appear bigger, the filmmakers used a shrunken shark cage and a Hooper stunt double played by a 4-foot-9 ex-jockey in a wetsuit.", "18. The original script, like the novel, called for Hooper to be killed when the shark bites through the cage. But the Australia crew had captured spectacular footage of a great white attacking an empty shark cage, and Spielberg wanted to use it. So the scene was rewritten to let Hooper escape, sparing Dreyfuss' character.", "Could there be any scarier way to watch 'Jaws' than this?", "19. After principal filming wrapped, Spielberg decided he needed one more big scare. He wasn't satisfied with the scene in which Hooper investigates a fisherman's sunken boat and is jolted when the man's disembodied head floats out of the hull. So Spielberg recruited a small crew and reshot the scene in film editor Verna Fields' backyard swimming pool in Encino, California. To make the clear, chlorinated water match the murkier look of the ocean, crew members poured a gallon of milk into the pool.", "20. Test screenings revealed that the audience's loudest screams were for ", "the severed-head scene", " -- even louder than when the shark first rises out of the water behind Brody. After the movie opened, Spielberg and screenwriter Gottlieb would sneak into screenings in Los Angeles and stand in the back of the theater \"just to watch the sold-out audience visibly rise out of their seats with a collective shriek.\"", "21. John Williams conducted the orchestra during the 1976 Academy Awards, so when he won the Oscar for best score, he had to dash up to the podium to accept his Oscar and then run back down to continue conducting.", "Sources: \"", "The Jaws Log", ",\" by Carl Gottlieb; Ain't it Cool News; IMDb."]},

", "\"Every place we've looked on Earth, we've come up with life,\" Bell said. \"So it would be kind of surprising if we didn't find life there.\" ", "The earlier drillings stopped short of the lake, in part because scientists weren't confident about getting to the water without contaminating it. University of Hawaii oceanography professor David M. Karl said areas of those cores that were near the lake -- accreted ice, or ice derived from the lake itself -- contained a few viable bacteria that became active under incubation.", "\"There were a very few microorganisms, but in fact there were microorganisms,\" said Karl, who found them in a half-meter sample of the accreted ice in the late 1990s.", "He said that could mean viable microorganisms exist in the lake. It's also possible nothing is alive there, in part because no sunlight gets to the lake through ice that thick. But fossil microorganisms may be found, and microorganisms could be living off other sources of energy, such as geothermal, he said.", "\"There also could be living microorganism living off of previously stored energy from sediments,\" Karl said.", "Bell said that to reach the water, the Russians drilled to within about 10 meters (33 feet) of the bottom of the ice, then withdrew the drill bit and used a heat probe to bore the rest of the way. The effort was designed so that when the ice sheet was breached, lake water was drawn upward a short distance. ", "That water quickly froze, closing off the lake and allowing scientists to take samples without introducing any contaminants, Bell said. ", "\"The international community has tried to work collaboratively to try to make sure things are done as safely as possible, and it's in the Russians' interests to do it right,\" she said."]}
