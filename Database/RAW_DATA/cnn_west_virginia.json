The views expressed in this commentary are his own.", " (CNN)", "On its face -- and under less suspicious circumstances -- there would be nothing wrong with President Trump having an impromptu side meeting with Vladimir Putin. Such meetings are a staple of big, global confabs like the G-20. Indeed, it is often during these more intimate discussions that real progress on contentious issues can be made.", "But we can't afford to take anything regarding Russia at face value right now.  Putin's malevolence and the Trump administration's repeated failure to come clean about their interactions with Russian officials -- including this one -- raise legitimate questions about where this most critical of bilateral relationships is heading.", "So, yes, in that context, this hour-long pull-aside matters. And, yes, it warrants scrutiny. First of all, we learned about it through media reporting, specifically an interview by NPR's Audie Cornish of Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer. The White House only acknowledged it when pressed by reporters following up. ", "Unless they're simply brief, chance encounters, meetings of this nature -- and certainly one between the President of the United States and the President of Russia -- are typically summarized by government officials. This readout, as it is called, accomplishes two things: it serves as a public record of the President's participation in the conference, and provides a way to advance his message about whatever issues were discussed.", "That there was no overt acknowledgement of the meeting, let alone a readout, suggests either that the President's staff didn't know about it (troubling all by itself) or that the White House didn't want it known (more troubling, given ongoing investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election).  ", "Of course, the only way the White House could produce a readout would be to ask the President to write it, because there was no one else present from the US side.

One might think he wouldn't undertake a discussion with Vladimir Putin, even impromptu, without a strategy and without the backup and support of informed senior staff, who could help guide him through any minefields Putin might lay.", "And one should expect that Trump would not want to rely on a Russian government translator to make plain the points he was  trying to make. ", "There's a reason we employ our own translators. You can rest easy that they will accurately and scrupulously convey the meaning of every word you utter. Don't have one with you?  Go get one before you huddle with a foreign leader for anything more than a quick hello.

", "Mr. Trump isn't a private citizen anymore. He's not a CEO. He's the President.  That means he belongs to us, the American people.

", "In this case, only the Russians will have a record of it. It's hard to see how that serves us well. Because the record itself serves a greater purpose than just archival. It helps reinforce public trust and confidence in the institutions of government, in our very democracy. It reminds us that we are all Trump's employers.", "Sen.

", "The Sunday night shooting in Las Vegas that left 59 dead and hundreds more injured has restarted a debate over whether Congress should impose stricter gun laws, particularly around background checks for gun buyers and the sale of semi-automatic firearms. ", "But Democrats pushing for those laws have run into the same roadblocks that stymied former President Barack Obama in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2012: The National Rifle Association's overwhelming influence in Republican strongholds. ", "That power comes largely as a result of the extreme partisan makeup of most of the nation's congressional districts: The primary is a more serious threat to most incumbents than the general election. And in Republican primaries, the NRA's endorsement and advertising dollars carry huge weight. ", "\"It gives the NRA leadership an enormous outsized influence on these members,\" said Jason Kander, an Army National Guard veteran and the former Democratic Missouri secretary of state. \"They're more afraid of losing a primary than they are more people losing their lives.\" ", "A major underpinning of the polarization of American politics over the last two decades has been the disappearance of \"swing seats.\" The Cook Political Report's \"partisan voter index\" -- which measures how each congressional district performs at the congressional level compared to the nation as a whole -- scored 164 districts within five points of the average in 1997. But by this year, that number had dropped to 72 -- a 56% decline meaning that fewer than one-in-six House seats are naturally competitive. ", "District boundaries", "That's where another issue -- gerrymandering, the use of partisanship in drawing the boundaries of congressional and state legislative districts -- comes in. ", "The Supreme Court heard a Wisconsin case Tuesday that could lead to new rules that would result in more competitive congressional maps. ", "Such a ruling, gun control advocates hope, would spur lawmakers of both parties representing those districts to court voters in the center, rather than playing to partisan extremes. ", "Some forms of gun control are overwhelmingly popular. This spring, the Pew Research Center found that 83% said they consider gun violence in the US a big problem -- including 50% who called it \"a very big problem.\" Sixty-eight percent told Pew they favor a ban on assault-style weapons, while 64% favor banning high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Majorities also favor background checks for private and gun show sales. ", "The popularity of those measures doesn't matter, though, because majority Republicans in the House and Senate -- many from rural states where gun ownership and hunting is central to their culture and the NRA's membership is powerful -- are more threatened by competitive primaries, where the NRA's endorsement of a challenger who has opposed all forms of gun control would pose a grave threat. ", "\"This is one of the few issues where gerrymandering plays a large role,\" said Jon Soltz, the chairman of VoteVets, a progressive group that backs Democratic veterans in House and Senate races.", "Democrats' role", "The inability of Congress to pass stricter gun laws isn't just because of Republicans. ", "In 2013, five Democrats, including North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, sank a measure written by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, R-Pennyslvania, to expand background checks. ", "Since then, Democrats have watched as President Donald Trump has risen to power in part by relying on the Republican base -- emphasizing issues like curbing immigration, limiting LGBT rights and more that energize that base and keep the party's congressional leaders on board with his agenda, even when those issues are unpopular with the broader electorate. ", "If Trump was a Democrat, \"He would attack the NRA, because that's what people are afraid of, and he would tie them to something that's anti-American, like the Confederacy or Russia. And he would do it very aggressively with his own voice,\" Soltz said.", "Some Democrats have shed the caution with which they approached the 2013 gun control debate and are taking more aggressive stances. ", "Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said Congress should \"get off its ass.\" Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton refused to join Trump's moment of silence for Las Vegas victims, saying that \"it's time for action.\" ", "The Progressive Change Campaign Committee said this week it would send fundraising emails to its list of 1 million members on behalf of politicians who demand stricter gun laws. PCCC co-founder Adam Green said in an email to the group's supporters that the effort is to \"reward those brave political leaders who go beyond kind thoughts and prayers -- and who demand action on guns.\" ", "Republican response", "But Republicans resisted those calls. Kentucky Gov.

Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana.  ", "The other half hail from swing states that Trump won by a smaller margin and are less predictable. ", "Political observers will keep a close eye on this first group of senators and their actions on Capitol Hill. Will they support the President's agenda? Or will they side with Democrats in big votes? Will they act as deal-makers between the two parties?", "In the first 100 days of the Trump administration, several have made White House visits to sit down in a group setting with the President or attend bill signings. ", "Three of those Democrats \u2014 Manchin, Heitkamp and Donnelly -- went against their own party's filibuster of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and ultimately joined Republicans in the final confirmation vote. ", "This group of Democrats also had the fewest \"no\" votes on other major Trump nominees.

", "The senator met with Trump in December to discuss a potential spot as energy secretary, but soon after the meeting Manchin said he planned to stay in the Senate.

", "\"I have access, I can speak to him,\" he said. \"I don't think he looks at me from the standpoint, 'Well, you're the opposition party and you're the opposition.'\" ", "Manchin has voted against four of Trump's Cabinet or major administration nominees -- casting the fewest \"no\" votes among Democrats -- and was the only one in his party to vote in favor of confirming Jeff Sessions for attorney general.  ", "Manchin also worked behind the scenes with a bipartisan group of senators to urge both parties to find a deal to ", "avert the \"nuclear option\" in the battle over Gorsuch. ", "The talks were unsuccessful, but Manchin was vocal in his disappointment with both sides. He was one of three Democrats who ultimately voted to confirm Gorsuch. ", "In an unusual move, the senator has also been getting to know conservative media outlets, including Breitbart. ", "Manchin, who's in his first full term as a senator, faces a tough re-election battle in West Virginia next year, where Republicans feel confident they can pick up a Senate seat, given the state's support for Trump last year. Unlike other Democrats, who've benefited from grassroots enthusiasm, Manchin only raised about $550,000 in the first quarter. ", "Still, a Democrat, Jim Justice, was elected governor of West Virginia on the same ballot as Trump, showing the state's not-so-predictable voting behavior. ", "Rep. Evan Jenkins is considering a run for the Republican nomination to challenge Manchin, as is state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. ", "But Manchin, who's also served as governor of West Virginia, is a well-known figure in the state, and he's relying on his brand as a bipartisan broker to carry him to a second term. ", "Heidi Heitkamp, D -- North Dakota ", "Heitkamp was first elected in 2012 and raked in $1.6 million this quarter, finishing out the first three months of the year with $2 million in cash on hand.", "Like Manchin, she also comes from a state where Trump crushed Hillary Clinton last year, by 36 points. ", "Heitkamp was another Democrat who voted to confirm Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and she voted against five of Trump's nominees. ", "She also met with Trump during the transition about a potential Cabinet post and went to the White House with other senators for a lunch in February and separately for two bill signings. ", "Rep. Kevin Cramer, North Dakota's at-large representative, is thinking about challenging Heitkamp next year. But ", "CNN's Manu Raju reported earlier this month that Senate GOP officials have grown concerned", " that Cramer's penchant for controversial remarks could damage the party's chances.

Her focus remains on winning this race, which she is in a great position to do, and then helping President Trump advance an America First agenda,\" Ward press secretary Zachery Henry said. ", "Trump hammered Bannon in a remarkable four-paragraph statement after adapted excerpts of a forthcoming book in which Bannon described a Trump Tower meeting between Trump's son and a group of Russians as \"treasonous\" and \"unpatriotic\" were released. The Wall Street Journal later reported that in another section of the book, Bannon is quoted describing Ivanka Trump as ", "\"dumb as a brick.\"", " ", "A spokeswoman for West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the Bannon-backed candidate who faces Rep. Evan Jenkins in the primary before a match-up with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, criticized Bannon's remarks about Trump's family. ", "\"Patrick Morrisey has been endorsed by many conservatives throughout West Virginia and America because of his strong conservative record. Attorney General Morrisey does not support these attacks on President Trump and his family, and was proud to stand with President Trump in 2016 when they were both overwhelmingly elected in West Virginia and when he cast his vote for Trump in the Electoral College,\" Morrisey spokeswoman Nachama Soloveichik said. ", "Her comment came an hour after Jenkins said in a statement that Morrisey \"should immediately disavow Bannon's support.\" ", "Michael Grimm, a House candidate from New York who months ago heaped praise on Bannon, also sharply criticized the Breitbart executive. ", "\"I strongly denounce the comments by Steve Bannon as quoted by Michael Wolff. They are baseless attacks against the President's family, beyond disturbing, and I fully support our Commander in Chief,\" Grimm said in a statement.", "Others offered at least tepid support for Bannon.", "In Nevada, Sen.

", "The former chief strategist in President Donald Trump's White House spent the weekend in Connecticut meeting with top Republican donors, a source familiar with Bannon's plans said, as he recruits financial support for enough candidates to nationalize an anti-establishment message in 2018 GOP primaries.", "He's held similar meetings in New York City and Washington, speaking with more than 25 major GOP donors so far, including hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, energy executive Dan Eberhart, private equity firm CEO John Childs and mega-donors Robert and Rebekah Mercer.  ", "It was a continuation of what he's done every day since September 26, when the Bannon-backed former judge Roy Moore ousted Sen. Luther Strange in an Alabama Republican primary: Hold meetings to recruit candidates and form a donor network to back them. ", "Bannon's raison d'etre is to take on McConnell and nationalize Republicans behind Trump.", "His thinking -- evidenced by the Senate's failure to advance Trump agenda items like health care -- is that Washington Republicans do not support Trump anyway. So 2018 could be a defining moment, shaking up the GOP and placing Trump's 2016 campaign agenda at its forefront. ", "What Bannon is seeking from prospective candidates, the source said, is one simple pledge: That they won't vote for McConnell as Senate majority leader. ", "Bannon's recruiting efforts have intensified over the last two weeks. He is now looking for candidates who can replicate Sen. Mike Lee's stunning ouster of former Sen. Robert Bennett at Utah's 2010 Republican convention next year against Sen. Orrin Hatch. And he is in contact with allies in Nebraska seeking a candidate to take on Sen. Deb Fischer. ", "And that's \"just a partial list,\" the source familiar with Bannon's plans said. ", "\"Nobody's safe,\" the source said.", "Already, he had spoken with Erik Prince, the Blackwater security contractor, and GOP mega-donor Foster Friess about running against Republican Sen. John Barrasso in Wyoming. ", "Bannon has also backed Kelli Ward's effort to oust Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. He hosted Danny Tarkanian in Washington to discuss his campaign against Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada. And he met recently with Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel about taking on Sen. Roger Wicker.", "McDaniel, who said he is strongly considering running against Wicker, said Monday that he and Bannon have been in regular contact since 2014, when McDaniel came close to unseating Sen. Thad Cochran. Support from Bannon is helpful, McDaniel said, with strong Trump supporters who know Bannon was a leading figure on the President's campaign and with those who read Breitbart.com, where Bannon is a top executive. ", "\"You factor in the big news he made in 2016,\" McDaniel said. \"You factor in his drive, his work ethic -- and people sense a winner and understand he can bring resources to bear, whether it's Breitbart or with financial resources.\"", "Bannon also plans to get involved in the primaries in West Virginia and Missouri, two of Republicans' top opportunities to pick off Democratic-held seats next year.", "The plan, the source said, is for these Bannonites to nationalize their 2018 message with a consolidated, consistent argument across the map. ", "Bannon wants that message to be about \"big things\" -- that the grassroots Republican voters are in control and that they don't need the establishment's money or what he views as its corruption. ", "Avoiding another O'Donnell", "Bannon, the source said, believes his insurgent slate will be different than the tea party calamity of 2010, when flawed candidates like Christine O'Donnell in Delaware and Sharron Angle in Nevada cost the party seats, or 2012, when Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana made controversial remarks that swung their races in Democrats' favor. ", "Instead, Bannon, the source said, is recruiting candidates who are focused on substance -- particularly immigration and trade -- and could win over a loose coalition of social conservatives, tea party activists and values voters. ", "The test case was Alabama, where Moore -- a controversial figure who was twice ousted as state Supreme Court chief justice, first for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument and later for refusing to recognize the US Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage -- defeated Strange, who benefited from $10 million in advertising from the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC. ", "In Alabama, Bannon broke with Trump, who had gone to Huntsville for a campaign rally for Strange just days before the election. ", "But the two are still in frequent contact. Bannon spoke to Trump in recent days, the source said, arguing that from Trump's perspective the Senate is already lost because the President understands he has little support there. ", "As if to underscore that view, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker -- the Senate foreign relations committee chairman who is retiring rather than running for re-election in 2018 -- accused Trump ", "in a New York Times interview ", "of putting the nation on a path to World War III and said Trump's presidency \"would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.\"", "It was Corker who had urged Trump in a White House meeting to go to Alabama and campaign for Strange -- a decision the President came to regret -- according to a source who spoke to the President.", "Bannon, meanwhile, has argued he is taking on Republicans who don't support Trump's policies. ", "Where's money coming from?", "One source of financial support for Bannon-backed candidates is the Great America PAC, a super PAC led by former Ronald Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. ", "The group plans to roll out an initial set of three endorsements of Republican candidates this week.   ", "It isn't expected to be as aggressive in seeking to unseat Republican incumbents as Bannon has been, but the super PAC does intend to support Senate candidates who back Trump's agenda and call for the elimination of the Senate's 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster -- potentially including Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel, Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale, West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey and more. ", "It could also support candidates who could weaken Democratic senators seen as potential 2020 Trump opponents, including Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts. ", "\"The reality here is, you have to tap into that Trump agenda intensity. And those are the candidates who can win in the general election,\" said Eric Beach, the Great America PAC co-chair. ", "Bannon, meanwhile, is focused on damaging people who might be considering 2020 in both parties -- including Mitt Romney, who could run for the Senate in Utah if Hatch retires. ", "The key, the source familiar with Bannon's plans said, \"is to prove the theory of the case\" -- that Republicans who are anti-Trump should be gone."]},

Though particulars are hard to come by, Democrats, with Trump's campaign pledges in mind, were quick off the blocks in denouncing it. ", "Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez warned that any Republican plan would \"overwhelmingly benefit the super rich and corporations over hardworking Americans.\" It's a simple argument and one the party seems poised to rally behind.", "\"The message war is going to be: Who actually gets the money?\" Wikler said. \"Trump makes this simple because he is a billionaire, his Cabinet is full of billionaires. People get who he's looking out for.\" ", "Health care, though, is a much more visceral issue, and social welfare programs are famously difficult to roll back. Tax cuts are an easier sell. Democratic lawmakers kept a firm line in the health care fight. But with tough 2018 races ahead, especially for endangered Senate Democrats (more on them soon), defections are a concern. ", "The plan, as Wikler explains it, is to connect the dots -- back to health care. ", "\"The way we see it is that this spring, Republicans tried to take away people's health care to pay for a massive tax cut for the wealthy. And they failed. Now they're trying to, one step at a time, start with a massive tax cut for the wealthy, and then take away our health care,\" he said.

Inside the Beltway and in activist circles, the policy prescriptions were greeted optimistically. But Trump's grip on the national political narrative was never in doubt. ", "So how do Democrats break through?", "Nick Rathod, executive director of the State Innovation Exchange and an Obama White House veteran, pointed to the \"Fight for $15,\" a union-backed grass-roots push to raise the minimum wage, as an example of how the party can pick up steam despite its deficit in Washington.", "\"Congress is in perpetual gridlock, Trump is doing whatever, and while I don't recommend taking your eye off the ball federally, where you can actually make change and actually make a difference is at the local level,\" he said. \"That's where I think people should be organizing and working.\"", "The Service Employees International Union and the \"Fight for $15,\" which it helped launch, tapped Sanders to be the face of a new campaign, begun on Labor Day, to push back against Republican efforts to gut organized labor in the Midwest and Rust Belt.

In this world, Berniecrats are at war with the Democratic establishment for the soul of the party.
