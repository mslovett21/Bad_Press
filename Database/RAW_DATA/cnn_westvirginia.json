Joe Manchin's head.", "\"Get Monte from 'Say Yes to the Dress.' You know Monte -- what's his last name?\" the Democratic senator spun around smiling, looking at everyone nearby. \"He's a West Virginia boy!\"", "Manchin was touring a job fair hosted by his office last week and had just met the director of West Virginia's affiliate for Dress for Success, an organization that helps provide professional clothes for women.", "As he'd been doing with others at the fair, the Democratic senator tried to think of someone who could help publicize their cause.", "\"He's on 'Say Yes to the Dress,'\" Manchin repeated, still searching for the last name of the celebrity bridal consultant from the TLC reality show. Minutes later, a staffer looking at a phone answered him.", "\"Durham,\" she said. \"Monte's last name is Durham.\"", "It was the 17th job fair Manchin's office had hosted, this time in Huntington, West Virginia, a city with nearly 50,000 people on the western edge of the state. A steady stream of hundreds flowed in and out of a small arena for more than three hours to circulate among the 160 vendors.", "When Manchin, who's known for his retail politicking skills, showed up, he could barely make his way through the lobby. He wasn't swarmed like a celebrity; rather, there was an air of familiarity. ", "People walked up to him to take selfies or say he was doing a good job. Others approached him with personal requests, asking for help in Washington or support for local projects. Some politely shook his hand but showed no interest in talking to him.", "On Manchin's part, there was a lot of affection: squeezing of elderly women's hands, shoulder slapping with men and hearty handshakes and hugs. He constantly tried to come up with ideas to help the people he encountered, from recovering drug addicts to veterans.", "Manchin was already a well-known figure in West Virginia and on the national stage, but he has seen renewed attention under the first 100 days of President Donald Trump's administration.", "That's because his status as one of the few Democrats up for re-election in a state that overwhelmingly voted for Trump has thrust him into a delicate position, where he can be both courted and criticized by both sides of the aisle.", "But make no mistake: Manchin is no shoe-in for his re-election next year.", "Though the senator -- who's had a long career in public service -- has high name recognition in the state and a brand as a centrist Democrat, he's still campaigning among an electorate that picked Trump over Hillary Clinton by a whopping 42 points.", "At the fair, a Cowboy-hat wearing Democrat named Charles Masters approached him with a photo of a younger Manchin standing next to a younger Bill Clinton, the last Democratic presidential candidate to win the Mountain State back in 1996.", "\"He is standing beside the greatest politician that ever lived,\" Masters later told CNN, talking about the photo and praising Clinton's ability to work with Republicans.", "It was a stark illustration of the complex situation Manchin now finds himself in. He's a Democrat who started his political career in a state that was once very comfortable with Democrats but now rejects some of the progressive trajectory the party has taken.  ", "In fact, ", "Democrats in West Virginia outnumbered Republicans in last year's election -- 44% to 31%", " -- but the state still yielded Trump one of his greatest victory margins over Clinton.", "Manchin said people have pitched him the idea of abandoning his identity as a Democrat and adopting a different political affiliation. But he said he's \"just not going to do it.\"", "\"People pretty much know my brand. They know who I am,\" he told CNN in an interview, while munching on a chicken salad sandwich after the fair.", "\"If I was a constituent and I looked at me and I said 'Joe Manchin, he's changed to a Republican or changed to an independent. What was his purpose -- strictly to get re-elected? To help him politically? Or did he change his brand, too? Is he going to be somebody different now? Maybe he's not going to be the old Joe I've known for 30 years.' So I said, listen, I am who I am. Being a 'D' or an 'R' or not does not change anything.\"", "Aiming to be the 'honest broker'", "Instead, Manchin is building a case that he's a Democrat with Trump's ear and can be what he calls an \"honest broker\" between the White House and his own party.", "\"I have access, I can speak to him,\" he said. \"I don't think he looks at me from the standpoint, 'Well you're the opposition party and you're the opposition.'\"", "Manchin said their rapport far surpasses his relationship with former President Barack Obama, of which he said \"there was none.\"", "Trump invited Manchin to Trump Tower in December to discuss a potential job as energy secretary. Not long after, Manchin announced ", "he'd be staying in the Senate", ". Still, he has visited the White House multiple times this year and speaks openly about conversing with Trump over the phone.", "Manchin has voted against only four of Trump's cabinet or major administration nominees -- casting the fewest \"no\" votes among Democrats -- and was the only one in his party to confirm Jeff Sessions for attorney general. ", "He also worked behind the scenes with a bipartisan group of senators in search ", "of a deal to avert the \"nuclear option\" ", "in the battle over Neil Gorsuch, Trump's pick for the Supreme Court. The talks were unsuccessful, and Manchin was vocal in his disappointment with both parties. He was one of three Democrats who ultimately went against their party's filibuster and voted to confirm Gorsuch.", "Manchin's relationship with the President -- as well as the senator's efforts to cozy up to conservative media outlets like Breitbart -- have generated buzz this year, and last week Manchin sounded open to a potential endorsement from Trump, though he said he hasn't spoken with the president about it.", "\"We'll just see,\" he said. \"We'll see if the political winds pull him in that direction.\"", "Manchin has also been critical of Trump at times. He opposed the President's initial executive order on immigration back in February and has sent sharp warnings against trying to repeal Obamacare, saying government should simply focus on repairing it.", "Still, in his interview with CNN, Manchin offered perhaps his highest compliment to Trump.", "\"President Trump, from all I can observe in the first 100 days, is operating like the governor of the United States,\" said Manchin, a former governor himself.", "Manchin still relishes his time as his state's chief executive (2005-2010) and almost achingly longs for that kind of role again. He's part of a former governors caucus in the Senate, where there's a running joke that the worst day as a governor is still better than the best day as a senator.", "\"We're the ones I think that can solve the problems. I really believe that. Because we had to,\" he said. \"We could never afford the luxury of being real right or real left.\"", "'That will be a hard decision'", "Not being \"real right or real left\" can also be a fitting description for West Virginia voters. ", "Interviews with more than a dozen local residents in search of a job at the fair revealed not only mixed reviews of Manchin but a mosaic of perspectives that defy political norms.", "Some were Democrats who voted for Trump. Some were Republicans who liked Manchin. But most emphasized that, while they may be registered with a party, they primarily consider themselves independents. ", "Most shared a widespread distrust of politicians, even for the ones they like. Mike Mitchell, 66, a registered Democrat who votes \"for the person, not the party,\" wanted Clinton to win, but he backed Trump instead. And while he said he's \"happy\" with Manchin as his senator and plans to vote for him next year, he said at the end of the day he's \"not sure\" he can trust him.", "\"Government is awful. It's just very awful,\" Mitchell said. \"Do you trust in who you believe in? It's very hard anymore. Things are not like they used to be. Even around here.\"", "Jarrett Peters, 78, said he's not registered with any party and voted for Trump last year. He said he likes the way things are going in Washington under the new administration and plans to vote for Manchin.", "Eddie Edwards, another Democrat who voted for Trump, wasn't as pleased with the federal government, including Manchin. \"I guess he's our guy. I don't pay attention to politics because it pisses me off,\" Edwards said, expressing frustration at the lack of jobs in the area and federal attempts to roll back Obamacare.", "Marilyn Meade, a 63-year-old Democrat who also stressed that she votes \"for the person,\" preferred Bernie Sanders over Clinton in the primary, but said she likes Manchin's moderate spirit and stated that she'll be voting for him next year.", "To further demonstrate her independent approach, Meade added that she voted for her Republican congressman, Evan Jenkins. ", "It's that same congressman who's considering a challenge against Manchin next year, as is state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.", "Meade was surprised to hear that Jenkins might run for the Senate, and her enthusiastic tone for Manchin suddenly changed.", "\"I don't know, that will be a hard decision,\" she said. ", "The forming opposition ", "Republicans, who feel they have a strong path to victory in West Virginia, are prepared to throw the kitchen sink at Manchin next year.", "The National Republican Senatorial Committee has already started linking his voting record -- and that of other vulnerable Democrats up for re-election -- to that of liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren and pointed out last week that her political action committee donated to his campaign.", "It's all part of an effort by Republicans to deflect attempts by these moderate Democrats to broaden their appeal among Trump voters. ", "\"Joe Manchin will speak conservative, but his actual voting record indicates otherwise,\" argued Conrad Lucas, chairman of the West Virginia GOP. ", "Also likely to come up is Manchin's 2013 proposal with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey to expand background checks on gun purchases, a position that drew sharp rebuke from gun rights activists, including the National Rifle Association. ", "Manchin, a gun owner himself, defended his compromise push four years ago, which failed to advance in the Senate. Manchin feels that the proposal now ", "has a greater chance of success under Trump than under Obama", ", because Second Amendment supporters won't be as worried that Trump will use it as a slippery slope toward more gun control. ", "\"There's no one who believes he's going to take their guns away,\" he said.", "Also anticipated from his opposition are attacks involving his daughter, Heather Bresch, ", "over criticism that her company, Mylan, raised prices for the life-saving medicine EpiPen by nearly 500% last year in order to enrich her company", "And Republicans are sure to reiterate Manchin's loyalty to Clinton last year, even after she made the damaging comment in a CNN town hall that she was \"going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"", "Clinton later said it was a misstatement, but the quote still reverberated around the state. She won a dismal 27% of the vote there in November.", "Manchin described her comment as \"horrible\" but defended his continued support of her after the remark, saying, \"I don't think that was in her heart. I talked to her and we were going to do things for my state.\"", "\"I think the President respects and understands the loyalty that I had. I wasn't against, I was just for,\" he said. \"And that person I was for got defeated.\"", "'I'm just going to get a boat'", "It's no secret that when Manchin is in Washington, he lives on a houseboat that he named \"Almost Heaven.\" It was both a practical and symbolic decision.", "\"I didn't want to be a permanent resident in Washington. And when you buy something, it's almost like you've anchored yourself down,\" he said. \"So I told my wife, I'm just going to get a boat.\"", "Multiple stories have been written about Manchin using his boat as a vessel to bring senators together behind the scenes, aided by some food and drinks.", "He said last week that sometimes they play music by country singer Lee Greenwood, most known for his song \"God Bless the USA,\" which Trump used as his walk-on music for campaign rallies.", "Manchin painted a hard-to-imagine picture of kumbaya moments on the boat.", "\"It's the most fulfilling thing to watch -- all these senators at the end of an evening, when we're together, hug each other and basically sing 'Proud to be an American,'\" he said.", "Manchin ranked No. 4 on a ", "bipartisan index by The Lugar Center and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy", ", which ranks senators based on how many pieces of legislation they worked on with members of the opposite party. ", "The only Democrat who had a higher ranking was Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who's also up for re-election next year in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. (The rankings measured legislative work from the 114th Congress, not the current session which started in January.)", "But acting as a bipartisan mediator can be a risky calculation during such partisan times. While it can appeal to more moderate voters, it can also remove the security blanket of getting the full support from your own party, and it can draw accusations of being a fair-weather politician based on the changing moods among voters.", "Manchin, as he approaches what's expected to be a tough race, appears to be comfortably set in what can sometimes look like political no-man's land. ", "\"The country is getting further and further apart. You know, you're on the right or the left. There's no middle,\" he said. \"And I'm not leaving the middle.\""]},

", "Now, in the same mountainous county along the Kentucky state line where blood was spilled and lives were lost in the famed feud nearly a century ago, two new sides are squaring off over serious allegations of repeated sexual assault on two schoolgirls by two male classmates. And there are claims of sham investigations and \"punishment\" that in one case allegedly amounted to  denying the accused an ice-cream break.", "The case moved behind closed doors Friday at the Mingo County courthouse, where two school district officials and four faculty members made their first appearance in a courtroom for a hearing a week after the state's top lawyer accused them in a civil complaint of concealing alleged sexual abuse at a Mingo County middle school. ", "West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a request for a civil injunction last week in which he alleges that two female students were victims of sexual assaults over the course of the year at the hands of two seventh-grade boys. According to the filing, abuse of the two 13-year-old Burch Middle School students, also in the seventh grade, took place on multiple occasions between November 2012 and May 2013. ", "The attorney general says in the filing that two boys would work in concert: one would restrain their victim while the other groped her \"breasts, genitalia (and) buttocks.\"  ", "Most of the alleged attacks Morrisey outlines in the filing took place at the school, except for a class trip to the state capital of Charleston, where one of the girls said she was raped.", "Names of neither the boys nor the girls have been released, but the attorney general's court filing identifies the suspects as Juvenile 1 and Juvenile 2, and states they are both relatives of employees of the Mingo County school system.", "Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney Teresa Maynard told CNN that she first learned of the investigation last week after Morrisey filed the request for an injunction. She said she met with the attorney general on Friday and explained to him that her office must be part of the investigation from now on -- and it didn't take her very long to show that she meant it: Maynard filed juvenile charges against both of the boys on Friday.  She would not divulge what those charges were.", "Maynard has not brought charges against any other parties, but the attorney general did name a handful of teachers and administrators as defendants in the court filing requesting a civil injunction", " ", "-- which is not to be confused with the filing of criminal charges. ", "Attorney General Morrisey declined to be interviewed for this article, but West Virginia State Police Public Information Officer Lt. Mike Baylous explained that a civil injunction -- like the one requested by Morrisey in this case -- is an \"extreme\" court order that is made for the purpose of restraining the defendant -- or in this case, the defendants - from pursuing any conduct that amounts to harassment. ", "The attorney general made the case in his complaint that he has ample reason to believe that a state investigation would be stymied.  As abhorrent as the allegations are themselves, Morrissey says they are not why he is taking this action; he's doing that because, he said", " ", "\"the overall handling of the allegations was inherently flawed and tainted with conflicts of interest.\" ", "That may seem like an understatement in a 32-page complaint that details allegations of disappearing evidence, connected suspects, sham investigations, deceitful and vengeful administrators, and refusals to cooperate with law enforcement. ", "Mingo County, going back to the Hatfield-McCoy days, has earned an unsavory reputation, thanks to nepotism, cronyism and a spectacular history of vendettas and public corruption.", "In the last few years Mingo's sheriff was assassinated, its only circuit judge and prosecutor both went to prison on conspiracy charges in an unrelated case, and a county commissioner pleaded guilty to extortion. Just this week, the mayor of the county's largest city pleaded guilty to lying to federal authorities in a workers' compensation case", ". ", "Not even the Mingo school system seems to be immune from controversy.  Court filings cite repeated examples of school officials allegedly protecting the accused in the seventh-grade sexual assault allegations, and claim that \"a relative of (one of the boys) was directly involved in the handling and investigation into the allegations against (him), and involved in decisions relating to the discipline/punishment of the male juvenile offenders.\" ", "That investigation, according to Morrisey's injunction request, was \"ineffective, non-existent, (and) designed (to) illicit contradictory and/or less incriminating statements from the female victims.\"", "When punishment was doled out, the attorney general characterized it as a mockery. In one instance, for example, a school official \"'disciplined' (the boys) for the alleged abuse of a female student by denying them a break for ice cream during statewide testing,\" the attorney general's court filing said.", "The attorney general says the problems go beyond alleged efforts to sweep the accusations under the carpet. Morrisey's complaint said Burch Middle School teachers and administrators \"threatened (the girls) with discipline\" to dissuade them from coming forward, and the alleged victims", " ", "were retaliated against when they did. ", "The day after one of the alleged victims alerted state police in April 2014, she was written up for bullying. Morrisey wrote that the \"bullying\" was actually the victim blocking her Facebook account from the niece of a teacher at the school.  The next day she was written up again, this time for \"insubordination,\" according to the filing.  ", "The attorney general alleges that the other victim says she was targeted as well: the injunction request states that a high-ranking Burch official \"retaliated against (her) by removing her from her classes and placing her in other classes that were below her academic level.\" ", "When West Virginia State Police showed up at Burch on April 24, the principal refused to allow a trooper", " ", "to take a statement from a possible third victim, according to the court filing. The principal \"went an additional step further and informed the State Trooper investigating the alleged sexual abuse at the school that he could no longer take statements from students at Burch Middle School because it 'disrupted the learning environment.'\" ", "CNN tried repeatedly to reach the teachers and administrators at Burch Middle School named in the filing for comment on the allegations, but multiple e-mails and phone messages were never returned.", "Jason Long, the attorney representing the Mingo County Board of Education and the Mingo County school superintendent, released a statement that said \"the Mingo County Board of Education is committed to working with the attorney general's office to resolve this investigation in a timely manner. The hearing today gathered everyone involved and opened a dialogue. We take these allegations very seriously.

Nick Rahall. Jenkins was re-elected in 2016.

", "The former chief strategist in President Donald Trump's White House spent the weekend in Connecticut meeting with top Republican donors, a source familiar with Bannon's plans said, as he recruits financial support for enough candidates to nationalize an anti-establishment message in 2018 GOP primaries.", "He's held similar meetings in New York City and Washington, speaking with more than 25 major GOP donors so far, including hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, energy executive Dan Eberhart, private equity firm CEO John Childs and mega-donors Robert and Rebekah Mercer.  ", "It was a continuation of what he's done every day since September 26, when the Bannon-backed former judge Roy Moore ousted Sen. Luther Strange in an Alabama Republican primary: Hold meetings to recruit candidates and form a donor network to back them. ", "Bannon's raison d'etre is to take on McConnell and nationalize Republicans behind Trump.", "His thinking -- evidenced by the Senate's failure to advance Trump agenda items like health care -- is that Washington Republicans do not support Trump anyway. So 2018 could be a defining moment, shaking up the GOP and placing Trump's 2016 campaign agenda at its forefront. ", "What Bannon is seeking from prospective candidates, the source said, is one simple pledge: That they won't vote for McConnell as Senate majority leader. ", "Bannon's recruiting efforts have intensified over the last two weeks. He is now looking for candidates who can replicate Sen. Mike Lee's stunning ouster of former Sen. Robert Bennett at Utah's 2010 Republican convention next year against Sen. Orrin Hatch. And he is in contact with allies in Nebraska seeking a candidate to take on Sen. Deb Fischer. ", "And that's \"just a partial list,\" the source familiar with Bannon's plans said. ", "\"Nobody's safe,\" the source said.", "Already, he had spoken with Erik Prince, the Blackwater security contractor, and GOP mega-donor Foster Friess about running against Republican Sen. John Barrasso in Wyoming. ", "Bannon has also backed Kelli Ward's effort to oust Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. He hosted Danny Tarkanian in Washington to discuss his campaign against Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada. And he met recently with Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel about taking on Sen. Roger Wicker.", "McDaniel, who said he is strongly considering running against Wicker, said Monday that he and Bannon have been in regular contact since 2014, when McDaniel came close to unseating Sen. Thad Cochran. Support from Bannon is helpful, McDaniel said, with strong Trump supporters who know Bannon was a leading figure on the President's campaign and with those who read Breitbart.com, where Bannon is a top executive. ", "\"You factor in the big news he made in 2016,\" McDaniel said. \"You factor in his drive, his work ethic -- and people sense a winner and understand he can bring resources to bear, whether it's Breitbart or with financial resources.\"", "Bannon also plans to get involved in the primaries in West Virginia and Missouri, two of Republicans' top opportunities to pick off Democratic-held seats next year.", "The plan, the source said, is for these Bannonites to nationalize their 2018 message with a consolidated, consistent argument across the map. ", "Bannon wants that message to be about \"big things\" -- that the grassroots Republican voters are in control and that they don't need the establishment's money or what he views as its corruption. ", "Avoiding another O'Donnell", "Bannon, the source said, believes his insurgent slate will be different than the tea party calamity of 2010, when flawed candidates like Christine O'Donnell in Delaware and Sharron Angle in Nevada cost the party seats, or 2012, when Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana made controversial remarks that swung their races in Democrats' favor. ", "Instead, Bannon, the source said, is recruiting candidates who are focused on substance -- particularly immigration and trade -- and could win over a loose coalition of social conservatives, tea party activists and values voters. ", "The test case was Alabama, where Moore -- a controversial figure who was twice ousted as state Supreme Court chief justice, first for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument and later for refusing to recognize the US Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage -- defeated Strange, who benefited from $10 million in advertising from the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC. ", "In Alabama, Bannon broke with Trump, who had gone to Huntsville for a campaign rally for Strange just days before the election. ", "But the two are still in frequent contact. Bannon spoke to Trump in recent days, the source said, arguing that from Trump's perspective the Senate is already lost because the President understands he has little support there. ", "As if to underscore that view, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker -- the Senate foreign relations committee chairman who is retiring rather than running for re-election in 2018 -- accused Trump ", "in a New York Times interview ", "of putting the nation on a path to World War III and said Trump's presidency \"would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.\"", "It was Corker who had urged Trump in a White House meeting to go to Alabama and campaign for Strange -- a decision the President came to regret -- according to a source who spoke to the President.", "Bannon, meanwhile, has argued he is taking on Republicans who don't support Trump's policies. ", "Where's money coming from?", "One source of financial support for Bannon-backed candidates is the Great America PAC, a super PAC led by former Ronald Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. ", "The group plans to roll out an initial set of three endorsements of Republican candidates this week.   ", "It isn't expected to be as aggressive in seeking to unseat Republican incumbents as Bannon has been, but the super PAC does intend to support Senate candidates who back Trump's agenda and call for the elimination of the Senate's 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster -- potentially including Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel, Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale, West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey and more. ", "It could also support candidates who could weaken Democratic senators seen as potential 2020 Trump opponents, including Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts. ", "\"The reality here is, you have to tap into that Trump agenda intensity. And those are the candidates who can win in the general election,\" said Eric Beach, the Great America PAC co-chair. ", "Bannon, meanwhile, is focused on damaging people who might be considering 2020 in both parties -- including Mitt Romney, who could run for the Senate in Utah if Hatch retires. ", "The key, the source familiar with Bannon's plans said, \"is to prove the theory of the case\" -- that Republicans who are anti-Trump should be gone."]}
