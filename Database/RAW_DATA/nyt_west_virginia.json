That was before the gentling hand of Dominique de Menil took hold.", "Mrs. de Menil, who died last December at 89, used her large fortune, which came from oil-well technology, to advance the cause of the arts in Houston. Her monuments are a series of buildings in the modestly bohemian section of town called Montrose -- the Rothko Chapel, a nondenominational building housing 14 somber canvases by Mark Rothko, with a Barnett Newman sculpture called ''Broken Obelisk'' nearby; the Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum, one block to the south, built to house a series of 13th-century wall paintings from a votive chapel in Cyprus, and the Menil Collection, a private museum on the scale of the Frick Collection in New York and the Wallace Collection in London.", "The Menil Collection is housed in one of the best museum buildings erected since World War II -- a gray clapboard structure, low-built like the neighborhood surrounding it, with noise-absorbing wooden floors and a clever system of S-shaped light baffles. It is the work of Renzo Piano, co-architect of the Pompidou Center in Paris. Mrs. de Menil (pronounced men-EEL) had a famous eye, and the museum's rooms are filled with stunning objects, ranging from a sixth-century Coptic funeral stele depicting a wide-eyed woman, to exquisite Chi-Wara antelope sculptures from Mali in West Africa, to icons from Novgorod and Venice and Turkey, to 20th-century Surrealist paintings. There is not a clunker in sight.", "All seems serene, but Texas is a land of surprises. The museum is currently playing host (along with the Museum of Fine Arts and the Contemporary Arts Museum) to the Robert Rauschenberg retrospective first shown at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. No sooner had it opened, with the 72-year-old artist, a native of nearby Port Arthur, in attendance, than constables swooped in and hauled away 15 works from his personal collection, to satisfy a $5.5 million judgment against him in a lawsuit brought by a disgruntled Austin art dealer. [The paintings have since been returned to the museum.]", "The Contemporary Arts Museum, which has no permanent collection, and the Museum of Fine Arts, which does, are a few blocks away, so the whole show can be seen with relatively little difficulty. The M.F.A., as the locals call it, has a good collection of Impressionist and modern paintings, highlighted by superior pictures by ''secondary'' artists like Caillebotte, an excellent sculpture garden and substantial Old Master holdings. Material from the latter collections forms part of a current show, ''The Body of Christ in the Art of Europe and New Spain.'' Included is one of Zurbaran's most touching paintings, showing the Lamb of God trussed for sacrifice, as well as works by Durer and Giovanni Bellini.", "A third building for the Museum of Fine Arts is now under construction and scheduled for opening in the spring of 2000. The largest museum of its kind in the Southwest, though not in the same league with the Kimbell in Fort Worth, it has made a particular effort to involve the Hispanic community in its programs.", "The impulse to reach out is also evident on once-a-month family days, with free admission, at Bayou Bend, a mini-Winterthur bequeathed to the museum by Ima Hogg, the unfortunately named daughter of Texas's first native-born Governor. Named for the lazy stream that flows through the 14-acre property, Bayou Bend, a pale pink house built in 1927, stands amid gardens adorned with statues and fountains and notable for their azaleas, now approaching full bloom.", "Reached by a pedestrian suspension bridge that crosses the bayou, the house contains 4,800 English and American objects installed in 28 room settings. There is a silver sugar bowl by Paul Revere and a refined lyre-base epergne by an anonymous English craftsman; portraits by Copley and Charles Willson Peale; furniture by Duncan Phyfe and Benjamin H. Latrobe, a corner cupboard filled with delicate creamware and another with rustic Pennsylvania spatterware.", "Miss Hogg, whose brother Will developed River Oaks, was also a founder of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Once overseen by such notables as Leopold Stokowski and Sir John Barbirolli, it has embellished its reputation under Christoph Eschenbach, whose style has been compared to that of Wilhelm Furtwangler, the great German conductor. Mr. Eschenbach's tenure as music director here ends next May, and no successor has been chosen; he himself is mentioned among potential successors to Claudio Abbado when he leaves the Berlin Philharmonic in 2002.", "Houston also has a first-rate resident stage company, the Alley Theater, in business since 1946, which mounts a dozen or so productions a year on two stages; a nationally known ballet company under Ben Stevenson, its artistic director, and the innovative Houston Grand Opera, with which the ballet shares the new Wortham Theater Center at the heart of the revitalized theater district downtown.", "A little too revitalized: the recently opened Bayou Place, a complex of restaurants and performance spaces, has taxed the area's parking resources. There are also problems with crowd circulation at the otherwise splendid Wortham Theater Center, which houses a 2,200-seat auditorium and a 1,100-seat hall.", "In 25 years as the opera company's general director, David Gockley has championed modern opera, staging many world premieres, and brought semi-operatic American musicals like Porgy and Bess and Showboat into the opera house. One of this year's features was the Francesca Zambello production of Benjamin Britten's Billy Budd, which won awards at Covent Garden and at the Opera Bastille in Paris. It starred the hot young Danish baritone Bo Skovhus, making only his second American operatic appearance after singing in San Francisco earlier.", "If I had to choose Houston's premier art form, it would be architecture. Long before Mr. Piano's eloquently understated building for the Menil Collection went up, long before the Astrodome, there were interesting, mostly modern structures in Houston's three main nodes -- downtown, the Galleria area to the west and the Rice University/Texas Medical Center neighborhood to the south.", "The Rice campus, where building began in 1912, is arranged in a series of quadrangles laid out by Ralph Adams Cram (a new master plan has been prepared by Cesar Pelli). Cram used collegiate Gothic at West Point and Princeton, but for Houston's climate, he decided that a generalized Mediterranean style would be appropriate. Rice's new showplace is the Baker Institute for Public Policy, named for George Bush's Secretary of State and headed by Edward P. Djerejian, a former Ambassador to Israel and Syria. With state-of-the-art conference facilities, it aspires to a place alongside similar centers at Harvard and Princeton.", "Just to the south rise the architecturally mediocre buildings of the medical center, one of the finest in the country. It embraces almost 40 hospitals and medical and nursing schools, including the outstanding M. D. Anderson cancer clinic. Two of the nation's most celebrated heart surgeons, Dr. Michael E. DeBakey and Dr. Denton Cooley, perform operations at the center.", "Downtown, where the city was founded in 1836 by its own Romulus and Remus, the brothers Augustus C. and John K. Allen of New York, is a forest of silver and green and terra-cotta-colored skyscrapers leaping from the flatlands. Among the best are the Enron Building, oval in cross-section, wrapped in a sleek membrane of white aluminum and silvered glass, with a neon ''halo'' around the top at night; the beautifully proportioned Tenneco building, now known as the El Paso Energy Building, by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and the massive 71-story Wells Fargo Plaza, composed of two quarter-round towers, clad in dark green glass and offset from one another by 15 feet.", "But Houston is Philip Johnson country, home to some of his most acclaimed buildings. Pennzoil Place, at 711 Louisiana Street, is the most spectacular of Mr. Johnson's downtown designs, a pair of wedge-shaped towers, their tops lopped off at a 45-degree angle, joined at the base by a glassed-in pedestrian gallery filled with trees, flowers and sunlight. Less successful, if no less distinctive, is the Republic Bank Center at 700 Louisiana Street, built of Swedish red granite. Drawing upon and vastly magnifying the distinctive stepped gables of 16th-century Dutch churches and houses, it jabs an astonishing silhouette into the Texas sky.", "At the feet of these and other buildings is a delightful array of public sculpture by Oldenburg, Calder, Richard Lippold, Henry Moore, Dubuffet, Nevelson (''Frozen Laces,'' 1979) and Miro. The Miro, entitled ''Personage and Birds'' and completed in 1970, is an angular, Tinkertoy-like construction in primary colors that sits below I. M. Pei's Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Bank Building), a granite tower, cut at the corners, at 600 Travis Street.", "Mr. Johnson also designed a quadrangle at University of St. Thomas, not far from the Menil Collection, where he married Jefferson's plan at the University of Virginia to a Miesian esthetic. Right at the top of the main axis, where the rotunda stands in Charlottesville, Mr. Johnson recently completed a geometric tour de force, St. Basil's Chapel, composed of a white cube cut by a black plane and topped with a gold dome.", "Farther west, near the Galleria shopping mall, is yet another must-see Johnson project, designed with John Burgee: the Transco Tower, of which he wrote, ''This will always seem like the tallest building in the world.'' Though only 65 stories, it seems taller because it stands not with other skyscrapers but above low-rise retail buildings; it is, in fact,  the tallest building anywhere outside a city center.", "With its distinctive setbacks, it is reminiscent of the Empire State Building (and of some designs in the famous 1922 Tribune Tower competition in Chicago), executed not in stone but in faceted mirror glass. A revolving beacon on top adds to the Art Deco image.", "From the Alley Theater to Anthony's, From the Rothko Chapel to Pennzoil Place: Where to Cool the Heels and Drench the Senses", "Here is information about Houston:", "Where to Stay", "THE LANCASTER HOTEL, 701 Texas Avenue, in the heart of the downtown theater (and concert and opera) district, was restored to its original 1920's elegance a few years ago; with a cheery, canary-yellow lobby and gleaming antiques in many of its 93 bedrooms, this is one of Houston's gems. Actors and singers love the food in its Bistro and from its 24-hour room service. An unusually friendly staff provides solicitous service.

But it's still a first-rate business and leisure hotel, with thick carpets downstairs and memorably comfortable beds upstairs. The hotel's employees try hard, but they seem overstressed on holiday weekends and during conventions. Ten of its 30 floors are devoted to apartments, mostly owned by well-off locals. Rates: For double occupancy, daily weekday rates range from $290 to $355; Friday and Saturday rates range from $145 to $205. (713) 650-1300.", "LUXURY COLLECTION, 1919 Briar Oaks Lane, in the Galleria area. The Hotel Formerly Known as Ritz, they might call it. But in fact, the best of Houston's hotels, having lost the right to use the Ritz-Carlton name, answers the phone, ''Luxury Collection,'' a clumsy moniker at best. Happily, the flowers and the lavish use of marble, plus the high staff-guest ratio, still make you feel as if you're staying on a peer's estate. Rates: For double occupancy, daily weekday rates range from $250 to $2,000; Friday and Saturday rates range from $135 to $2,000. (713) 840-7600.", "THE HOUSTONIAN, 111 North Post Oak Lane, west of downtown, is the most Texan of Houston's top hotels, which may or may not commend it to you. It sits on a woodsy, 22-acre site, and the lobby decor resembles that of a laid-back country lodge. Some of the 291 guest rooms are resplendent, some drab. The health club is top-notch. This was George Bush's voting address during his years in Washington, and where he stayed during trips back to Texas.

Just six suites, each filled with antiques and modern art, the Colombe d'Or (Golden Dove) is conveniently near Houston museums, between downtown and the Galleria.

(713) 524-7999.", "Where to Eat", "CAFE ANNIE, 1728 Post Oak Boulevard, for my money, is the best restaurant in Houston and maybe the best in Texas, which is saying something. Like many good restaurants here, it's incongruously housed in a strip mall, but inside, the mahogany paneling glows luxuriously. Shy, serious and bursting with talent, Robert del Grande, the chef, cooks bold food with roots in both the Mexican and European traditions: coffee-roasted beef, on one hand, and a perfectly seared scallop paired with foie gras on the other. Mimi, his animated wife, deftly directs the dining room. Do not deny yourself the warm chocolate cake with a beret of coffee meringue on top, or a bottle or two from the formidable wine list. (713) 840-1111.", "BRENNAN'S OF HOUSTON, 3300 Smith Street. Houston shares the Gulf and its humidity with New Orleans, so it is not surprising that the Crescent City's Brennan clan has put down roots here, too. At their local outpost, the chef, Carl Walker, adds Texas touches to Creole favorites -- shrimp remoulade with a vinegary corn-jalapeno relish on the side, for example -- and creates brilliant new dishes, like boneless quail on spicy spinach, served with a crawfish enchilada. Sunday brunch, with the jazz singer Yvonne Washington, is a real treat. (713) 522-9711.", "ANTHONY'S, 4007 Westheimer Road. Tony Vallone has been numero uno in Houston dining forever, but for me, the clientele at his flagship, Tony's, with its 25,000-bottle wine list and fondness for truffles, is too preoccupied with who's who and who's wearing what. Not so at Anthony's, his ambitious but relaxed second restaurant. The Pompeian red decor is a bit gaudy, but this is Texas, and we were dazzled by a lunch that included duck pillows with ponzu and pear essence; a small, chewy lobster and crabmeat souffle, and a flawless piece of grilled superfresh red snapper. The good wine list is inexplicably weak in Italian vintages. (713) 961-0552.", "MARK'S, 1658 Westheimer Road. Mark Cox used to cook at Tony's; now he cooks for himself, at Mark's, a crowded, casual spot in a deconsecrated red-brick church. The waiters are still learning, but you'll enjoy the first-course salad of pears, greens and Gorgonzola, and the nursery desserts -- fresh-made strawberry shortcake and a grown-up version of campfire s'mores, with gooey chocolate and marshmallow cream. Try the Chilean sea bass, if it's on the menu, with charred edges and melting flesh, or the pasta with boned shortribs of beef, or (remember, you're in Longhorn country) the classic strip or rib-eye steaks. (713) 523-3800.", "LATIN MENUS. Houstonians love Latin food. You can sample Tex-Mex at the original Ninfa's, 2704 Navigation Street, (713) 228-1175, a Bush family favorite, where the skirt-steak fajitas are still made with care. You can try Tex-Tex at Mr. del Grande's terrific new self-service cafe, Taco Milagro, on Westheimer Road at 2255 Kirby Drive, (713) 522-1999, where the margaritas are unsweetened, the salsas are freshly made each day and the pork barbacoa enchiladas with milagro mole sauce will knock your socks off (if you're wearing any).

That sets them apart from the New York Yankees of the 1950s, the Boston Celtics of the 1960s and the Chicago Bulls of the 1990s.", "The victories have not always been pretty, including the one on Sunday, when Brady had to engineer his record eighth fourth-quarter playoff comeback. For long parts of the game, the Jaguars appeared poised to pull off one of the bigger upsets in playoff history. The Patriots fell behind by 14-3 in the second quarter and played from behind for much of the game, struggling to establish their running game. They also lost their top receiver, tight end Rob Gronkowski, to a head injury in the second quarter.", "But Brady, who has also appeared in more playoff games than any other quarterback, once again led the Patriots with ruthless efficiency when it mattered most. Facing a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter, he engineered two scoring drives \u2014 aided by several Jaguars penalties \u2014 and put the Patriots ahead for good with less than three minutes remaining, when he hit wide receiver Danny Amendola with a 4-yard touchdown pass.", "\u201cIf you look up \u2018good football player\u2019 in the dictionary, his picture is right beside it,\u201d Coach Bill Belichick said of Amendola.", "As they have done for years, Brady and Belichick did not buckle under pressure when trailing late.

Still, the Jaguars\u2019 pass rushers were able to get to Brady, chasing him out of bounds and sacking him near the line of scrimmage. In what amounted to a minor victory for a visiting team at Gillette Stadium, the Jaguars held the Patriots to a field goal on that first drive.", "With Brady\u2019s thumb no longer a mystery, the question was what Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles would do with his healthy throwing hand. The Jaguars kept things simple, handing the ball to the rookie running back Leonard Fournette, who had 76 yards rushing, and throwing short passes.

God only knows how many marriages between ambitious women and closeted gay men were created (and endured, even now) during the decades-long rights revolution in the United States that culminated with the full striking down of sodomy laws, in 2003, and the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage, in 2015. How did these couples manage these lies, while striving to lead lives of decency and integrity?", "Like the series over all, this week\u2019s episode is not told in chronological order. It is 1997. We follow Marilyn from a work trip in Toronto back to her home on Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast, where she quickly notices that things are not as they should be. Two passing friends dial the police. Marilyn sits in the kitchen, her polished nails dancing on the granite countertop, as a bloodcurdling scream is heard from the garage: Lee\u2019s mutilated body has been found.", "\u201cI knew it,\u201d Marilyn says under her breath.", "Flash backward, a week earlier: Marilyn and Lee are at a fund-raising luncheon for Gov. Jim Edgar, Republican of Illinois.", "She introduces her husband in terms so admiring as to be gushing: \u201cSo often we are told the American dream is dead. Except I say: Look at my husband, Lee. One of seven children. The son of an Illinois coal miner. He began his career selling premixed pancake batter out of the trunk of a beat-up old car. And today Lee manages 32 million square feet of commercial property across the Midwest.\u201d", "Later, at home, Marilyn moisturizes her face and removes her cosmetic eyelashes. It would have been easy for the episode\u2019s writer (Tom Rob Smith) and director (Gwyneth Horder-Payton) to have this moment be the one when the mask of a happy marriage is removed, its ugly face revealed.", "In some ways that happens: In a quiet moment before the mirror, Marilyn applies a drop of perfume down the front of her silk robe, her eyes hollowed out with longing. In another room, Lee takes a call from Andrew Cunanan, dialing from a pay phone, and when Marilyn asks who is calling, he lies and says it\u2019s a business call. But the marriage is not merely a sham. When Marilyn asks Lee what he plans to do while she is away on business, he sounds down. She asks him to accompany her.", "\u201cI like it when you\u2019re there,\u201d she says, and she means it.", "It is their last meaningful encounter.", "With Marilyn away, Lee opens his door to the serial killer, who happens to be in town. Lee shows him his plans to build a 125-story, 1,952-foot ", "Sky Needle", ", which would have been the world\u2019s tallest building.", "The conversation does not go well. Andrew thinks the main point of having a building taller than the Sears Tower (now ", "Willis Tower", ") is to surpass the latter structure\u2019s observation deck. Andrew also urges Lee to name the tower for himself, something the self-effacing developer has no intention of doing.", "They kiss \u2014 \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m alive,\u201d Lee says \u2014 and Andrew boasts: \u201cEscorts don\u2019t normally kiss, do they? I am not like most escorts. I am not like most anybody. I could almost be a husband, a partner.\u201d", "I found this reference to marriage anachronistic, and puzzling, and not for the first time in this series. In earlier episodes, Gianni Versace\u2019s partner, Antonio D\u2019Amico, tired of their hedonistic lifestyle, proposes, and Cunanan tells a friend \u2014 falsely, we believe \u2014 that Versace once proposed to him.", "I\u2019m certainly not making light of commitment or the desire for it. But I\u2019m puzzled by the use of words like \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cproposed.\u201d They don\u2019t seem true to my own memories of the late 1990s, when gay men were more likely to speak of boyfriends, partners and companions, and they seem strangely ahistoric.", "My next quibble with this episode is more prosaic: the killing of Lee Miglin, in his garage, by Cunanan is so grisly and sadistic as to be difficult to watch. I\u2019ll spare the details, but the monologue Cunanan delivers before delivering the coup de gr\u00e2ce bears note:", "The monologue raises the question: Is Cunanan motivated by self-hatred, a desire to expose hypocrisy, or both? His use of homophobic language suggests self-hatred, but his focus on disgrace suggests some kind of crusade. It is not, of course, a crime to cross-dress, or to look at porn. This mutual failure of recognition \u2014 murderer and victim seem to agree on one thing, that to be gay is a disgrace \u2014 is perhaps the saddest moment in this series so far.", "The rest of the episode is a tour de force by Judith Light, whose portrayal of a wife in denial is simply magnificent. She offers a brisk inventory of what\u2019s missing from the house \u2014 a Lexus, $2,000 in cash, two leather coats, two suits, \u201csome inconsequential pieces of jewelry,\u201d rare gold coins and a dozen pairs of socks \u2014 as she reaches the conclusion that the killing must have been a random and opportunistic robbery.", "Told by the Chicago police superintendent about the gay porn found next to the body, Marilyn surmises that \u201cthey must have belonged to the killer,\u201d but goes on to say: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in his intentions. Find him, catch him, but don\u2019t talk to me about what or might not be going through his mind.\u201d", "She adds: \u201cDollars, jewelry, socks, suits \u2014 that\u2019s all I\u2019ll allow that man to steal from me. He won\u2019t steal my good name. Our good name. We worked too hard making that name, and we made it together.\u201d", "For an ambitious woman born in the 1930s to have a husband who is fully supportive of her professional aspirations might indeed, as she suggests, have been \u201ca fairy tale life.\u201d \u201cHow many husbands believe in their wives\u2019 dreams?\u201d she asks her Home Shopping Network viewers \u2014 and us \u2014 later in the episode. \u201cHow many treat us as partners, as equals?\u201d", "Left unsaid: Perhaps his being gay allowed him to be such a supportive partner.", "Compared with all this, Cunanan\u2019s murderous escapades seem mundane. He flees to New Jersey, and the police failure to capture him after a radio station reveals that investigators have been tracking his movements by car phone. In search of a new car to steal, he stops at a cemetery, where he marches one of the groundskeepers into a basement and makes him get down on his knees.", "The man begs for mercy, but his plea is cut short. And for the first time in this series I was so disgusted by this killer\u2019s lack of remorse that \u2014 for a moment at least \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to keep watching.", "At least most of carnage is out of the way.
