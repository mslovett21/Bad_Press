Unlike the Islamic State in various parts of the Middle East, the Taliban in Afghanistan or the Shabab in Somalia, the Syrian government has extensive air defense and missile systems capable of shooting down foreign planes.", "Sending bombers and fighter jets, with American or French pilots, to strike Syrian airfields or other facilities is considered risky because it could deepen the conflict if a pilot was shot down. That is why the Pentagon is looking at the same sort of retaliation used last year when two Navy destroyers unleashed a fusillade of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Al Shayrat airfield that was believed to have been used to launch chemical attacks.", "But less than 24 hours after that strike, Syrian warplanes were again taking off from the damaged airfield, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group. Beyond Al Shayrat base, Syria still had numerous others from which it could launch flights.

But I think it\u2019s basically still the one shot \u2014 it may be in two waves or something, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an ongoing response to this.\u201d", "Already, there were indications that Mr. Assad was moving key aircraft to a Russian base near Latakia, a port city on the Mediterranean Sea, and taking pains to secure important weapons systems.", "The Pentagon does not have an aircraft carrier in the area at the moment, which focuses attention on the U.S.S. Donald Cook or the U.S.S. Porter, two Navy destroyers already in the Mediterranean. The Donald Cook departed Larnaca, Cyprus, on Monday after completing a scheduled port visit, Navy officials said.", "The Donald Cook is one of four Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers that generally serve Europe and are part of a NATO rotation, officials said. The United States can use the Donald Cook or the Porter to launch multiple Tomahawk cruise missiles at sites in Syria similar to last year\u2019s operation.", "Since last year\u2019s strikes, the United States Central Command has been updating lists of possible military and government targets in Syria, including aircraft hangars, ammunition depots and command headquarters. Defense officials said one possibility was to render certain Syrian airfields incapable of being used in the future to launch chemical attacks.", "Last year\u2019s strike destroyed a number of aircraft and their hangars, the Pentagon said at the time, but did not hinder the base\u2019s ability to launch aircraft for long. The American missiles used in the attack, BGM-109 Tomahawks, have a range of around 1,000 miles and carry a warhead that weighs half a ton.", "The Donald Cook and the Porter are likely loaded with roughly two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles each. The U.S.S. New York, an amphibious landing ship and part of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, is also nearby. The New York can launch transport helicopters and landing craft loaded with Marines, but sending in ground forces is highly unlikely, officials said.", "In coming days, the U.S.S. Harry S. Truman, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, is scheduled to head to the region. While part of a regularly scheduled deployment, the Truman will deploy to the Mediterranean with a complement of strike and reconnaissance aircraft and surface warships sailing alongside.", "Whether allied forces would participate remained unclear.

While ISIS grew out of an offshoot of Al Qaeda, the two groups by 2014 had split and became warring rivals. Before the rise of ISIS, the Obama administration had deemed the Iraq war over and largely withdrawn American troops.", "Still, Congress has continued to appropriate funds for the operations, even as it has failed to enact any new or updated war authorization that specifically addresses ISIS.

It centers on Darius (Lakeith Stanfield), who had thus far been mostly relegated to eccentric-sidekick status, as he rents a U-Haul to pick up what we come to learn is a free piano (with multicolored keys) from a dimly lit Southern mansion.", "A horror movie in miniature, eerie and tense throughout, \u201cTeddy Perkins\u201d reveals itself slowly as a musing on generational trauma and artistic genius, heavy on allusions \u2014 and eventually, explicit references \u2014 to Michael Jackson. But while the King of Pop is most fully embodied through the character of Theodore Perkins, Darius\u2019s diminutive and creepy host, whose bleached skin and distinctively molded face could be a nod to no one else, Jackson is far from the only cultural touchstone driving the episode to its violent conclusion.", "Below is a (surely incomplete) list of the other Easter eggs, obvious and not, scattered throughout the episode.", "For a show \u2014 and episode \u2014 about music, \u201cTeddy Perkins\u201d is most effective, tonally, with silence. But the episode is book ended by two songs, both from Stevie Wonder, beginning with \u201cSweet Little Girl,\u201d the side-one closer from his 1972 album \u201cMusic of My Mind.\u201d", "Upon arriving at Perkins\u2019s mansion, Darius initially bonds with his bizarre host over their shared love of the album. But later, after all variety of increasingly menacing behavior by Perkins, he and Darius disagree about the source of the music\u2019s spiritual might. Debating the necessity of the abuse Perkins and his brother, the ailing pianist Benny Hope, suffered at the hands of their hard-driving father, Perkins says: \u201cStevie had his own sacrifices. He was blind.\u201d Darius counters: \u201cYeah, but he wasn\u2019t blinded. He saw through his music,\u201d to which Perkins says: \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful. But wrong.\u201d", "As the scene turns bloody, \u201cMusic of My Mind\u201d returns in the form of the side-two closer, \u201cEvil,\u201d with Mr. Wonder singing, \u201cEvil, why have you engulfed so many hearts/evil/evil, why have you destroyed so many minds.\u201d", "Also name-dropped in the episode are these titans of black music, who serve to cement the bona fides of Benny Hope, the fictional charge and onetime virtuoso who looms over the entirety of \u201cTeddy Perkins.\u201d Allegedly friends and collaborators of Hope and his brother, these stars of jazz and R&B are referenced or seen in vintage photographs, including one that seems to have been altered from an actual photo of a young Michael Jackson. (Another features Bill Clinton.)", "In one of the episode\u2019s carefully deployed comic-relief moments, Perkins also plays a voice recording reminding himself to \u201cfinish that hat for Dionne Warwick,\u201d bizarre headgear being another recurring motif in the episode. (Earlier, Darius, frustrated by a Confederate flag cap reading \u201cSouthern Made,\u201d buys it and uses a red marker to make it read \u201cU Mad.\u201d)", "In another back and forth about the merits of certain music, Perkins and Darius spar over the validity of rap, with Darius offering that sometimes \u201cpeople just want to have a good time.\u201d Perkins contends that the genre \u201cnever quite grew out of its adolescence,\u201d adding, \u201cDon\u2019t you find it insufficient as an art form?\u201d Darius shoots back: \u201cWe got Jay-Z \u2014 ", "he\u2019s like 65", ",\u201d a rare light moment in this episode where it feels O.K. to exhale.", "When Darius calls his friends to alert them to his peculiar situation \u2014 before laying eyes on the reclusive Benny Hope himself \u2014 he posits that Perkins and his brother are one in the same. \u201cI think Benny created Teddy to make up for the fact that he made himself look like a ghoul,\u201d he says, before offering a topical example: \u201cHe looks like somebody left Sammy Sosa in the dryer.\u201d", "Since his retirement, Mr. Sosa, the former Chicago Cubs slugger, has become an object of derision online as his skin has appeared lighter and lighter.

It also happens that Lakeith Stanfield, who plays Darius, played a similarly captive role in the similarly unsettling, race-oriented horror film ", "\u201cGet Out.\u201d", " When Perkins snaps a Polaroid of Darius entering the peculiar gift shop he has dedicated to his brother, Darius says, \u201cI\u2019m not a big photo person,\u201d recalling his brainwashed character Logan King in Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out.\u201d", "The stack of books lingering near Darius\u2019s head during a crucial moment was probably not arranged haphazardly, given the attention to visual detail throughout \u201cAtlanta,\u201d and especially this episode. Among a pile that also includes Joseph E. Stiglitz\u2019s \u201cThe Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them\u201d are a few books by Stuart Woods, a novelist from Georgia who happens to have created a recurring villain named Teddy.", "In the scene that cracks open this often-befuddling episode, Perkins, who aims to turn he and his brother\u2019s mansion into a museum, shows Darius a faceless mannequin in a suit \u2014 a stand-in for the father that drove the siblings to musical greatness. \u201cHe wanted the best out of us,\u201d Perkins explains, stating plainly that there would be physical punishment if they failed.", "\u201cDad used to beat you to be good at piano?\u201d Darius asks. Perkins responds: \u201cTo be good at life,\u201d adding, \u201cTo make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs.\u201d (This metaphor is particularly rich given the earlier, ominous scene of Perkins picking at an oozing soft-boiled ostrich egg.) He goes on to say that he wants the museum dedicated not only to his father, but also to Marvin Gaye Sr., Tiger Woods\u2019s father, Serena Williams\u2019s father and \u201cthe father who drops Emilio Estevez off in \u2018The Breakfast Club.\u2019\u201d", "While Darius contends later that \u201cnot all great things come from great pain \u2014 sometimes it\u2019s love,\u201d Perkins has a catchall retort in defense of his own suffering and what it wrought: \u201cMost people wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d"]},

One route to actually winning those titles seemed clear: N.B.A. championships are won by teams with a superstar, and preferably two or three. The most efficient way to secure such superstars is through the annual draft. And the draft\u2019s rules give an advantage to the teams with the worst records. As Hinkie took the reins, fans quickly concluded that he was preparing to attempt a novel strategy: The Sixers would tank, deliberately fielding poor teams whose bottom-of-the-league finishes would net them high draft picks. This would take a while to bring positive results, but Hinkie implored fans to ignore the team\u2019s losses and look at the big picture. \u201cWe talk a lot about process,\u201d he said, \u201cnot outcome.\u201d", "Within a couple of years, this process had become ", "the", " Process, and the phrase \u201cTrust the Process\u201d had become catechism for a certain brand of N.B.A. fan. Joel Embiid, one of the first and biggest talents Hinkie\u2019s plan brought to Philadelphia, even adopted the nickname \u201cThe Process.\u201d Fans in Philadelphia have been known to chant \u201cTrust the Process\u201d as he steps up to take free throws. Over time, Hinkie\u2019s plan started to look as if it was working quite well. Perhaps too well: Last year \u2014 a full season after the polarizing Hinkie submitted a 13-page letter of resignation \u2014 the N.B.A. proposed new draft procedures that would make losing less attractive.", "Sports are defined by clear rules, predictable mechanics and unambiguous results; you really can devise a workable system around them. The same goes for a game like blackjack, in which your chances are consistent, the dealer\u2019s behavior is printed right on the table and everyone agrees on what makes a good outcome. The odds may be against you \u2014 casinos are, after all, a business \u2014 but there really is an objectively correct way to play many hands. Even when you lose, the process remains sound.", "Real life is not at all like blackjack, and yet the same faith in process crops up in even the messiest realms. Late last year, a White House spokesman dismissed fears over Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation by suggesting that the administration should be as sanguine as one of its lawyers: \u201cTake a deep breath, follow Ty Cobb\u2019s lead, trust the process.\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, during his abbreviated reign as White House communications director, argued for a health care system that would \u201ctrust the process of the free market, like in telecom, like in airlines\u201d \u2014 those industries of notoriously satisfied consumers. Two years ago, a New Yorker article mentioned one person who adopted a \u201ctrust the process\u201d mantra while taking an improv class; he left his career in venture capital and got into a Buddhist podcast.", "Process can be soothing. We defer to it, almost out of habit, as if it is a machine that will resolve all conflicts, so long as we can resist meddling with its workings. But what if those workings, and the conflicts behind them, are precisely what we should be meddling with and arguing over?", "The difference ", "between a process and any old series of events is that a process is designed to lead to an outcome. A legal trial is, in theory, a classic process: Two antagonists have their say, under fair terms, and agree to abide by the result. One absurdity in Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial\u201d is that the trial, a thing whose entire purpose is to produce an ending, does not end; the original German title is \u201cDer Process.\u201d", "Among the United States\u2019 most cherished processes is the one enshrined in the Fifth Amendment, and later the Fourteenth: No person shall be \u201cdeprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.\u201d The set of rights we\u2019ve come to think of as due process is process at its best, offering a whole litany of protections designed to minimize wrongful convictions: presumption of innocence, the right to an attorney, the requirement that guilt be proved to an exceptionally high standard. Our generous conception of due process is a source of national pride \u2014 so much so that we sometimes come to expect it in every area of life.", "For the past several months, this has been the question raised as men are accused of sexual misbehavior or misconduct. What kind of \u201cprocess\u201d might the accused be owed before suffering any consequences \u2014 especially if those consequences are as informal as having people generally despise you or demand your resignation from a high-profile job? This is an open and debatable question, and there are people in a position to propose concrete answers to it. And yet we\u2019ve often seen them call for \u201cprocess\u201d as a way to avoid taking any clear position. When a White House adviser, Rob Porter, resigned amid reports of domestic abuse, President Trump tweeted: \u201cIs there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d But he was not, to all appearances, suggesting that Porter be tried in a court of law \u2014 and if Porter deserved some formal hearing before departing his job, surely it was the Trump administration itself that would have to provide it.", "Late last November, as pressure built on Representative John Conyers to resign over accusations of sexual harassment, the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and maintained that \u201cwe are strengthened by due process.\u201d When asked how she might use her own powers to address the situation \u2014 she could, for instance, have suspended him from his ranking position on the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 she declined to give an answer.", "Invoking process lets us delegate our own judgments to some ostensibly neutral mechanism, a system that will formally decide things that might be difficult for us to decide ourselves. But it can also absolve us of the responsibility to engage with the questions around us; it can offer us cover for taking the positions we wanted to all along. Columbia University, for instance, has declined to negotiate with a union formed by its graduate students, even after that union was approved by the National Labor Relations Board and voted on by the students themselves \u2014 a stance that will push the matter into further litigation. \u201cWe have declined to bargain,\u201d the university\u2019s provost said in January, \u201cuntil the legal process has been allowed to run its course.\u201d This is one kind of language \u201cprocess\u201d can speak. \u201cSorry,\u201d it seems to say. \u201cOur hands are tied. We\u2019re forced to let this play out, in precisely the way we already preferred.\u201d", "In 1968, as ", "the police beat protesters outside the Democrats\u2019 presidential convention in Chicago, the party establishment inside nominated the hawkish Hubert Humphrey \u2014 even though a majority of primary voters had supported Robert F. Kennedy or Eugene McCarthy, candidates who advocated a quicker exit from the Vietnam War. \u201cIt\u2019s especially disappointing to people my age,\u201d a college sophomore from New Mexico told The Times afterward. \u201cThe adults told us to trust the political process.\u201d", "But process is not a magical ritual \u2014 it is designed to accomplish something specific, and if it fails, it can be redesigned. Of the 17 constitutional amendments ratified since the Bill of Rights, 10 have changed the rules of voting and representation. And after Humphrey was defeated by Richard Nixon, the Democrats found themselves revisiting their primary system; a commission led by Donald Fraser and George McGovern, a peacenik senator from South Dakota, proposed changes to the primaries that would transfer power from party bosses to the rank and file. Three presidential elections later, after the candidates this new system encouraged (including McGovern) failed to thrive, Democrats changed the rules again, swinging authority back to party loyalists with the creation of \u201csuperdelegates.\u201d", "In 2016, those superdelegates came to seem, to supporters of an insurgent Bernie Sanders, like an emblem of the party establishment\u2019s preference for the presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton. At the party convention, the Democratic National Committee created another commission to examine voting processes. It issued its recommendations late in 2017, including measures like drastically reducing the number of superdelegates and opening caucuses to absentee participation.", "Many in the party have joined in support of these changes. No less than Tim Kaine \u2014 Clinton\u2019s handpicked running mate \u2014 tweeted early this month: \u201cWe Democrats need to do away with superdelegates once and for all. They are given undue influence and make the presidential nominating process less democratic.\u201d But even explaining those recommendations might require, for some audiences, the gauzy reassurance that the status quo won\u2019t be upset too much. One commission member, Jan Bauer, told The Des Moines Register that Iowa, her home state, need not fear huge alterations to its famously first-in-the-nation caucuses: \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re really talking,\u201d she said, \u201cabout changing the process.\u201d"]},

It was enough to motivate Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in rural parts of the state, but fell far short in Northern Virginia, where the wealthy and well-educated voters who were once reliably Republican continued their march toward becoming solidly Democratic.", "Lessons from off-year elections can be overdrawn, but the Virginia race strongly suggests that Republicans running in swing states will have to choose a side rather than try to straddle an uncomfortable line. Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt force, all-or-nothing approach has worked in deeply conservative areas, but Republicans will have trouble replicating that in certain states in the midterms next year when faced with a diverse, highly educated electorate like the one in Virginia.", "\u201cWe now know what a lot of us in the party already knew: The Trump message is a big loser in swing states and he hurts the G.O.P. far more than helps in those states,\u201d Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and critic of the president, said in an email. \u201cSuburban voters don\u2019t like Trump and his antics energize Democrats. The myth of Trump electoral power will now start to melt. A wildly unpopular president is a big political problem for the G.O.P. in swing states.\u201d", "Another prominent Republican aligned with conservatives called the results, including a number of legislative races, a \u201cclear repudiation\u201d of the party.", "The outcome also showed that women were highly motivated ", "to vote for the Democratic nominee", ", Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam, and other Democrats, including several female candidates running in Northern Virginia who defeated incumbent Republicans in state General Assembly races. The prominence of female candidates and the energy behind them here is something that the party will try to repeat in other states.", "\u201cI usually resist the temptation to nationalize these races in Virginia, but Trump has been an overbearing presence in this election, and Ed Gillespie chose to run a campaign modeled after the kind of campaign Trump ran last year,\u201d said Mark J. Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. \u201cThis was the first big test in the Trump era of the appeal of Trump-style politics at the state level. The president injected himself in this campaign, so he owns some of it.\u201d", "Indeed, the president suggested that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s biggest problem was not embracing him enough. \u201cEd Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter Tuesday night.", "Democrats who were worried about low turnout and a lack of energy can breathe easier. The profile of the electorate in Virginia, where Democrats have started to dominate the counties across the Potomac from Washington, was heavily in their favor, and that advantage has been steadily growing with an influx of immigrants who were repelled by Mr. Gillespie\u2019s message, and by a durable foundation of black voters.", "In that sense, the pressure for Mr. Northam and the Democrats to win masked the frictions in the party between his more centrist posture and some liberals who criticized his campaign and refused to endorse him.", "Democrats showed that they could generate energy, even for a low-key candidate like Mr. Northam, but they can draw little from his campaign in terms of a message other than opposing the harshest edges of Trumpism.", "The president\u2019s approval rating in Virginia was 38 percent in a recent poll, and Mr. Gillespie was grudgingly yoked to him. Mr. Trump posted Twitter messages promoting Mr. Gillespie, ", "including on Election Day", ", but did not campaign with the candidate, an explicit, extraordinary recognition from Mr. Gillespie that appearing with the president of his own party would hurt more than help, something that has rarely happened since Richard Nixon was engulfed by Watergate.", "Mr. Gillespie tried at times to focus on the economy by talking down the state\u2019s prospects under Democrats, but that message did not break through. The state\u2019s unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, and the Northern Virginia region that helped propel Mr. Northam includes some of the wealthiest counties in the country.

So neither party\u2019s voters were inclined toward the candidate who drew the brightest line distinctions.", "But during the campaign, Mr. Gillespie draped himself in Mr. Trump\u2019s clothes, particularly his tough talk on cracking down on illegal immigration. As a national party leader, Mr. Gillespie had been known for his efforts to expand the Republican tent and find a way to connect with immigrant voters, particularly Hispanics.", "\u201cI think Ed Gillespie did everything he thought he needed to do to fire up the Trump base, and if the Democrats are fired up and feel united around a cause \u2014 whether a good policy or the politics of Donald Trump and others as too anti-women \u2014 the Trump coalition is not big enough,\u201d said Steve Jarding, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and a Democratic campaign consultant.", "Democrats needed a victory in Virginia more than Republicans did.

The stated scope of the Jonestown project was considered viable and reasonable. Its capital development would be supported by an economically profitable organizaation in San Francisco.

When I read about musicians at that time, it tended to be in magazines, which were still healthy. Rolling Stone had a huge impact on me. There were some books that nudged me in the same direction, though.

Sometimes I\u2019m looking for out-of-the-way stories. Sometimes I\u2019m looking for practical advice. Greg Tate made me want to be a writer. I was amazed that a musician was so fluid and had enough knowledge to describe and analyze other people\u2019s music so well.

Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?", "I\u2019m kind of obsessive about finishing books, even if it takes me a while.

When I did that book, I had to break my thinking into separate themed essays. I want to redo it as a definitive project.", " What\u2019s the one book you wish someone else would write?", "I have a very specific idea. I\u2019m obsessed with the real conditions that afflicted working musicians, and I have an idea that looks at race and music in the middle of the 20th century. I don\u2019t want to tip my hand.

I\u2019ve been really into audiobooks lately. When I get around to doing the audio version of that book the way I want, I think it would be great to hear my life reflected through voices that aren\u2019t me. So maybe it\u2019s not about writing my life story so much as re-presenting it as a communal kind of radio play.", " What books do you find yourself returning to again and again?", "Every woman I have ever dated, with the exception of my current (and hopefully final) girlfriend, made it a deal breaker that I go through the whole \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series. It hasn\u2019t worked, but I have acquired at least six or seven sets of Potters.", " What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet?", "I read \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d in high school, though I think maybe at the last minute I ended up Cliffs Noting part of it. (Still got a B!) I want to sit down and read it again, fo real, with a group.", " What do you plan to read next?", "I\u2019m excited for Michelle Obama\u2019s book, \u201cBecoming.\u201d I can\u2019t wait to see her take on life in the White House."]},

Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, as having handed a Senate seat in the reddest of red states to the Democrats.", "\u201cNot only did Steve Bannon cost us a critical Senate seat in one of the most Republican states in the country, but he also dragged the president of the United States into his fiasco,\u201d said Steven Law, who runs a \u201csuper PAC\u201d controlled by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.", "But Mr. Moore\u2019s allies placed the blame for the loss on Mr. McConnell, who withdrew his support after the allegations ", "first emerged", " that Mr. Moore had pursued teenage girls sexually or romantically.", "\u201cThey colluded with the Democrats to undermine a pro-Trump candidate like Judge Moore just like they are going to try to do that in 2018 to myself and other pro-Trump candidates,\u201d said Corey Stewart, who is challenging Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and attended Mr. Moore\u2019s election night party. \u201cWe\u2019re going through a civil war in the Republican Party.\u201d", "Mr. Moore\u2019s loss will only exacerbate tensions between Senate leaders and the party\u2019s grass-roots and will probably play out in a series of House and Senate primaries in 2018. And if Republicans continue to nominate candidates who are too controversial to win general elections, the party\u2019s internal divisions may cost them control of Congress.", "The most immediate implications of the race will be in Congress, where Republicans have been struggling painfully to pass major legislation. They failed by single-vote margins to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and the Senate only narrowly approved a deep tax cut whose final details are now being negotiated with the House of Representatives.", "Mr. Jones\u2019s arrival in Washington will only make that math more daunting. Seizing on his victory, Democrats quickly insisted that Republicans should not vote on a final version of their tax plan until Mr. Jones is sworn into office later this month. Senator Kamala Harris of California tweeted overnight, \u201cDoug Jones should be seated immediately \u2014 before we vote again on the tax bill.\u201d", "Republicans may not bend to pressure on that front. But next year, they may have an even tougher time passing party-line legislation. And maverick members of their fragile majority \u2014 like Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee \u2014 could have a far stronger hand in the chamber."]},

Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News and the former White House chief strategist, spoke with Jeremy W. Peters, a reporter for The New York Times, in a wide-ranging interview on Wednesday.", "The following are highlights from the transcript of that interview, with analysis from Mr. Peters.", "Mr. Bannon is often characterized as far-right. But he has always seen himself as a player in a broader political movement that, at its core, is neither right nor left, but populist.", "In his ideal world, he would stitch together a coalition that draws in disaffected working-class voters from both parties who share a belief that they are powerless in the current economic and political system and disrespected by its leaders. Accomplishing this with a leader as polarizing as President Trump, of course, is more theoretical at this point than realistic.", "One of the unresolved questions clouding Mr. Bannon\u2019s vision to build an enduring populist movement is whether it can transcend Mr. Trump. Mr. Bannon acknowledges that Mr. Trump is a once-in-a-lifetime charismatic leader. But he can\u2019t be the movement\u2019s leader forever. And once Mr. Trump is out of office, it is not clear that the movement he empowered lives on.", "Judge Roy S. Moore, who ", "was engulfed in scandal", " this week after ", "T", "he Washington Post reported", " that he had sexual contact with a minor, is Exhibit A in the perils of building an insurgent political movement. These movements often rely on unpredictable, deeply flawed individuals.", "Mr. Bannon took a significant gamble by betting on Mr. Moore \u2014 though Mr. Moore was not his first choice in the primary race to defeat Senator Luther Strange, the Alabama Republican who became a target of Mr. Bannon and other anti-establishment conservatives. Mr. Moore could end up being what every establishment Republican warned of: a renegade conservative who won the primary only to lose the general election and deliver a seat to the Democrats.", "Conservatives like Mr. Bannon want to make the 2018 Senate elections, in large part, a referendum on Mr. McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader. In his meetings with potential Senate candidates, Mr. Bannon has been asking them to make a pledge not to support Mr. McConnell for another term as leader.", "A major factor determining whether this insurgent conservative movement succeeds will be how angry Republican voters are at incumbents. Right now, that anger is running hot. Mr. McConnell is the most unpopular national political figure, according to a ", "recent Harvard poll", ". But if Republicans start looking more politically competent \u2014 by passing, for example, a tax cut \u2014 voters may be less likely to turn on them.", "Will the Republican Party be the Bush/Rubio party or the Trump Party? That is the question that Mr. Bannon sees as defining this looming battle between conservatives. Bush/Rubio is shorthand for the establishment that Mr. Bannon loathes \u2014 the party that favors a softer, more inclusive approach toward immigration laws and a more active role for America in the global community. The Trump Party rejects those premises entirely.", "The establishment wing of the party considered these debates settled. What Mr. Trump did \u2014 and what Mr. Bannon helped draw out in Mr. Trump \u2014 was to force these issues and make Republicans take sides. We know what side won 2016. We don\u2019t know yet which will prevail in 2018 and beyond.", "Even if Ed Gillespie had sold himself as a cloned Donald Trump, it still would not have been enough to win the governor\u2019s race in Virginia, illustrating the challenges of the Bannon/Trump model in swing states like Virginia with large, highly educated suburban populations.", "That model works well in rural states, in the South and central Plains. It worked \u2014 but just barely \u2014 in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where less than 80,000 votes delivered the White House to Mr. Trump. Whether it can work there again is Mr. Bannon\u2019s crucible.", "This is a question that will continue to dog Mr. Trump, Mr. Bannon and the politicians who wrap themselves in their agenda. Mr. Bannon has denounced and rejected white nationalism publicly, as has Mr. Trump.", "But they always try to shift the blame from the racist far right to their enemies \u2014 the radical left and the news media. This makes it seem as if they can never truly accept that there are racists and xenophobes who see something to admire in Mr. Trump and his beliefs. And it leaves the impression that they might be trying to signal something subtly to these people."]},

But there is an evident devotion to opera and its composers in the company's work, as well as an intimacy that should well serve the symbolic world of Mozart's \"Magic Flute,\" performed here in English. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m. The Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $30, $25 for students and 65+ (Allan Kozinn).", "\"LA BOH\u00c8ME.\" Puccini's opera about artists in Paris is so familiar as to border on clich\u00e9, but James Robinson's production at City Opera gives it a light updating (moving the action to World War I) that brings a welcome freshness to the piece. \"Boh\u00e8me\" is also the ultimate vehicle for young voices, making it a good piece for City Opera, which specializes in them. Jorge Antonio Pita, the Rodolfo, has won praise for performances of other light heroic tenor roles with the company, and Angela Marambio, a Chilean, acquitted herself well as Mimi in 2003. Steven White will conduct. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115 (Anne Midgette).", "\"LA TRAVIATA.\" Shocking at its premiere for its daring in depicting the life of a courtesan, Verdi's \"Traviata\" has become one of the cornerstones of the operatic repertory. Featured in the reprise of the City Opera production is a tenor making his company debut: Robert Breault, who has appeared a couple of times with the Opera Orchestra of New York. But of course the spotlight will be on the Violetta, Maria Kanyova, who has shown an affecting light voice in the past. The stalwart Michael Corvino sings Germont; George Manahan conducts. Tonight at 8, Sunday afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105 tonight, $32 to $115 on Sunday (Midgette).", "Classical Music", "BARGEMUSIC.

Presented by Friends of the Arts, programs (mostly single works) take place in rapid fire between noon and about 3:45 p.m. in Coe Hall and the Hay Barn. But the festival finale stands alone at 4 in the Friends of the Arts Pavilion: a substantial program with Richard Owen Jr. conducting the Camerata New York Orchestra and with Mykola Suk as soloist in Beethoven's own arrangement of his Violin Concerto for piano and orchestra.

Oestreich).", "\"DECASIA.\" This is a multimedia collaboration between the experimental filmmaker Bill Morrison and the New York composer Michael Gordon, best known as a founder of the Bang on a Can collective. Mr. Morrison's film, which has already garnered a loyal following, is an anarchic and postmodern visual medley consisting of a huge harvest of decayed archival clips. Mr. Gordon's aggressive hour-plus symphonic score will be performed live by the Tactus Contemporary Ensemble. The project has been released on DVD, but this is the first set of live performances in this country.

Tickets: $40; $25 for the late show tomorrow (Eichler).", "NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. This orchestra's management may be fretting about whether it overpaid for some old violins, but the consensus has been that since the orchestra acquired its \"golden age\" collection, it has sounded better than ever. Not that its norm was all that bad. Its concerts this weekend are led by Anne Manson, an eloquent conductor who in 1994 became the first woman to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic. The program includes Mozart's \"Haffner\" Symphony (K. 385), excerpts from Prokofiev's \"Romeo and Juliet,\" and the world premiere of Lalo Schifrin's Triple Concerto for Clarinet, Viola, Piano and Orchestra, with the Halcyon Trio (Andrew Lamy, clarinetist; Brett Deubner; violist, and Gary Kirkpatrick, pianist) playing the solo lines.

And in fact, it performed under two names before that: Angel, when it was founded at the Shanghai Conservatory in 1986, and Orient, with changes in personnel. As first Harid and now Vega, with two of its original players, it gave a proficient and intense performance of Beethoven's \"Razumovsky\" Quartet No. 2 at the workshop, and it has won several international competitions.

Trump\u2019s presidency, ebullient investors propelled stock markets to one record high after another. And Mr. Trump was the bull in chief, celebrating the record-breaking march as validation of his economic policies.", "Those days are done.", "Even after a fast start to 2018, stock markets finished the first quarter down for the year \u2014 the first quarterly decline since 2015. It suggested that a period of calm and steadily rising markets had given way to a turbulent new era with a bearish bent.", "The plunge continued Monday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sinking 2.2 percent. Investors jettisoned shares of financial, technology and many other businesses, spooked at least in part by a tweet from Mr. Trump aimed at one of the country\u2019s biggest companies: Amazon.", "Asian and European markets ", "were down", " more modestly", " in midday Tuesday trading.", "Monday\u2019s decline left stocks down more than 4 percent so far in 2018. They are now down more than 10 percent from their peak in late January. That means the market has entered a so-called correction \u2014 a term used to indicate that the downward trend is more severe and lasting than simply a few days of bearish trading.", "The stock market is still up more than 20 percent since Nov. 8, 2016, the day Mr. Trump won the White House \u2014 a roller-coaster ride driven in part by expectations about what a Trump presidency could bring to Washington.", "At first, the prospect of Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress thrilled investors. They anticipated a wave of regulatory rollbacks and the slashing of corporate and personal tax rates. Many of those dreams have been realized, culminating in Mr. Trump signing a huge tax cut into law in December. When the S.&P. 500 notched its high-water mark of 2872.87 on Jan. 26, it represented a roughly 325 percent increase since the bull market began in March 2009.", "But since February, a toxic stew of factors \u2014 many but certainly not all of them emanating from Washington \u2014 has polluted what had been the market\u2019s placidly rising waters. And there\u2019s little prospect of the messes dissipating anytime soon.", "First there was the risk that the economy might be growing too fast, which could prompt central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected. Then there was the risk of a trade war ignited by the White House imposing tariffs on certain products, an action that quickly prompted countries like China to erect trade barriers of their own. Next came the threat of a government crackdown on technology companies, after revelations of their misuse of customer data.", "Monday\u2019s dose of unnerving news was a presidential tweet aimed at Amazon, which Mr. Trump accused of hurting the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the company has been going on sporadically since before he became president, but the onslaught has accelerated lately.

That carries risks for Mr. Trump, who spent the first year of his presidency as a stock-market cheerleader but in recent months has been mostly silent about the market\u2019s gyrations.", "It also could be a danger for the United States economy. Academic research suggests that long-term market declines can rub off on consumers, leading them to feel less affluent and therefore spend less money. That is bad news for an economy that hinges largely on zesty consumer spending.", "The market\u2019s decline over the past two months has been broad based. Six of the 11 sectors included in the S.&P. 500 index are down more than 10 percent from the market high in late January.", "On any given day, a particular sector might be clobbered. One day it could be industrial companies such as Boeing or Caterpillar, which export lots of products and therefore could be harmed in a trade war. Another day could bring declines to technology companies like Facebook and Twitter, whose profits are vulnerable to tougher government regulation of social media networks. The next day it could be energy and financial companies, whose fortunes would be diminished if the economy slows.", "On Monday, just 13 stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose.", "The meat producer Tyson dropped more than 6 percent, after China imposed duties on pork and fruit from the United States in response to the tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on products imported from China. China is one of Tyson\u2019s most important export markets. Lean hog futures \u2014 which reflect the anticipated prices of pig carcasses \u2014 were down 3.9 percent.", "After Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint about Amazon, it too, was a big loser, falling 5.2 percent. Other giant tech firms were sucked into the downdraft. Microsoft dropped 3 percent. Facebook tumbled 2.8 percent, bringing its year-to-date decline to 14.4 percent. And Intel dove 6 percent after a Bloomberg News report that Apple was planning to use its own chips in its computers instead of Intel processors.", "And Tesla, reeling amid doubts about its ability to churn out electric vehicles, tumbled more than 5 percent.", "The tech sector has been the epicenter of stock market pain in recent weeks, hurt by concerns about trade friction with China \u2014 a key market and supplier for tech firms \u2014 and fears of tighter government regulation. Even before Monday\u2019s fall, some $457 billion had been wiped off the sector\u2019s total market value.", "\u201cPeople think that tech is going to go from the Wild West to a much more regulated, scrutinized environment,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, an equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Even the shares of financial institutions \u2014 the companies that would most likely benefit from a looser regulatory environment favored by Republicans \u2014 have been battered. The sector dropped 2.1 percent Monday, with investors worried about an unfavorable lending environment.", "For markets, nothing is for sure. They could rebound mightily later this week and shake off jitters about a trade war. But some observers believe conditions may have to get worse before they can get better \u2014 and there could be more declines before that happens.", "\u201cIn order for the market to bottom, there probably has to be more consternation and more pessimism about the current environment,\u201d said Mr. Clissold, of Ned Davis Research."]},
