Mueller III, told advisers in no uncertain terms that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation had to be shut down.", "The president\u2019s anger was fueled by reports that the subpoenas were for obtaining information about his business dealings with Deutsche Bank, according to interviews with eight White House officials, people close to the president and others familiar with the episode. To Mr. Trump, the subpoenas suggested that Mr. Mueller had expanded the investigation in a way that crossed the \u201cred line\u201d he had set last year ", "in an interview with The New York Times", ".", "In the hours that followed Mr. Trump\u2019s initial anger over the Deutsche Bank reports, his lawyers and advisers worked quickly to learn about the subpoenas, and ultimately were told by Mr. Mueller\u2019s office that the reports were not accurate, leading the president to back down.", "Mr. Trump\u2019s quick conclusion that the erroneous news reports warranted firing Mr. Mueller is also an insight into Mr. Trump\u2019s state of mind about the special counsel. Despite assurances from leading Republicans like Speaker Paul D. Ryan that the president has not thought about firing Mr. Mueller, the December episode was the second time Mr. Trump is now known to have considered taking that step. The other instance was in June, when the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, ", "threatened to quit", " unless Mr. Trump stopped trying to get him to fire Mr. Mueller.", "The December episode, which has never been publicly reported, has new resonance following the disclosure on Monday that F.B.I. agents had ", "carried out search warrants", " at the office and hotel room of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. In that action, the Justice Department seems to have walked directly up to \u2014 if not crossed \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s red line by examining something that seems unrelated to Russia.", "Among the documents the agents sought were ", "some related to two women", " who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, and information related to the role of the publisher of The National Enquirer in silencing one of the women.", "After learning about the raid, the president again erupted in anger. He told reporters that federal authorities had \u201cbroke in to the office\u201d and he called it \u201ca disgraceful situation\u201d and \u201ca total witch hunt.\u201d", "When Mr. Trump told Mr. McGahn in June to have Mr. Mueller fired, the president cited a series of conflict-of-interest issues that he insisted disqualified the special counsel from overseeing the investigation. Among the issues Mr. Trump cited was a dispute Mr. Mueller had with Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington-area golf course years earlier. Mr. Trump told Mr. McGahn to tell Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general and Mr. Mueller\u2019s superior, that the time for Mr. Mueller to go had come.", "Mr. McGahn believed those issues were not grounds for Mr. Mueller to be fired and refused to call the Justice Department.", "Over the next couple of days, Mr. Trump pestered Mr. McGahn about the firing, but Mr. McGahn would not tell Mr. Rosenstein. The badgering by the president got so bad that Mr. McGahn wrote a resignation letter and was prepared to quit. It was only after Mr. McGahn made it known to senior White House officials that he was going to resign that Mr. Trump backed down.", "The articles that provoked Mr. Trump\u2019s anger in December \u2014 which were published by Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters \u2014 said one of Mr. Mueller\u2019s subpoenas had targeted Mr. Trump\u2019s and his family\u2019s banking records at Deutsche Bank. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, who have studied Mr. Trump\u2019s bank accounts, did not believe the articles were accurate because Mr. Trump did not have his money there.", "The lawyers were also able to learn that federal prosecutors in a different inquiry had issued a subpoena for entities connected to the family business of Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The news outlets later clarified the articles, saying that the subpoena to Deutsche Bank pertained to people affiliated with Mr. Trump, who was satisfied with the explanation and dropped his push to fire Mr. Mueller.", "The White House did not respond to an email seeking comment.", "Acutely conscious of the threat Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation poses, Mr. Trump has openly discussed ways to shut it down. Each time, he has been convinced by his lawyers and advisers that taking the step would only exacerbate his problems. In some cases, they have explained to Mr. Trump how anything that causes him to lose support from congressional Republicans could further imperil his presidency.", "But Mr. Trump\u2019s statements to his advisers have been significant enough to attract attention from Mr. Mueller himself. Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have interviewed current and former White House officials and have requested documents to understand whether these efforts show evidence the president is trying to obstruct the Justice Department\u2019s investigation, according to two people briefed on the matter.", "Mr. Trump\u2019s frustrations have tended to flare up in response to developments in the news, especially accounts of appearances of witnesses, whom Mr. Trump feels were unfairly and aggressively approached by investigators. They include his former communications director, Hope Hicks, and his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski.", "The venting has usually been dismissed by his advisers, many of whom insist they have come to see the statements less as direct orders than as simply how the president talks, and that he often does not follow up on his outbursts.", "One former adviser said that people had become conditioned to wait until Mr. Trump had raised an issue at least three times before acting on it. The president\u2019s diatribes about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Mr. Rosenstein and the existence of the special counsel have, for most of the White House aides, become a dependable part of the fabric of life working for this president."]},

Until we find a way to put together over $20 billion, we will continue to have these problems.\u201d", "How much Ms. Olatoye\u2019s departure would result in improvements for the residents of the city\u2019s public housing, amid so much scrutiny, infighting and finger-pointing, remained an open and pressing question. Years of disinvestment and neglect by the federal government flared into a political issue that may have cost Ms. Olatoye her job \u2014 Mr. de Blasio said she chose to leave \u2014 but there is little sign of substantive improvement on the horizon.", "One modest, unexpected bright spot could be found in the budget coming out of Washington: a 46 percent increase in funding for capital projects, about $160 million more, and more money for operations as well, according to estimates by the housing authority. Still, the needs at hundreds of sprawling complexes \u2014 some $20 billion in repairs \u2014 are towering.", "Mr. de Blasio named Stanley Brezenoff, a longtime city official and the mayor\u2019s go-to fixer for problematic agencies, as the interim chair, though he will not start until June, several weeks after Ms. Olatoye is to depart. But changes at the top may not result in changes at the ground level, where tenants struggle with mold and broken heating systems, even as high crime rates have eased.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no magic button to push here,\u201d Mr. Brezenoff said. \u201cI can promise the best possible effort to make the best use of existing resources.\u201d", "He joins a top-level staff that has seen sustained turnover.", "Of the 32 senior jobs, a figure that includes all positions from vice president up to chair, about two-thirds are vacant, have acting appointees or were filled in the last year, according to an analysis of the agency\u2019s organizational chart.", "As Ms. Olatoye was asked about the high-level departures and vacancies, Mr. de Blasio turned and muttered to her. \u201cSome of that turnover is good\u201d she said, appearing to repeat what the mayor ", "said to her", " off mic a moment before.", "Ms. Olatoye said she had stayed on until now in part to help with efforts to negotiate a settlement with federal prosecutors. In 2016, the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan opened a wide-ranging inquiry into conditions in public housing and paperwork that falsely certified lead-paint inspections. One outcome of the negotiations could be a federal monitor for the authority.", "There is already a court-appointed special master for mold. Last month, federal housing officials began requiring the housing authority to get approval to spend federal money, because of the false lead-paint filings. Mr. Cuomo last week ordered the city to choose an independent monitor to oversee new state spending on public housing.", "A spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo did not respond to a request for comment on Ms. Olatoye\u2019s departure.", "If problems had been building for years, it was the issue of lead paint that caused the dam to burst last year.", "In November, ", "a report", " by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation found that the authority had not been conducting required inspections of apartments with young children, a lapse that began in the Bloomberg administration and continued under Mr. de Blasio.", "When it was discovered, Ms. Olatoye moved to fix the problem, officials said.

I\u2019ve been really into audiobooks lately. When I get around to doing the audio version of that book the way I want, I think it would be great to hear my life reflected through voices that aren\u2019t me.

While ISIS grew out of an offshoot of Al Qaeda, the two groups by 2014 had split and became warring rivals. Before the rise of ISIS, the Obama administration had deemed the Iraq war over and largely withdrawn American troops.", "Still, Congress has continued to appropriate funds for the operations, even as it has failed to enact any new or updated war authorization that specifically addresses ISIS.

Unlike the Islamic State in various parts of the Middle East, the Taliban in Afghanistan or the Shabab in Somalia, the Syrian government has extensive air defense and missile systems capable of shooting down foreign planes.", "Sending bombers and fighter jets, with American or French pilots, to strike Syrian airfields or other facilities is considered risky because it could deepen the conflict if a pilot was shot down. That is why the Pentagon is looking at the same sort of retaliation used last year when two Navy destroyers unleashed a fusillade of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Al Shayrat airfield that was believed to have been used to launch chemical attacks.", "But less than 24 hours after that strike, Syrian warplanes were again taking off from the damaged airfield, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group. Beyond Al Shayrat base, Syria still had numerous others from which it could launch flights.

But I think it\u2019s basically still the one shot \u2014 it may be in two waves or something, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an ongoing response to this.\u201d", "Already, there were indications that Mr. Assad was moving key aircraft to a Russian base near Latakia, a port city on the Mediterranean Sea, and taking pains to secure important weapons systems.", "The Pentagon does not have an aircraft carrier in the area at the moment, which focuses attention on the U.S.S. Donald Cook or the U.S.S. Porter, two Navy destroyers already in the Mediterranean. The Donald Cook departed Larnaca, Cyprus, on Monday after completing a scheduled port visit, Navy officials said.", "The Donald Cook is one of four Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers that generally serve Europe and are part of a NATO rotation, officials said. The United States can use the Donald Cook or the Porter to launch multiple Tomahawk cruise missiles at sites in Syria similar to last year\u2019s operation.", "Since last year\u2019s strikes, the United States Central Command has been updating lists of possible military and government targets in Syria, including aircraft hangars, ammunition depots and command headquarters.

The American missiles used in the attack, BGM-109 Tomahawks, have a range of around 1,000 miles and carry a warhead that weighs half a ton.", "The Donald Cook and the Porter are likely loaded with roughly two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles each. The U.S.S. New York, an amphibious landing ship and part of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, is also nearby.

It will also expand maternity and family leave benefits, and give bonuses of up to $1,000 to eligible employees.", "By tying its pay increases to the tax break it expects to receive, as other large companies have done in recent weeks, Walmart provided support for claims by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress that the new tax law will benefit not just the wealthy but also working-class Americans.", "\u201cThis law is helping improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said in a tweet on Thursday, citing Walmart\u2019s actions.", "But within hours, Walmart had undercut its triumphal message when news leaked that it was closing 63 of its Sam\u2019s Club stores.

By citing the new tax plan as an impetus for better wages and benefits, the retailer was bound to become a lightning rod in a fiercely ideological debate.", "\u201cThey snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,\u201d Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said in an interview. \u201cWalmart made a smart move in increasing wages and investing in human capital.

On Thursday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced that it would give a $2,000 bonus to 60,000 hourly and salaried employees.", "\u201cIt is only proper that our employees share in the savings generated by tax reform,\u201d Sergio Marchionne, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.", "Walmart, which is the country\u2019s single largest corporate taxpayer, said in a statement Thursday that it was still determining how much it would save as a result of the new law.", "Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonprofit research group, said it was difficult to forecast precisely how much Walmart would save. But based on the company\u2019s average annual United States earnings over the past five years, he said, savings from the cut in the corporate tax rate alone could be roughly $2.2 billion a year, or 40 percent. He said the figure could be higher or lower depending on tax breaks the company might be losing, or new advantages in the treatment of capital investments and other provisions.", "Walmart said the wage increases and bonuses would cost the company roughly $700 million.", "\u201cTax reform gives us the opportunity to be more competitive globally and to accelerate plans for the U.S.,\u201d Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said in a statement.", "Still, many economists are skeptical that the tax cut will have a meaningful impact on wages.

Even some critics were impressed with some of Walmart\u2019s changes \u2014 particularly in expanding maternity and parental leave.", "Full-time hourly employees will receive 10 weeks of maternity leave and six weeks of paid parental leave. Those workers previously received up to eight weeks of maternity leave at half-pay, and were not entitled to parental leave.", "The expanded leave benefits are particularly significant, putting shelf-stockers and cashiers on the same footing as many white-collar, college-educated workers across corporate America.", "Our Walmart, a labor group, said in a statement that action on wage increases and maternity leave was a \u201csubstantial step, but still falls short of what all Walmart employees need to be able to provide for our families.\u201d Target, a competitor, raised its starting wage to $11 an hour last fall.", "In addition to competing for workers, Walmart is trying to improve customer service in its roughly 4,700 stores around the United States, some of which have been criticized for being untidy in the past.", "Analysts said the higher wages could also help Walmart burnish its public image as it battled Amazon for online sales.", "\u201cAmazon has been viewed as a good citizen,\u201d said Burt P.

The retailer said it had planned to inform its thousands of employees first and then announce it. But customers showed up at stores only to find them closed and began posting the news on social media.", "There were also reports that workers showed up for work and were informed that their stores were closed.", "Walmart said it was planning to close about 50 Sam\u2019s Club stores across the country and retrofit about a dozen others into e-commerce fulfillment centers. It was unclear how many workers will lose their jobs, because the company said it was trying to find the displaced employees jobs at other Sam\u2019s Club stores.", "\u201cThere is no easy way to communicate to a group of people that their facility is closing,\u201d John Furner, president and chief executive of Sam\u2019s Club, said in an interview on Thursday evening.", "Store closings have become a regular occurrence as the retail industry adjusts to shifts in consumer behavior and more people shop online.

One route to actually winning those titles seemed clear: N.B.A. championships are won by teams with a superstar, and preferably two or three. The most efficient way to secure such superstars is through the annual draft. And the draft\u2019s rules give an advantage to the teams with the worst records. As Hinkie took the reins, fans quickly concluded that he was preparing to attempt a novel strategy: The Sixers would tank, deliberately fielding poor teams whose bottom-of-the-league finishes would net them high draft picks. This would take a while to bring positive results, but Hinkie implored fans to ignore the team\u2019s losses and look at the big picture. \u201cWe talk a lot about process,\u201d he said, \u201cnot outcome.\u201d", "Within a couple of years, this process had become ", "the", " Process, and the phrase \u201cTrust the Process\u201d had become catechism for a certain brand of N.B.A. fan. Joel Embiid, one of the first and biggest talents Hinkie\u2019s plan brought to Philadelphia, even adopted the nickname \u201cThe Process.\u201d Fans in Philadelphia have been known to chant \u201cTrust the Process\u201d as he steps up to take free throws. Over time, Hinkie\u2019s plan started to look as if it was working quite well. Perhaps too well: Last year \u2014 a full season after the polarizing Hinkie submitted a 13-page letter of resignation \u2014 the N.B.A. proposed new draft procedures that would make losing less attractive.", "Sports are defined by clear rules, predictable mechanics and unambiguous results; you really can devise a workable system around them. The same goes for a game like blackjack, in which your chances are consistent, the dealer\u2019s behavior is printed right on the table and everyone agrees on what makes a good outcome. The odds may be against you \u2014 casinos are, after all, a business \u2014 but there really is an objectively correct way to play many hands. Even when you lose, the process remains sound.", "Real life is not at all like blackjack, and yet the same faith in process crops up in even the messiest realms. Late last year, a White House spokesman dismissed fears over Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation by suggesting that the administration should be as sanguine as one of its lawyers: \u201cTake a deep breath, follow Ty Cobb\u2019s lead, trust the process.\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, during his abbreviated reign as White House communications director, argued for a health care system that would \u201ctrust the process of the free market, like in telecom, like in airlines\u201d \u2014 those industries of notoriously satisfied consumers. Two years ago, a New Yorker article mentioned one person who adopted a \u201ctrust the process\u201d mantra while taking an improv class; he left his career in venture capital and got into a Buddhist podcast.", "Process can be soothing. We defer to it, almost out of habit, as if it is a machine that will resolve all conflicts, so long as we can resist meddling with its workings. But what if those workings, and the conflicts behind them, are precisely what we should be meddling with and arguing over?", "The difference ", "between a process and any old series of events is that a process is designed to lead to an outcome. A legal trial is, in theory, a classic process: Two antagonists have their say, under fair terms, and agree to abide by the result. One absurdity in Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial\u201d is that the trial, a thing whose entire purpose is to produce an ending, does not end; the original German title is \u201cDer Process.\u201d", "Among the United States\u2019 most cherished processes is the one enshrined in the Fifth Amendment, and later the Fourteenth: No person shall be \u201cdeprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.\u201d The set of rights we\u2019ve come to think of as due process is process at its best, offering a whole litany of protections designed to minimize wrongful convictions: presumption of innocence, the right to an attorney, the requirement that guilt be proved to an exceptionally high standard. Our generous conception of due process is a source of national pride \u2014 so much so that we sometimes come to expect it in every area of life.", "For the past several months, this has been the question raised as men are accused of sexual misbehavior or misconduct. What kind of \u201cprocess\u201d might the accused be owed before suffering any consequences \u2014 especially if those consequences are as informal as having people generally despise you or demand your resignation from a high-profile job? This is an open and debatable question, and there are people in a position to propose concrete answers to it. And yet we\u2019ve often seen them call for \u201cprocess\u201d as a way to avoid taking any clear position. When a White House adviser, Rob Porter, resigned amid reports of domestic abuse, President Trump tweeted: \u201cIs there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d But he was not, to all appearances, suggesting that Porter be tried in a court of law \u2014 and if Porter deserved some formal hearing before departing his job, surely it was the Trump administration itself that would have to provide it.", "Late last November, as pressure built on Representative John Conyers to resign over accusations of sexual harassment, the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and maintained that \u201cwe are strengthened by due process.\u201d When asked how she might use her own powers to address the situation \u2014 she could, for instance, have suspended him from his ranking position on the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 she declined to give an answer.", "Invoking process lets us delegate our own judgments to some ostensibly neutral mechanism, a system that will formally decide things that might be difficult for us to decide ourselves. But it can also absolve us of the responsibility to engage with the questions around us; it can offer us cover for taking the positions we wanted to all along. Columbia University, for instance, has declined to negotiate with a union formed by its graduate students, even after that union was approved by the National Labor Relations Board and voted on by the students themselves \u2014 a stance that will push the matter into further litigation. \u201cWe have declined to bargain,\u201d the university\u2019s provost said in January, \u201cuntil the legal process has been allowed to run its course.\u201d This is one kind of language \u201cprocess\u201d can speak. \u201cSorry,\u201d it seems to say. \u201cOur hands are tied. We\u2019re forced to let this play out, in precisely the way we already preferred.\u201d", "In 1968, as ", "the police beat protesters outside the Democrats\u2019 presidential convention in Chicago, the party establishment inside nominated the hawkish Hubert Humphrey \u2014 even though a majority of primary voters had supported Robert F. Kennedy or Eugene McCarthy, candidates who advocated a quicker exit from the Vietnam War. \u201cIt\u2019s especially disappointing to people my age,\u201d a college sophomore from New Mexico told The Times afterward. \u201cThe adults told us to trust the political process.\u201d", "But process is not a magical ritual \u2014 it is designed to accomplish something specific, and if it fails, it can be redesigned. Of the 17 constitutional amendments ratified since the Bill of Rights, 10 have changed the rules of voting and representation. And after Humphrey was defeated by Richard Nixon, the Democrats found themselves revisiting their primary system; a commission led by Donald Fraser and George McGovern, a peacenik senator from South Dakota, proposed changes to the primaries that would transfer power from party bosses to the rank and file. Three presidential elections later, after the candidates this new system encouraged (including McGovern) failed to thrive, Democrats changed the rules again, swinging authority back to party loyalists with the creation of \u201csuperdelegates.\u201d", "In 2016, those superdelegates came to seem, to supporters of an insurgent Bernie Sanders, like an emblem of the party establishment\u2019s preference for the presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton. At the party convention, the Democratic National Committee created another commission to examine voting processes. It issued its recommendations late in 2017, including measures like drastically reducing the number of superdelegates and opening caucuses to absentee participation.", "Many in the party have joined in support of these changes. No less than Tim Kaine \u2014 Clinton\u2019s handpicked running mate \u2014 tweeted early this month: \u201cWe Democrats need to do away with superdelegates once and for all. They are given undue influence and make the presidential nominating process less democratic.\u201d But even explaining those recommendations might require, for some audiences, the gauzy reassurance that the status quo won\u2019t be upset too much. One commission member, Jan Bauer, told The Des Moines Register that Iowa, her home state, need not fear huge alterations to its famously first-in-the-nation caucuses: \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re really talking,\u201d she said, \u201cabout changing the process.\u201d"]},
