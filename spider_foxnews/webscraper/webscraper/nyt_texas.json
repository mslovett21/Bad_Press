His task: Find out what \u2014 if anything \u2014 could repair relations between Facebook, the world\u2019s biggest social media company, and Cambridge Analytica, the voter-profiling firm co-founded by her father and used by the Trump campaign.", "The revelation last month that Cambridge Analytica improperly ", "acquired the private Facebook data of millions of users", " has set off government inquiries in Washington and London, plunging Facebook into crisis. But it has also battered the nascent political network overseen by Ms. Mercer, 44, and financed by her father, Robert Mercer, 71, a hard-line conservative billionaire.", "Ms. Mercer\u2019s standing in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle had already declined following the departure last year of Stephen K. Bannon, her family\u2019s former adviser and President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, according to Republicans with close ties to the president\u2019s political operation. A pro-Trump advocacy group controlled by Ms. Mercer has gone silent following strategic disputes between her and other top donors. Plans to ", "wage a civil war against the Republican establishment", " in the 2018 midterms have been derailed.", "And last month, after reports on Cambridge in The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian, Facebook banned the company from its platform, a major blow to any political or commercial targeting firm. Not a single American candidate or \u201csuper PAC\u201d committee has reported payments to the company since the 2016 campaign, according to federal records.", "Several Republicans in Ms. Mercer\u2019s orbit or with knowledge of Cambridge\u2019s business said that fallout from the Facebook scandal \u2014 combined with widespread doubts about the accuracy of Cambridge\u2019s psychological profiles of voters \u2014 had effectively crippled the firm\u2019s election work in the United States.", "\u201cThey\u2019re selling magic in a bottle,\u201d said Matt Braynard, who worked alongside Cambridge on the Trump campaign, for which he served as the director of data and strategy, and now runs Look Ahead America, a group seeking to turn out disaffected rural and blue-collar voters. \u201cAnd they\u2019re becoming toxic.\u201d", "The Mercers have made no public statements about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s troubles. Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Mercer declined to answer questions about her role in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle or the Facebook meeting about Cambridge Analytica.", "But the effort by Ms. Mercer\u2019s friend to help mend fences with Facebook hints at both Cambridge\u2019s importance to her family\u2019s political ambitions and the perils posed by Facebook\u2019s ban.", "Although a Cambridge spokesman last month downplayed Ms. Mercer\u2019s role at the company \u2014 saying she had a \u201cbroad business oversight\u201d role and no involvement in its daily operations \u2014 she serves on the company\u2019s board and in the past has worked to drum up campaign business for Cambridge, according to Republicans who have worked with or competed against the firm. Former Cambridge employees said she was close to Alexander Nix, the company\u2019s chief executive, who was suspended last month after reports on Cambridge\u2019s harvesting of Facebook data.", "Ms. Mercer\u2019s intermediary with Facebook was Matthew Michelsen, a tech entrepreneur and investor based in San Diego, who lists his employer as GothamAlpha, a consulting firm. ", "According to his LinkedIn profile", ", he has also advised major Silicon Valley companies, including Facebook and Palantir, a data-mining firm and intelligence contractor.", "Mr. Michelsen\u2019s meeting came on March 20, the day after ", "Facebook announced that Cambridge", " had agreed to let it audit the firm\u2019s computer servers. Mr. Michelsen met informally with a Facebook acquaintance who was accompanied by a Facebook lawyer, according to a person briefed on the meeting, and both Cambridge Analytica and the Mercers were discussed. The person discussed the meeting on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about it publicly. No immediate actions were taken as a result of Mr. Michelsen\u2019s outreach.", "Mr. Michelsen acknowledged in an interview on Thursday that he visited the company but he would not discuss the purpose of the trip, citing nondisclosure agreements Facebook required him to sign. Ms. Mercer declined to say whether she and Mr. Michelsen had discussed the purpose of the meeting or whether he had briefed her on it afterward.", "Cambridge also mounted a more formal effort to assuage Facebook, the person said, sending its own lawyers to meet with Facebook on the same day Mr. Michelsen was there. The Cambridge lawyers asked Facebook officials whether the firm could be reinstated on the platform. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, ", "acknowledged that meeting", " in an interview with The Times last month, saying that his company had not decided whether to lift the ban.", "A Cambridge spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. In ", "a lengthy public statement", " on Monday, the company stated that \u201cthe vast majority of our business is commercial rather than political, contrary to the way some of the media has portrayed us.\u201d", "In recent years, the Mercers have become among the most prominent and highly scrutinized political donors in the United States. In the early years of the Obama administration, they began doling out tens of millions of dollars to an eclectic array of conservative groups \u2014 many of them outside Washington\u2019s mainline Republican establishment. Mr. Mercer invested $10 million in Breitbart News, the nationalist website, bringing on Mr. Bannon as chairman, while Ms. Mercer joined the boards of leading conservative think tanks.", "The Mercers were critical of the Republican Party\u2019s existing data apparatus, which was controlled by the party officials and consultants they hoped to disempower. Mr. Mercer bankrolled Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and Ms. Mercer encouraged candidates and PACs that took the family\u2019s money to also hire the family\u2019s data firm. Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, the Mercers backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, putting millions of dollars \u2014 and Cambridge Analytica \u2014 behind him.", "But after Mr. Trump prevailed in the primaries, the Mercers switched candidates. In summer 2016, Ms. Mercer helped orchestrate a shake-up that put Mr. Bannon at the head of the Trump campaign. After Mr. Trump won the presidential election, he attended a costume ball at the Mercer estate on Long Island.", "Ms. Mercer secured a slot on his transition team and prime seats at his inauguration. As Mr. Trump took office, she sought to take a leading role in America First Policies, a nonprofit formed to back the president\u2019s agenda. Last spring, Ms. Mercer and her father ", "attended the Time 100 black-tie gala", ", where she was feted as ", "one of the country\u2019s most influential people", ".", "But her insistence on using Cambridge to provide the Trump group with voter data, and other clashes over strategy, alienated other donors and Trump allies, according to other Republicans. Ms. Mercer formed her own group, Making America Great, and hired Emily Cornell, a Cambridge executive, to run it.", "Yet after an initial splash of spending in 2017 to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on environmental deregulation and other issues, Making America Great appears to have gone quiet. Ms. Cornell said she was no longer affiliated with Making America Great and could not comment on the group.", "In November, Mr. Mercer ", "stepped down", " from the helm of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world\u2019s most successful hedge funds, as some investors began expressing dismay over his alliance with Mr. Trump.", "The family is likely to retain significant influence in broader conservative circles thanks to its vast fortune, which finances donations that many political organizations and candidates are eager to accept. The family foundation handed out about $20 million to more than two dozen conservative think tanks, charter school groups, watchdog outfits and other nonprofit organizations in 2016, according to its most recent tax return.", "Ms. Mercer remains a trustee of the Heritage Foundation, a prominent Washington think tank that has ", "provided the Trump administration with grist", " for a range of initiatives. The foreign policy hawk John R. Bolton, whose super PAC the Mercers lavished with cash and whom Ms. Mercer once lobbied the White House to make secretary of state, was recently tapped to become Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser.", "The family has also donated $4.5 million to Republican candidates and super PACs during the 2018 election cycle, putting the Mercers among the top 20 donors in the country. And the father-daughter duo still inspire fear: Virtually no Republicans were willing to speak on the record about the family\u2019s troubles.", "\u201cI would not confuse silence with them being out,\u201d said Dan K. Eberhart, a Colorado drilling-services executive who is active in America First Policies, now the lead pro-Trump political advocacy group. \u201cI think they\u2019re very strategic, and I think they\u2019re quiet folks.\u201d", "Any contributions the family gives directly to candidates and super PACs will be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission. But their contributions to ideological nonprofit groups like the Heartland Institute, which disputes the scientific consensus on climate change, may become less visible in the future. In 2016, when the Mercers\u2019 backing of Mr. Trump subjected the family to intense public scrutiny, the Mercer foundation\u2019s largest contribution was to DonorsTrust, ", "an advisory group", " for conservative givers.", "That grant, the Mercer foundation\u2019s first recorded contribution to DonorsTrust, could herald a shift in the family\u2019s philanthropic strategy. DonorsTrust helps wealthy conservatives obtain charitable tax benefits while \u2014 if so desired \u2014 shielding their giving from public view. The donor records a contribution to DonorsTrust and recommends potential recipients, while grantees receive a donation from DonorsTrust charitable vehicles. In 2016, DonorsTrust disbursed more than $66 million worth of such grants.", "\u201cDonor-advised funds offer you any level of privacy you\u2019d like from the receiving organization,\u201d states a promotional pamphlet available from ", "the DonorsTrust ", "web", "site", ". \u201cA donor can ask the fund provider to share their full name with one favored grantee and keep their identity private from other.\u201d Such privacy can be useful to donors who \u201cmay be supporting a sensitive or personal cause that could endanger familial or professional harmony,\u201d according to the pamphlet.", "Such mechanisms, which are legal, are used by many donors on the right and the left. Ms. Mercer declined to answer questions about whether she intended to shift more of her family\u2019s future political philanthropy into intermediaries like DonorsTrust. A 2017 tax return for the Mercer foundation is not yet publicly available.", "\u201cMs. Mercer is a private person,\u201d her spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cAnd she does not intend to discuss with the media either the conversations she has with her close friends or her philanthropic and charitable giving.\u201d", "Lawson Bader, the president of DonorsTrust, referred questions to the Mercers. \u201cI do not discuss DonorsTrust accounts real or imagined,\u201d he said in an email.", "The Facebook scandal has hit just as the Mercers appear to be expanding their business in the world of big data. Public records show that Ms. Mercer, her sister Jennifer and Mr. Nix ", "serve as directors of Emerdata", ", a British data company formed in August by top executives at Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate, SCL Group, according to British corporate records.", "Incorporation documents state that Emerdata specializes in \u201cdata processing, hosting and related activities.\u201d An SCL official ", "told Channel 4, a British television station", ", that Emerdata was established last year to combine SCL and Cambridge under one corporate entity.", "Exactly what ambitions the Mercers, who joined the Emerdata board last month, have for the company is unclear. Another Emerdata director, Johnson Ko Chun Shun, is a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince \u2014 the brother of the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and founder of the private security firm formerly known as Blackwater. Mr. Ko, who declined to comment, is a substantial shareholder and deputy chairman in Mr. Prince\u2019s Africa-focused logistics company, Frontier Services Group.", "Mr. Ko and Mr. Prince have links to the Chinese government: Another major Frontier investor is Citic, a state-owned Chinese financial conglomerate that for decades has employed the sons and daughters of the Communist Party\u2019s elite families.", "Emerdata has a second Hong Kong-based director, Peng Cheng. Little public information about Ms. Peng, a British citizen, is available. But a woman with the same name is the chief executive of a publishing and online game company located in the same Hong Kong office tower as Frontier Services. In 2016, Mr. Ko\u2019s brokerage company said it would buy a stake in Ms. Peng\u2019s company, Culturecom.", "While in Hong Kong in September to speak at a conference, Mr. Nix ", "told Bloomberg", " that Cambridge Analytica was looking into China for commercial ventures. \u201cWe\u2019ve been scoping this market for about a year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see huge opportunity to bring some of these technologies to advertising and marketing space brands.\u201d"]},

However, when Mr. Zuckerberg did take a break, he left behind his notes, which were quickly photographed and contained talking points for various topics including \u201cDefend Facebook,\u201d \u201cDisturbing Content\u201d and \u201cElection integrity (Russia).\u201d", "His performance won accolades on Wall Street. \u201cThis is a different Mark Zuckerberg than the Street was fearing,\u201d said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s a defining 48 hours that will determine the future of Facebook, and so far he has passed with flying colors, and the Street is relieved.\u201d", "But Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that his idealistic view of humanity, and those of his fellow executives, had exposed Facebook\u2019s roughly 2.2 billion users to danger. Among them: Facebook failed to detect and stop Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, an oversight that Mr. Zuckerberg called \u201cone of my greatest regrets.\u201d", "Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Facebook and its role in society \u201cextraordinary\u201d and began the hearing by explaining that Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg were being singled out because of the company\u2019s power.", "Mr. Thune said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how Facebook could be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared \u201cto be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users\u2019 information.\u201d", "In an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, \u201cIn the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies\u2019 efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.\u201d", "Mr. Zuckerberg was careful when pressed on how he defined the company, wary of opening it up to new legal liability. He said that Facebook was responsible for the content on the social network, but he argued that it was a technology company, rather than a publisher.", "\u201cI agree that we\u2019re responsible for the content,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t produce the content.\u201d", "The primary thing that Facebook does, he added, is employ engineers and build products.", "Some of the hardest questions came from Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, whose name is being floated for a presidential bid. Ms. Harris pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook executives made a decision not to inform users about the Cambridge Analytica data leak when they learned in 2015 that data was sold by a researcher to the political consulting firm. The question was crucial to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s investigation of Facebook\u2019s violation of a 2011 agreement to protect users\u2019 privacy. If the company withheld information, which violates its agreement, the company could face record fines.", "Mr. Zuckerberg did not admit that the company explicitly decided to withhold that information from consumers, but he said the company had made a mistake in not informing users.", "There were glimmers of a partisan divide during the hearing. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, asked about Facebook\u2019s handling of conservative media, including content related to Glenn Beck and a Fox News personality; Democrats questioned Mr. Zuckerberg on how quickly Facebook responded to Russian meddling in the election.", "But the dominant theme of the day was uncertainty about how to deal with Facebook, a complex, multifaceted giant that even technologists have struggled to define. Lawmakers \u2014 many of whom grew up in an era without social media \u2014 labored at times to understand the fine-grain nuances of Facebook\u2019s business model, such as the difference between selling user data to advertisers and allowing advertisers to target ads to an aggregated slice of Facebook users. At one point, Mr. Zuckerberg was forced to shoot down a conspiracy theory floated by Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, that Facebook listens to users through their microphones in order to serve them ads.", "Mr. Zuckerberg, who spent weeks being coached for the hearing by a team of outside experts, remained cool and collected while fielding question after question.", "But the lawmakers\u2019 technical sophistication was mostly irrelevant \u2014 by the end of the session, the warning had been sent: In order to avoid a much harsher regulatory glare that could include major punitive measures, Facebook needs to stop apologizing, get its act together, and show that it is capable of changing.", "\u201cThis episode has clearly hurt us,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe have to do a lot of work about building trust back.\u201d"]},

There, as we learn through a series of vivid flashbacks, she immerses herself in an enchanted and freewheeling land where she soon locates her true family \u2014 artistic, zine-producing and, as she frequently quips, card-carrying members of the Lesbian Mafia.", "Once Andrea\u2019s conservative, Catholic parents get wind of her new identity, however, while she\u2019s home for Christmas during her sophomore year, they cut off all financial support, though not before a Hail Mary attempt to shame her back into the fold with the help of their parish priest. Andrea flees back to Portland and vows to live free of heteronormative artifice, despite the personal costs. \u201cAll my stockpiling of good behavior had been for nothing,\u201d she reflects. \u201cMy currency was no good with them, counterfeit from the start. They still wanted the other Andrea, the one I had made up for and with them.\u201d", "But before we double back to meet Andrea\u2019s family, we meet her in the novel\u2019s present of 1998, when Portland is \u201cstill an old industrial river town in a remote corner of the country. Hard to get to. Hard to leave.\u201d Andrea is in the throes of a painful and disorienting breakup with an older woman who isn\u2019t interested in the same variety of domesticity Andrea is, namely, monogamous cohabitation: \u201cIt had turned out the only person my former girlfriend of three years ", "didn\u2019t", " want to have sex with \u2014 or ", "share", " sex with, as she called it \u2014 was me.\u201d", "Heartbroken and unmoored, Andrea finds guilty, covert solace in the arms of a straight man, Ryan Coates, whom Andrea knows \u201cin the Portland way, one and a half degrees of separation\u201d \u2014 he cuts her ex\u2019s hair and is the drummer for the Cold Shoulder, a local band that seems to be on a trajectory toward career-making success. As their romance develops, the sensitivity and insight with which Johnson treats Andrea\u2019s bewilderment and shame at betraying not just her identity but her people \u2014 lesbians as a community \u2014 are among this novel\u2019s many felicities.", "The author resists drawing Ryan as a sexual tourist or a two-dimensional cad; he\u2019s sincere and shy and the one who falls earnestly in love during the months of their clandestine affair. Andrea, by contrast, keeps her own feelings at arm\u2019s length while permitting herself to slink around with him, out of view of her censorious and gossip-loving friends.", "When Andrea learns she\u2019s pregnant, she decides to keep the baby, and for lack of other viable options (she still lives hand-to-mouth, piecemealing an income from different part-time jobs), she and Ryan try on the costume of heterosexual couplehood. \u201cI began to see billboards and advertisements in a new way,\u201d she observes. \u201cA family frolicked on an afternoon-gilded lawn, a woman threw her arms around a man\u2019s shoulders and they gazed at a screen together, everyone grinning and buying, grinning and selling. \u2026 Versions of the relationship I was now in played out in everything ever written, acted, sung, sold, declared. \u2026 There was so much written and sold about the love and trouble between men and women that if you lined it all up end to end the whole world would be wrapped as thickly and totally as a rubber-band ball.\u201d", "This is another of the novel\u2019s delights \u2014 how clearly Johnson delineates the psychosexual dualities and prejudices of our culture, how effortlessly she instructs even as she entertains. As Andrea puzzles out the alarming reality of her life and her attraction to Ryan, tenuous as it might be, we too are wondering if it\u2019s possible to be both straight and gay (bisexuality is scorned as a provisional space, more fiction than nonfiction). In due course, Johnson offers us her answer, but I won\u2019t spoil the pleasures of that discovery.", "In its final section, the novel fast-forwards to 2009 and shifts from first person narration to an alternating close third person point of view. Here the momentum falters a bit. Andrea\u2019s perspective is so fresh and funny, her voice at once self-effacing and arch, that the move to third person is both jarring and a bit of a letdown. Johnson presumably employs this tactic in order to access Ryan\u2019s thoughts and those of their 9-year-old daughter, Lucia. I don\u2019t know if this shift was necessary, but it\u2019s understandable why the author chose to make it. At its heart, this book is about risk-taking, and Johnson should be admired for taking the ones she does.", "\u201cStray City\u201d makes an expansive canvas, diverse and colorful, for a vibrant portrait of a woman coming into her own, in a city also coming into its own, brimming with music, art and beauty. Johnson\u2019s debut is a thoughtful and joyous literary experience, one that celebrates its characters and liberally rewards its readers."]},

Dean gathered these women together, she says in her preface, \u201cunder the sign of a compliment that every one of them received in their lives: They were called sharp.\u201d", "It is, of course, a compliment with an edge. Call a man \u201csharp\u201d and he\u2019s stylish, incisive, smart. Apply it to a woman, Dean writes, and there\u2019s a \u201csense of terror underlying it. Sharpness, after all, cuts.\u201d A virtue of her book is that it shows how each woman, by wielding a pen as if it were a scalpel or a scimitar, confounded the gender norm of niceness and placed her analytical prowess front and center. Among 20th-century intellectuals, \u201cmen might have outnumbered women, demographically,\u201d Dean writes, but \u201cin the arguably more crucial matter of producing work worth remembering, the work that defined the terms of their scene, the women were right up to par \u2014 and often beyond it.\u201d I agree with her.", "Dean has arranged her book as a series of biographical portraits, one woman to a chapter, in chronological order. She also includes shorter segue chapters \u2014 entr\u2019actes \u2014 in which two or three of the women intersect. (These include cameo appearances by the African-American novelist Zora Neale Hurston and the combative playwright Lillian Hellman.) As with all such lineups, Dean\u2019s raises questions about who is there and who isn\u2019t. Would she have been better off beginning with Virginia Woolf rather than Dorothy Parker? Woolf was a consummate artist and pioneering feminist, arguably greater than any of Dean\u2019s 10, while Parker, who could be harder on herself than she was on her victims \u2014 self-regarding writers (whom she parodied), forgettable plays, bad books \u2014 wouldn\u2019t dream of calling her writing \u201cart.\u201d", "By stressing \u201copinion\u201d in the book\u2019s subtitle, however, Dean has framed sharpness as a barbed pulpit in which the public intellectual or critic-as-virtuoso resides. Where the mysterious interiority of Woolf\u2019s novels was never going to grab the masses, Parker\u2019s brittle, witty verse (\u201cIf I\u2019m in bed each night by 10, I may get back my looks again\u201d) had real cultural currency in the late 1920s, with its partied-out flappers and collapsing economy. I do wonder, though, why Camille Paglia, the queen Hippolyte of 1990s cultural criticism, isn\u2019t here.", "Well, it\u2019s Dean\u2019s party and she\u2019s invited the sharps she most admires, even if they don\u2019t always admire one another. Positioning herself not as a scholar breaking new ground (many of these women have been well covered in biographies, memoirs and academic studies) but as a missionary championing her subjects\u2019 \u201coppositional spirit,\u201d Dean artfully shepherds the reader through the professional and personal ups and downs of each life, keeping an eye on the affinities \u2014 a taste for battle, an ethic of intellectual honesty \u2014 that made some of them allies (McCarthy and Arendt, Arendt and Adler) and drove others apart (McCarthy and Sontag, Adler and Kael).", "A leitmotif \u2014 at least until Didion, Ephron and Malcolm come along \u2014 is that of being \u201cthe only woman at the table.\u201d Parker embodied this as a member of the Algonquin Round Table, a charmed lunch club in which writers jousted with quips and witticisms. She wasn\u2019t the only woman at this table, but she was the one who memorably bested the men \u2014 her pun on \u201chorticulture\u201d is by far the most quoted piece of Algonquin wordplay. Indeed, two themes run through this book: the hard-won autonomy of the one girl in the boys\u2019 club and her ambivalence toward the feminist movement. Though McCarthy once characterized her heroine in a short story \u2014 a clear alter ego \u2014 as \u201ca princess among the trolls,\u201d and Sontag complained about being the only woman on countless panels, both accepted elevated status as their due and neither felt obliged to lower the ladder for other women. (A story went around that McCarthy baited the younger Sontag, who was suddenly turning heads, by saying, \u201cI hear you\u2019re the new me.\u201d) The political philosopher Arendt \u201cwas steadfastly against feminism until her dying day,\u201d Dean writes. She didn\u2019t think it was a serious use of brainpower. And Didion called some of the movement\u2019s methods \u201cStalinist.\u201d", "Dean teases out the tangled intramural politics, which in many cases trace back to a shared stance against groupthink \u2014 including the groupthink of some schools of feminism. \u201cI ran into quite a lot of people who wanted to cut these women out of history,\u201d Dean writes, \u201cprecisely because they took advantage of their talents, and did so without turning those talents to the explicit support of feminism. It is viewed as an unforgivable lapse.\u201d This is shocking, and it would have been interesting to know if the unforgiving are activists, academics or what.", "For readers unfamiliar with the work of these women, \u201cSharp\u201d should be eye-opening. Dean traverses the intellectual landscape of the 20th century at an easy gallop \u2014 the boozy cocktail parties; the plotting of editors in their offices; the literary and political trench wars, aggressive essays thrown across the breach like grenades. She is frank, giving us the skinny. She admits that much of Parker\u2019s verse doesn\u2019t hold up (\u201cIt seems clich\u00e9d, overwrought\u201d), and owns that Kael, the brilliant film critic of The New Yorker, was less than authoritative on subjects requiring sustained research. (In her book on \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d Kael lined up opinions that supported her thesis yet never interviewed Orson Welles, the film\u2019s director, who was very much alive.) Writing about Adler, the critic and novelist, Dean shows how a relentless need to attack can shade into self-sabotage: It\u2019s one thing to go ferociously at your subjects, backed by a nurturing editor, and quite another to launch an Electra-like offensive against that editor\u2019s replacement.", "For those who have lived with these writers for years, Dean can come up short. When she writes that Adler, in her famous New York Review of Books hatchet job on Kael\u2019s criticism, \u201cmade a decent case,\u201d it\u2019s not enough. Adler was lawyerly, certainly, running down Kael\u2019s every repeated trope and overused word, but her attack was as humorless as Kael\u2019s reviews are pleasurable. You can be so right that you\u2019re wrong, and I wondered what Dean really thinks.", "And what of Ephron, the comic writer and filmmaker whose motto, tattooed on her psyche by her alcoholic mother, was \u201ceverything is copy\u201d \u2014 a phrase that could have been coined by Parker, for whom nothing was sacred and with whom Ephron identified early on. Sure, she wrote \u201cHeartburn,\u201d which shocked the mediacracy by broadcasting raw details from her failed marriage to Carl Bernstein. But what was oppositional about Ephron\u2019s work in Hollywood? Her rom-coms \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d and \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d are formulaic films that pander, with none of the vicious wit her friends enjoyed. (It\u2019s been said that at parties one didn\u2019t want to be the first to leave a conversation that included Ephron, lest she entertain those who remained with a zinger about you.) Did Ephron sell out? Or did she find another way to be the only woman at the table, this time in Tinseltown, where she got to be as trite as the men? Dean doesn\u2019t say.", "Then there\u2019s Malcolm, who at The New Yorker has made a specialty of reportage that stubbornly hovers in the zone where truth, story, presumption and the law merge into mist. She herself, like the Cheshire Cat, appears and disappears, which brings yet another dimension to writing on subjects such as psychoanalysis, crime, and ethics in journalism and biography. Over a long career, an oppositional sensibility can become a default strategy that subtly or not so subtly distorts the picture, and Malcolm\u2019s ineffable calculation sometimes leaves one queasy about her motives. \u201cThe experience of reading a Malcolm text,\u201d Dean writes, \u201cis always to linger in that sense of uncertainty, both about the nominal subject \u2026 and about exactly what new kind of sly trick the narrator might be pulling on us.\u201d Is this the art of opinion?

John Thune of South Dakota said Zuckerberg's company had a 14-year history of apologizing for \"ill-advised decisions\" related to user privacy. \"How is today's apology different?\" Thune asked.", "\"We have made a lot of mistakes in running the company,\" Zuckerberg conceded, and Facebook must work harder at ensuring the tools it creates are used in \"good and healthy\" ways.", "The controversy has brought a flood of bad publicity and sent the company's stock value plunging, but Zuckerberg seemed to achieve a measure of success in countering that: Facebook shares surged 4.5 percent for the day, the biggest gain in two years.", "In all, he skated largely unharmed through his first day of congressional testimony. He'll face House questioners Wednesday.", "The 33-year-old founder of the world's best-known social media giant appeared in a suit and tie, a departure from the T-shirt he's famous for wearing in public as well as in private. Even so, his youth cast a sharp contrast with his often-elderly, gray-haired Senate inquisitors. And the enormous complexity of the social network he created at times defeated the attempts of legislators to hammer him on Facebook's specific failures and how to fix them.", "The stakes are high for both Zuckerberg and his company. Facebook has been reeling from its worst-ever privacy failure following revelations last month that the political data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica, which was affiliated with Trump's 2016 campaign, improperly scooped up data on some 87 million users. Zuckerberg has been on an apology tour for most of the past two weeks, culminating in his congressional appearance Tuesday.", "Although shaky at times, Zuckerberg seemed to gain confidence as the day progressed. An iconic figure as a billionaire entrepreneur who changed the way people around the world relate to each other, he made a point of repeatedly referring back to the Harvard dorm room where he said Facebook was brought to life.", "At times, he showed plenty of steel. After a round of aggressive questioning about Facebook's alleged political bias from Sen. Ted Cruz, for instance, Zuckerberg grinned and almost chuckled. \"That was pretty good,\" he said of the exchange with Cruz.", "For the most part, his careful but generally straightforward answers, steeped in the sometimes arcane details of Facebook's underlying functions, often deflected aggressive questioning. When the going got tough, Zuckerberg was able to fall back on: \"Our team should follow up with you on that, Senator.\"", "As a result, he found it relatively easy to return to familiar talking points: Facebook made mistakes, he and his executives are very sorry, and they're working very hard to correct the problems and safeguard the users' data.", "As for the federal Russia probe that has occupied much of Washington's attention for months, he said he had not been interviewed by special counsel Mueller's team, but \"I know we're working with them.\" He offered no details, citing a concern about confidentiality rules of the investigation.", "Earlier this year Mueller charged 13 Russian individuals and three Russian companies in a plot to interfere in the 2016 presidential election through a social media propaganda effort that included online ad purchases using U.S. aliases and politicking on U.S. soil. A number of the Russian ads were on Facebook.", "Much of the effort was aimed at denigrating Democrat Hillary Clinton and thereby helping Republican Trump, or simply encouraging divisiveness and undercutting faith in the U.S. system.", "Zuckerberg said Facebook had been led to believe Cambridge Analytica had deleted the user data it had harvested and that had been \"clearly a mistake.\" He said Facebook had considered the data collection \"a closed case\" and had not alerted the Federal Trade Commission. He assured senators the company would handle the situation differently today.", "Separately, the company began alerting some of its users that their data was gathered by Cambridge Analytica. A notification that appeared on Facebook for some users Tuesday told them that \"one of your friends\" used Facebook to log into a now-banned personality quiz app called \"This Is Your Digital Life.\" The notice says the app misused the information, including public profiles, page likes, birthdays and current cities, by sharing it with Cambridge Analytica.", "In the hearings, Zuckerberg is trying to both restore public trust in his company and stave off federal regulations that some lawmakers have floated.", "Democrat Bill Nelson of Florida said he believes Zuckerberg was taking the congressional hearings seriously \"because he knows there is going to be a hard look at regulation.\"", "Republicans have yet to get behind any legislation, but that could change.", "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Zuckerberg if he would be willing to work with lawmakers to examine what \"regulations you think are necessary in your industry.\"", "Absolutely, Zuckerberg responded, saying later in an exchange with Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, that \"I'm not the type of person who thinks that all regulation is bad.\"", "Ahead of the hearing, John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said, \"This is a serious matter, and I think people expect us to take action.\"", "At the hearing, Zuckerberg said: \"We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I'm sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.\"", "He outlined steps the company has taken to restrict outsiders' access to people's personal information. He also said the company is investigating every app that had access to a large amount of information before the company moved to prevent such access in 2014 \u2014 actions that came too late in the Cambridge Analytica case.", "___", "Associated Press writers Richard Lardner and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.

As the Republican Party\u2019s moderates thinned out, few Republicans strayed from the gun-rights line, and Democrats in competitive regions deliberately avoided making guns central, fearing that it was far more of a voting issue for gun advocates than gun control supporters.

In some cases, the rapidly shifting conversation on guns has collided with primary elections that party leaders like Mr. Inslee are hoping do not grow too nasty.", "In 2018, Democrats\u2019 ability to compete in statewide elections in the Midwest and in the South may depend on candidates\u2019 ability to court gun owners, many of whom fiercely oppose new regulations. Until recently, liberal Democrats largely tolerated such overtures as a political necessity. Just last week, Conor Lamb, a Democrat running a tenacious special election campaign in a conservative House district in southwestern Pennsylvania, rebuffed calls for new gun laws after the Parkland shooting.", "But the grim spectacle of students, churchgoers and concert attendees being killed by individuals wielding military-style semiautomatic rifles has mobilized gun control advocates in a new way \u2014 and pushed even red- and purple-state Democrats to move abruptly in their direction.", "Some who have in the past sought to placate the N.R.A. are now attempting to make amends with the left: In Minnesota, Representative Tim Walz, a Democratic candidate for governor embroiled in a contested primary, posted an apologetic note on Facebook after the Parkland shooting, endorsing an assault weapons ban and acknowledging \u201ccriticisms from those who take issue with my past campaign contributions from the N.R.A.\u201d", "Mr. Walz, a military veteran from rural southern Minnesota whom the N.R.A. has endorsed in the past, said he is now determined to \u201cget the N.R.A. out of the way, and get us to the common-sense solutions that we all agree on.\u201d", "But his Democratic opponents see an opening.", "\u201cIt has become a huge issue,\u201d said Rebecca Otto, the Democratic state auditor. \u201cThe only thing that has changed about Congressman Walz is he\u2019s now running for governor.\u201d", "In South Carolina, State Representative James Smith, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for governor, has faced attacks in the primary race from a businessman, Phil Noble, for having received an \u201cA\u201d rating from the N.R.A. for several years.

Mr. Cordray also cautioned that there are many voters in rural areas who \u201cfeel strongly about the Second Amendment and their right to have guns for hunting, for self-defense.\u201d", "In Florida, Gwen Graham, whose primary political calling card has been her ability to win over Republican voters, wasted no time calling for new gun regulations after the Parkland shooting, including a suspension on sales of AR-15 rifles. But Ms. Graham, who previously represented a conservative stretch of the state\u2019s panhandle in Congress, will surely face scrutiny in her primary for making more pro-gun comments when she was a congressional candidate facing opposition from the N.R.A.", "Even before the Florida shooting, however, the ranks of staunchly N.R.A.-aligned Democrats had dwindled to the point of near-extinction. After the party\u2019s losses in the 2010 and 2014 elections, only a small group of Democrats from rural, solidly Republican areas remain in Congress.

It doesn\u2019t energize me.\u201d", "Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s fund-raising success is an outgrowth of a campaign driven by social media, which has refused to accept money from political action committees.", "Republicans say they are not worried about an upset but are certainly paying attention. They point to the 2002 race for governor, when the Democrat, Tony Sanchez, a Laredo oil executive, spent $67 million and lost to Mr. Perry. They said that Mr. Cruz\u2019s reputation among Texas conservatives took a knock in 2016 after he refused to endorse Mr. Trump at the Republican National Convention, but that Mr. Cruz had largely repaired the damage.", "\u201cI think he\u2019s recovered from that,\u201d said State Senator Paul Bettencourt, a Houston Republican who is a former treasurer of the Republican Party of Texas and who is supporting Mr. Cruz. \u201cThis is an unusual year. The electorate is roiled. Statewide, Republicans are going to have to take these races seriously and campaign accordingly.\u201d", "On Monday, Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke jabbed at each other on social media. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign posted a Snapchat filter of a Cruz event in Beaumont and took a swipe at Mr. Cruz\u2019s failed presidential run. \u201cTed Cruz visited 99 of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties,\u201d read the filter, which included an image of a frowning Mr. Cruz. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time he listened to Texans in Beaumont?\u201d", "But Mr. Cruz wasn\u2019t taking the bait. He responded on Twitter, saying he had been to the city four times in the past year while pointing out Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s failure to win Jefferson County, which includes Beaumont, in the Democratic primary. \u201cAs best I can tell, you\u2019ve been there once for a drive-by campaign event on Feb 9,\u201d Mr. Cruz wrote on Twitter of Mr. O\u2019Rourke. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why you lost Jefferson County in the Dem primary.\u201d"]},

And those who do, those inclined to make the long trek to the park and its attendant ghost towns (Lajitas, Study Butte, Terlingua), are seekers of a sort, not entirely unlike the homesteaders and fortune hunters drawn to these badlands long ago.", "But nowadays the treasures are silence and darkness and undeveloped natural beauty and all those other things that seem to be in short supply of late. If you\u2019re longing for a respite from this era\u2019s relentless beeping and buzzing and yelling and \u201cDear God, what now?\u201d news alerts, what better place than one with limited cell service and unreliable electricity, where you step outside in the morning and hear nothing but the grumbling of your stomach and the muffled flap of a bird\u2019s wings high above?", "Big Bend\u2019s dramatic confluence of river, desert, and mountains makes it easy to wax poetic with words like \u201cmajestic\u201d and \u201cepic,\u201d and even those fall short. There\u2019s enough in these 800,000 acres for a lifetime of exploring, the tangible result of a landscape that has borne witness to shallow sea and coastal plain and volcanic upheaval. Eons of geological time are visible in everything from the walls of a towering canyon to the dull, dusty stone at your feet that hides the lacy remains of some ancient sea creature. From the grassy banks of the Rio Grande to the cactus-studded expanse of the Chihuahuan Desert to the oak-and-juniper-carpeted Chisos Mountains, Big Bend is a dream for photographers, a paradise for birders (more than 400 species), the promised land for amateur (and professional) geologists. Huge swaths of land are accessible for day hikes and backpacking (200 miles of trails), camping and river trips. More specifically, there\u2019s the Fossil Discovery Exhibit, where you can gaze upon a life-size replica of the skull of a Bravoceratops (\u201cwild horn-face\u201d), pieces of which were unearthed in the park in 2011.", "At the ", "Boquillas Hot Spring,", " situated smack-dab against the Rio Grande, you can sink into a 105-degree pool contained by the remnants of an early 1900s bathhouse and dangle an arm over the rock boundary into the swift-moving, considerably colder water as it passes you by on its 1,900-mile journey to the Gulf of Mexico. (Some advice: Decide when you\u2019re going to visit ahead of time, so that you can don the proper attire in advance. There are no changing rooms, and the vault toilets are like something out of \u201cTrainspotting.\u201d I\u2019d like to take this moment to apologize to whichever park ranger found the bra I left behind in my haste to get out of there.)", "At any location in or near the park, you can simply look to the ever-changing sky, particularly in the evening, when fiery sunsets of pink and orange and dusty blue give way to an unfathomable darkness spattered with a breathtaking bounty of stars, including a clearly visible Milky Way (Big Bend is a stargazing mecca, officially designated by the ", "International Dark-Sky Association", "); like me, you may have the stupefying realization that this is what the night sky actually looks like. If you do nothing else but motor around in your car, you\u2019ll have a blast. On our various drives, my friend and I spotted a little family of javelina lumbering across the blacktop, a coyote leaping effortlessly over a fence, numerous roadrunners dashing headlong across the pavement, and a golden eagle resting in some creosote along the side of the road, as if patiently waiting to cross. Finally, where else can you, at least for now, cross the border into Mexico in a rowboat?", "The Rio Grande (or the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte, from a southerly perspective) is all that separates Texas and Mexico within the boundaries of the park, winding its way for 118 miles between forbidding canyon walls; making the abrupt southeast to northeast shift that gives Big Bend its name; and changing in color (chocolate milk in one light, celadon in another) and flow (sometimes grande, often peque\u00f1o).", "There\u2019s hardly a more delightful way to pass over a border; on our first of two trips, we had barely rounded the bend of the descending trail from the Boquillas Crossing Port of Entry before a young man in a \u201cHouston Strong\u201d T-shirt was rowing his way across the river to get us in a waterlogged metal boat, the \u201cseats\u201d covered in what looked like bathmats. It\u2019s $10 round-trip for this makeshift ferry, which hauls its tiny load of camera-wielding tourists back and forth all day during official crossing hours. Once on shore it\u2019s up the hill by foot, burro, or bed of pickup truck to a trailer, where your passport is stamped and you\u2019re granted formal entry into Boquillas del Carmen, the colorful, sparsely settled remains of a former mining town.", "Borders are always porous, particularly the riverine kind, and so it goes for this one. \u201cMaps that split country into zones of topography, climate, vegetation, and such things have much more neatly sweeping lines of demarcation than nature has usually been willing to go along with,\u201d wrote John Graves, Texas\u2019s beloved chronicler of land and lore, and that goes for people too. For decades the Boquillas border crossing was decidedly informal, illegal but never monitored, a conduit for supplies, a lifeline for loved ones residing on opposite sides, a day\u2019s amusement for tourists. But it always was an international boundary and as such subject to the day\u2019s prevailing sociopolitical anxieties. The crossing was shut down in 2002, in response to Sept. 11, and reopened 11 years later, this time with automated passport control. And now looms another threat.", "In Boquillas proper, the specter of the wall seems to be just that, haunting the dish towels and koozies for sale on every corner, their hand-embroidered wildflowers, roosters, and javelinas accompanied, in slightly crooked letters, by a simple phrase: \u201cNo wall.\u201d A succinct \u201cTrump no bueno\u201d was all we got from a congenial gentleman who walked us into town, that and the declaration in small black letters on his white baseball cap: \u201cThe border makes America great\u201d (that message brought to you by El Paso\u2019s Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic congressman running against Senator Ted Cruz in November). The people here exhibit a sort of seen-it-all-before serenity, which seems appropriate, as this battle royal is going down a few miles from rock formations whose strata reveal the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, i.e., a visible record of the extinction event 66 million years ago.", "Existential musings aside, a visit to this village of a few hundred people feels much as it has for years. We perused the blankets and molcajetes at the shop at ", "Jos\u00e9 Falcon\u2019s", ", then took a seat on the colorful patio of the adjoining restaurant for cheese enchiladas, clay copitas of sotol and sweeping views of the Sierra del Carmen range (and, incidentally, a fellow skinning rabbits and goats next door). The joy in a trip to Boquillas, other than its old-world charm, is the hospitality of the people, allowing a visitor brief proximity to the kind of community you\u2019d expect to find in a remote, only recently electrified town 150 miles away from the nearest city. At Boquillas Restaurant, the proprietor offered to give us the souvenirs we happily picked out before realizing we had run out of cash (had too many of the excellent margaritas). We promised we\u2019d return the next day, which we did, to find our items waiting for us in a neat pile on the counter.", "\u201cHere\u2019s a song about building bridges instead of walls,\u201d said singer-songwriter Trevor Reichman, the featured talent the night we visited the ", "Starlight Theatre, ", "Terlingua\u2019s main watering hole and music venue. As in Boquillas, you can walk the length of this onetime mining camp in a couple of minutes. And you\u2019ll meet eccentric locals who possess the same equanimity that comes from living in isolated and unpredictable terrain. You\u2019ll even detect the same age-old tension between insider and outsider, though the boundaries are a little less fraught. This seemed to me best encapsulated by a sign on the door of a nearby shop that trades in rocks and cactuses and sundry dusty things: \u201cKeep investors, hipsters, and trust-fund babies out of Terlingua. Just look at what happened to Marfa.\u201d", "Of course, right next to that is another sign, this one directing customers to just slide a check or cash under the door if there\u2019s no one minding the store. Out here one ranch flies the \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flag; next door is \u201cJust Resist.\u201d But it seems, to this outsider, at least, that once again community trumps ideological differences among people who look out for one another and demonstrate a surprising forbearance of city folk unaccustomed to the extremes of weather and limits of technology, city folk who awake night after night to the howling of coyotes and, in the morning, find their prints in the frosty dust outside the door.", "Over an excellent made-from-scratch breakfast at the ", "Bad Rabbit", " at the Terlingua Ranch Lodge (\u201cDo you want your grits thick or runny? Eggs soft or hard?\u201d), our server warned us away from an \u201cunimproved\u201d road to a nearby city, because of course we hadn\u2019t learned our lesson from the start of our trip. \u201cYou\u2019ll have an adventure whether you plan it or not,\u201d she said, after we regaled her with our back-road brush with death (from embarrassment, likely).", "She\u2019s right. Heed warnings regarding rapidly changing weather and full tanks of fuel. Follow directions, literal and otherwise, regarding flashlights and high-clearance vehicles, snakes and scorpions. Avoid the entire area altogether during the more temperate weeks of Spring Break and Thanksgiving (or, as our white-hatted friend in Boquillas put it, \u201cthe fiesta of the turkey\u201d). Do all that and you\u2019ll have a wonderful experience, against a backdrop of almost inconceivable magnificence, along a stretch of border where, for now, you can climb to the top of a bluff pockmarked with perfectly round mortar holes left by ancient civilizations, look down on the gently moving river, and wave to people on the other side, a stone\u2019s throw away and a world apart."]},

In fact, U.S. production is straining pipeline and storage capacity.", "The declining volumes stored at Cushing reflects a more permanent shift, underscoring the hub's waning influence as the primary measuring stick for the U.S. oil market and the leading barometer of future supply, demand and prices.", "(For a graphic of falling oil inventories at Cushing, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2GRh5GR )", "Companies are now spending millions of dollars building infrastructure to facilitate trading and storage elsewhere, such as in Houston and other Gulf Coast ports.", "That could pave the way for a change in the U.S. benchmark oil price, used to value tens of billions of dollars of crude and futures contracts every day. The current benchmark - called West Texas Intermediate crude, or \"WTI\" - has been derived from the price of physical oil delivered to Cushing for more than three decades.", "Traders and major global crude buyers have advocated replacing WTI with a new benchmark futures contract that would reflect the value of crude delivered to the Gulf Coast.", "The price of oil in Cushing - which bills itself as \"the pipeline crossroads of the world\" - is used to value crude grades produced around the United States and some oil imported from Canada, Mexico, and South America. Prices at the hub also provide the basis for an average of 1.3 million WTI futures contracts <CL-TOT> - worth about $82 billion at current prices - that change hands on the CME Group's New York Mercantile Exchange every day, making it one of the world's most actively traded commodities.", "But as more pipelines are built to take oil from U.S. shale fields to Gulf refineries or for export markets, much of the crude produced in the giant Permian Basin oilfield in Texas and elsewhere no longer passes through Cushing.", "Instead, producers are increasingly shipping directly to seaports such as Houston, where vessels carry the oil to dozens of countries worldwide. That reflects a major transformation in global crude flows since the United States lifted a four-decade ban on oil exports in late 2015. Some traders and buyers argue the benchmark needs to change to reflect this.", "Joshua Wade, a crude oil marketer in Oklahoma, sees the benchmark delivery point moving south before long.", "\"That's the direction it's moving,\" he said. \"As opposed to importing, now you're exporting through the same infrastructure ... The oil capital of the nation is in Houston.\"", "Inventories in Cushing fell to 28.2 million barrels in early March, lowest in more than three years.", "Analysts say a level of 20 million barrels is effectively empty. That's because tank design necessitates a minimum volume of crude be kept on hand to maintain the physical integrity of the complex and to allow for blending different crude grades to comply with pipeline specifications.", "\"There has been a major structural shift in crude flows within the U.S.,\" said John Coleman, senior research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. \"I think Cushing is rapidly losing its relevance.\"", "A CENTURY-OLD WAY STATION", "Cushing got its distinction in the early 1920s when tanks sprung up to store oil en route from Oklahoma and Texas to major metropolitan areas and refineries in the Midwest.", "In 1983, it became the delivery point for the newly-launched WTI futures contract <CLc1>. Because the U.S. relied on imports - and banned exports - Cushing was key for traders to gauge domestic supply trends.", "BP's former head of crude trading, Donald Porteous, earned the nickname \"the King of Cushing\" because of his deep understanding of supply logistics in the Oklahoma town - a strategy that often earned him more money than BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley.", "Porteous, now retired, declined to comment for this story.", "Now, new pipeline projects head straight from west Texas to the Gulf of Mexico, a route well south of Cushing. Lately, Permian Basin prices have declined because pipelines can't be built fast enough to get crude to the Gulf, even as pipeline firms have added about 600,000 bpd in capacity since late last year, according to data compiled by Reuters.", "\"We're trying to make sure we're ahead of the pinch points for producers to bring product to refiners or to export,\" Greg Armstrong, chief executive of Plains All American, said at a recent industry conference.", "Projects in the works could boost outgoing pipeline capacity from the Permian from 2.7 million bpd in March to more than 4.5 million bpd by the end of 2019, according to energy industry information provider Genscape.", "Meanwhile, the Dakota Access pipeline started shipping oil last year, running out of North Dakota's Bakken shale region to the Gulf - bypassing Cushing. And Marathon Petroleum is considering reversing its Capline crude line to bring barrels from Illinois to the Gulf.", "A BENCHMARK SHIFT?", "For now, traders watch the price differential between WTI and London-based Brent crude to determine where to ferry shipments globally.", "But traders say the price of physical trades in Houston is growing more important as a barometer for shippers. Earlier this year, even as the WTI crude discount to Brent <WTCLc1-LCOc1> narrowed, Houston's discount to Brent remained steady at about $1.60 (\u00a31.12) a barrel, analysts said, helping buoy export demand.", "As pipeline capacity to the Gulf has increased, and storage has expanded, demand to park barrels in Cushing has waned, said Carlin Conner, chief executive at SemGroup Corp, which operates about 7.6 million barrels of crude oil storage in Cushing.", "A spokesman for Magellan Midstream Partners, which owns about 12 million barrels of Cushing storage, said it will remain important because of its connections to the Gulf and Midwest.", "Cushing is also connected via pipeline to the Gulf, 500 miles to the south, and can offer cheaper storage than what's available on the coast, said SemGroup's Conner.", "\"I believe Cushing's next chapter,\" he said, \"is that it's going to become an offsite Gulf Coast storage centre.\"", "(Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Additional reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York; Editing by David Gaffen, Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot)"]}
