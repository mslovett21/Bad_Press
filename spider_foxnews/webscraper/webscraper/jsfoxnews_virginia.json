What other issues do you think are really important?\u00a0", "JULIAN WALKER, VIRGINIAN PILOT NEWSPAPER: Well one of the ones in Prince William, in this swing county, is immigration, where this county in fact several years ago had a local ordinance which essentially became kind of a model for the law that Arizona passed in order to allow local law enforcement to check the immigration status \u2013 the lawful presence or lack thereof -- of folks who were stopped in this county, detained by law enforcement for one reason or another. That became a very hot issue several years ago. In fact one of the candidates for statewide office next year, for lieutenant governor, Corey Stewart, who is now on the local board of supervisors here, he was kind of the architect behind that, the spearhead of that effort. And so here in Prince William County particularly that is an issue that is a hot button one.\u00a0", "BAIER: Do you agree?\u00a0", "DAVID SHERFINSKI, WASHINGTON TIMES: Absolutely, especially in the wake of the attention that immigration has gotten at the U.S. Supreme Court.\u00a0", "The issue has kind of been under the radar, I would say, over the past five years since the flash point of 2007 when the ordinance was first passed. But with Corey Stewart running for statewide office it definitely will be in play with both sides battling for the Hispanic vote.\u00a0", "BAIER: It's interesting that there are a lot of federal workers in this area, it's a bit further from Washington D.C.", "(CROSSTALK)", "BAIER: But there's a lot of commuters. So how does the cutting back on the federal government play with people in this place?\u00a0", "LEWIS: Well, if the federal government finally does actually cut back. But what you've got here are people who -- there is more private industry here, there's more private sector going on here than people realize. It's not just federally dependent and it's not as federally dependent as Fairfax County just to the north. I think there is a better balance here than there is up north. I think what you have got here is a stronger conservative base. And it leavens itself out when you consider the private sector growth and employment base here versus the federal workforce that's in Prince William County.\u00a0", "BAIER: When the Obama campaign though looks at this county, Julian, they probably look to 2008 where he carried it with 58 percent of the vote. What do you think they're going to be focusing on? You mentioned immigration, and obviously that will be a factor, but what other plays do you think they'll make here?\u00a0", "WALKER: Well, I think you mentioned it. I think the economy is one. Everybody, this is a kitchen table pocketbook election. People feel anxious now. They want to feel better, they want to feel encouraged that things are getting better. And that's the salesman job that he has to try to accomplish. So that's one thing.\u00a0", "Another thing that's big in Virginia is energy. Gas prices at the pump the thing that you see every day when you fill up your vehicle. But beyond that, we've got in Hampton Roads we've got a big ongoing debate about whether or not we should explore offshore for oil and natural gas. In the Southwestern part of the state you've got the coal industry, which is a big bedrock of this state and its economy. In the central part of the state, you've got the looming debate over whether or not to allow uranium mining. There has been a 30-year moratorium in Virginia on that. And so both the economy and I would say energy are the kind of key kitchen table issues that you're will see play out in this election.\u00a0", "BAIER: David, do you sense that this is kind of developing to be a center point for both ads and time for the candidates to spend?\u00a0", "SHERFINSKI: Oh absolutely, I mean, especially with a high stakes U.S. senate election between Tim Kaine and George Allen already reserving millions of dollars in air time in the costly Washington D.C. suburbs, this is -- this along with the Richmond area and the Hampton Roads areas, what's known as kind of the \"urban crescent\" or the \"golden crescent\" in Virginia where there are just so many voters to be had by each side.\u00a0", "BAIER: But yet unemployment is very low here, 4.7 percent. So I mean, obvious the economy drives the day, but overall people are working here.\u00a0", "LEWIS: Yeah. The economy here is good. You have pockets where the economy is not so good. Southside, in rural Virginia, in Martinsville, Pittsylvania County, Henry County, you've got horrible unemployment. Southwest Virginia, the unemployment rates are high, double digit. So the message has to be tailored differently in different places. And where the unemployment rate is high I think President Obama has a higher bar to clear. But David just mentioned, people in Virginia aren't used to an ad war like we're seeing here now already. We were a swing state in '08 but we didn't know it.\u00a0", "BAIER: Right.\u00a0", "LEWIS: And so you didn't see all these ads. And before that, the candidates sort of passed us by and said we know Virginia is going Republican. It has for 44 years --", "BAIER: Right.", "LEWIS: And now you see wall to wall advertising. It's not going to be safe to turn the television on by the time October gets here.\u00a0", "BAIER: It'll be something to watch. Bob, Julian, David, thank you very much for the time. Very interesting. We'll be back many times.\u00a0", "Stay with us. We'll go to our national panel next from D.C.", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"]},

Because when he asked me to be the chairman of his campaign of Virginia, I answered it, yes because it is such an important issue. You know, look, I mean, we talk about these dreamers, 57 percent of them are adults and in Prince William County, one of these so-called dreamers was released by the Obama administration and killed a nun. These aren't just a bunch of innocent people, a bunch of innocent kids that came out and want to make a better life for themselves. A lot of these are adults, they're engaged in criminal activity.

Certainly to deport some 11 million people is a burden on American taxpayers. These predominantly are young people who have come here trying to build a life. Many of them have great educations. And they want to contribute to the greatness of this country. I think that for Donald Trump to begin to illustrate that he comprehends the difference between the rhetoric of a campaign and the reality of being president of the greatest nation in the world, illustrate real leadership and I for one am very encouraged by what I've heard.", "MACCALLUM: So, Charlie, I think back on some of the promises of President Obama, he said he was going to close Gitmo. He said if you liked your doctor, you can keep your doctor. And he is been criticized for not sticking to his word. So, do you criticize Donald Trump for doing the same?", "CHARLES HURT, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, I mean, certainly what we heard today is a different tone about immigration. But honestly Martha, I don't see any substantive difference between what he said during the campaign and what he is saying now. He is still talking about tearing up the executive order that President Obama signed regarding the dreamers. Not only because it is a terrible policy but because it is unconstitutional. And so that -- he is still going to do that. The question of what to do with the people that are here has been something that, you know, lawmakers have grappled with for 10, 15 ever since 1986, the last time they promised to fix this problem.", "The real thing that matters most of all is, are you going to fix the problem going forward? And obviously part of that means that you do deport people who are here illegally especially those people who are here illegally and breaking laws in addition to being here illegally.", "MACCALLUM: Yes.", "HURT: But I think there is wiggle room for negotiation after that.", "MACCALLUM: You have to prioritize. And I think that's what he's talked about quite a bit. So, Corey, I want to go back to you on this. Because he said, basically you want to build a wall. So you want to, you know, put a stopper in the opening of that is allowing people to flow through. Then you want to get rid of the criminals first, he said. So, that's going to take a while to achieve those two goals. And then and only then do you move on to the next category of people, right, Corey?", "STEWART: Well, I would agree with that prioritization. And it certainly makes sense, you know, secure the border, go after the criminals first. \u00a0I'm completely, you know, that's what we did in Prince William County to great effect. But you know, one of the things that has to be done here, is we have to establish law and order in our immigration system. If we don't enforce the law, the law that Congress and the President created, not the President alone, then what's the point of even reforming the law if we're not going to enforce it?", "MACCALLUM: Yes.", "STEWART: And that the first thing that Trump needs to make good on the promise. That's the most important thing. He needs do what Reagan did when, you know, by firing the air traffic controllers 35 years ago. He needs to establish that he is serious, he is going to keep his promises and that, you know, if you dealt that, he is going to make it very clear at very beginning of his administration that instead of breaking promises, he is going to keep them.", "MACCALLUM: You know, Javier, it seems that Donald Trump as many presidents do, they've sort of start with the pendulum all the wait to one side. They want to make a very clear point during the campaign. And they want to make it clear to people that they are serious about it. Then they have to start to move towards the ability to actually take action on it. But, you know, in terms of Corey's point, we have laws in this country. You are not allowed to be here illegally. And it does seems sometimes like there are different laws for certain immigrants crossing the border and different laws for others who seemed to get kicked out and have to stay away for years and work their way back in. So, why isn't the same for everyone?", "PALOMAREZ: Listen, what I can tell you is that in my conversations with the Trump team, I have witnessed them illustrate a real willingness to comprehend the issue in its broadest context. We have tried to insure that they understand the important economic and commercial implications to this thorny and often emotional issue called immigration reform. At the end of the day, these people are predominantly employed, predominantly working in this country to deport them in a mass fashion would cost anywhere from 300 to $400 billion to the American economy.", "And I'm glad that the issue was brought up about Ronald Reagan. Because you will recall that Ronald Reagan basically pardoned millions of people at the time that he was president and that he illustrated that we are a country of broad shoulders and big hearts. It is time that Donald Trump did that. I'm very encouraged by the fact that he is willing to at least stop and pump the brakes just a little bit and look at this thing for what it truly is.", "MACCALLUM: Well, he's going to have to walk a fine line.", "HURT: And amnesty, those three million turned into 12 million plus.", "MACCALLUM: Yes.", "HURT: And that's why it has to be done.

And all people who didn't speak out for the ones that stuck around, you know, that he didn't get rid of. So, when he says that he didn't hear about this from the intelligence community, that's malarkey.

And Admiral Rogers, the head of NSA who is one of the people that trump is considering to replace General Clapper, he said we underestimated them.", "That's what Obama was trying to say. People knew they were there but they underestimated how quickly they would be able to get into Iraq and the Iraqi army would collapse. I think that's exactly what he's saying. And again, you know, intelligence people make mistakes. General Flynn was blaming Benghazi on Iran, which wasn't true.", "MACCALLUM: Larry, they do make mistakes. But I guess, what some people will take issue is in watching this interview, is why wouldn't the President say at this point, you know what, upon reflection there were people who were speaking out very strongly on this matter, and it would have been wise to have paid attention to them. You get a lot of information incoming.", "And I chose to, you know, follow some people's take on whether or not they could be contained. But this is a period during which people were being beheaded.

He has no understanding of what went wrong and he doesn't care to understand because he has his agenda. And he doesn't care too is that I was there in 2009 and I put this in my first book that this was going to be a problem. We were pulling out of Iraq.", "There was power vacuums happening. The violence was escalating and they didn't want to admit that. So what they did was they stopped all American troop direct action mission. So, we weren't allowed to go kill bad guys which is what we are trained to do as soldiers. And then they claimed victory. Well, the enemy get to say whether or not the war is over and they were saying it wasn't over and we just pulled out anyway.", "MACCALLUM: Larry, last word?", "KORB: Wait! Wait a second. President Bush signed an agreement that said, we had to get out by the end of 2011 and we had to, in early 2009 stop our combat missions. This was not Obama who did that. And General Petraeus --", "HIGBIE: But Obama didn't try to change it.", "KORB: Yes. But General Petraeus said even if you had left 10,000 troops there he doesn't think it would have made any difference. Because it was malarkey the way he ran the place and he wouldn't allow our troops to stay there without a status of forces agreement.", "MACCALLUM: A lot of people believe that that status of forces agreement could have been reached. And President Bush himself actually warned about leaving a vacuum in that area and he said that terrorist elements would fill that vacuum if it was left. So, you know, I guess my point is that when you have 2020 and you have the hindsight on it, what would behoove a president or any leader would be to be as clear-eyed as possible in explaining what happened so that the next president could see it in a way that might be more helpful to him instead of perhaps throwing people under the bus that don't deserve it.", "So, Larry, thank you very much.

So, Chris, very nice move. Is this normally what we see with a President-elect?", "CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, it depends on how you're rolling when you get there. In Donald Trump's case he may have squeaked over the finish line to a certain degree but he has gotten a -- the honeymoon is more pronounced for him. Barack Obama came into office popular. He went into election Day fairly popular eight years ago. This time Donald Trump was lugging what looked like overwhelming negatives. \u00a0People were very down on him.", "You remember a month ago, it was just a month and a day ago that we had the election. A month ago and three weeks ago people were saying should Donald Trump be normalized? Should -- and critics said should the president have even welcomed him to the White House and all this stuff. A month later, you know, we're saying, well, half the country says they feel pretty good about him. And, by the way, on his core policy sets, people are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. So Trump definitely has changed the landscape around him.", "MCCALLUM: He always said that he could be presidential.

You've got Al Gore and Rob Emmanuel coming to meet with Donald Trump.", "STIREWALT: That's right.", "MACCALLUM: And, you know, Kellyanne Conway said that President Obama and Donald Trump have spent 30 hours on the phone together.", "STIREWALT: That's a lot of hours.", "MACCALLUM: Is that possible?", "STIREWALT: That's a lot of hours.", "MACCALLUM: I haven't spent 30 hours on the phone since eighth grade. So, I don't know what they're talking about, Chris, but they have a lot to talk about.", "STIREWALT: And I can picture they're twisting the cord around your finger and talking to your friends. I know. I would say that what part of Donald Trump was benefiting from is that there was a caricature of him that certainly that his political opponents, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats laid out there, but also there was in the press. He's a Nazi, he's a monster. He's evil. He is going to drink the blood of the children of America, run and hide. He's the crampiest. And then he showed up and went, oh, he's kind of funny. I think I like him.", "MACCALLUM: So you start there.", "STIREWALT: Right.", "MACCALLUM: You can only go up.", "STIREWALT: That's right. And he's being moderate, and he's making these cooing noises that liberals like, even though he's appointing people that are really conservative.", "MACCALLUM: Fascinating. Chris, thank you very much.", "STIREWALT: You bet.", "MACCALLUM: Always good to see you, sir. Come see us in the morning. All Right.", "So, let's be joined now by Republican congressman Sean Duffy, and Richard Fowler of Fox News contributor and national syndicated radio talk show host. Welcome, gentlemen. Hello, there. Good to have you all here. So, Richard, I know -- you were smiling broadly as Chris and I were talking. \u00a0What do you think about all that?", "RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think there's some truth to what Chris is saying here. I think every president gets a honeymoon phase after they win. The American people are looking for him to provide answers, and to create jobs, and to build this wall, and all these other things. And so, I think, that's what we're going to wait and see what happens. Now, I think Donald Trump has a couple of problems. I think problem number one is that as he gets into his first 100 days he's going to want to pass this trillion dollar transportation or infrastructure bill, which I think is a great idea if done correctly. And I think budget hawk like Congressman Duffy and others will be like, oh, trillion dollars, too much, we need to lower that number. And that's where you're going to see the big eruption that will be Trump taking on his own party.", "MACCALLUM: Well, Representative Duffy, I thought it was interesting in the interview that Donald Trump did today, he said, I would like to be judge on my presidency starting now. Starting when I got elected because the Dow is at an all-time high, I mean the market has responded incredibly positively, so far to the Trump transition, part of this process. But if he comes forward with that bill, are you going to give him hard time about how to pay for it?", "REP. SEAN DUFFY, R-WIS.: Well, it depends. If he doesn't pay for it, we'll obviously have trouble with it. But there's great pain for us, I mean, we can repatriate foreign profits back to the states, whether we charge five, eight, 10 percent interest. You can pay about 3 or $400 billion of that trillion dollar expenditure. But, listen, Martha, we're trillion dollars in debt. To think that we're going to add another trillion of unpaid spending on top of it, that's not going to happen. But what's interesting is liberals across America, like, maybe a little bit of Richard, their hair is on fire. They're pulling out. They can't believe the evil Donald Trump is actually, you know, warming up to the American people, and they kind of like him. They want to give him a shot. But what's interesting is -- just one second, only 28 percent of Americans want Democrats to oppose Donald Trump, and Republicans in congress, they actually want them to work with us to secure the border, fix healthcare, and grow the economy, which is really remarkable for Democrats to have this push on their own side and say work together and get some of these big initiatives done.", "MACCALLUM: I find it fascinating. This is really what I think is the most interesting. So, Richard, tell me, you know, do you believe -- are you willing to give Donald Trump a chance? I mean, the people were sobbing and devastated after this election in, you know, half of the country, essentially, right? Are they starting to feel better or do they think this is not real?", "FOWLER: Well, listen. I respect the presidency of the United States, the person in it, that's another story, depending upon who it is every four areas. But here's the thing, I think the American people they were angry, and they were frustrated. They felt the economy was rigged. I think millennials especially felt that going into November -- going into last month as Chris Stirewalt said, and now Donald Trump has to prove that he can really quote, unquote, make America great again. And like Congressman Duffy pointed out, he's going to have some trouble in his own caucus making that a reality. The same thing that he's proposing, the same thing Barack Obama proposed 8 years ago, a trillion dollars infrastructure bill, and Republicans blocked it tooth and nail, and he's just indicated they're going to do it again.", "(CROSSTALK) \u00a0", "MACCALLUM: You have to come to it with a way it pay for it.", "FOWLER: You have it right here.", "DUFFY: Richard, remember, there was this $800 billion spending bill under Barack Obama, and they said there were shovel-ready jobs and there weren't no shovel-ready jobs.", "(CROSSTALK) \u00a0FOWLER: That's not true, congressman.", "DUFFY: You've got nothing.", "(CROSSTALK)", "MACCALLUM: Quickly, before we go because I'm pretty much out of time, you know, what's the best way to pay for it, quickly?", "DUFFY: Repatriate profits up from overseas. Best way -- but we're going to do heath care, we're going to do the border, a lot of issues that Americans have bought into. This is one issue that we'll get too.", "FOWLER: Big battle with Trump and the party, Martha. Big battle.", "MACCALLUM: You know what I would say? Actions speak louder than words. \u00a0So we'll see what happens. And if he makes good on those promises, and then he will make good on them.", "FOWLER: I hope so, Martha. I hope he does.", "MACCALLUM: OK. Richard, thank you very much.", "FOWLER: Thank you, Martha.", "MACCALLUM: Sean Duffy, great to see you both.", "So there's a controversy brewing in Ohio, as the state is on the verge of adopting one of the most strict abortion laws that would exist in this country. Lisa Booth and Nomiki Konst will discuss it. It is called the heart beat bill, coming up. Plus, today, we remember the day that lives in infamy. It has been 75 years since the attack on Pearl Harbor, our interviews with heroes who survived coming up. You don't want to miss it, very special.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0", "UNINDENTIFIED MALE: The fact I was setting up machine guns, second time I was firing at enemy planes passing by, and survived that day.", "(END VIDEO CLIP)", "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight at this hour, the state of Ohio is now just a signature away from a historical prolife legislation. Governor John Kasich is now tasked with considering the adoption of one of the strictest abortion laws in the country. It is a measure that would ban abortions upon the first heart beats of the fetus, heart beats that are often measured in just six weeks into a woman's pregnancy. Fox's Shannon Bream has the details on this story for us tonight from Washington. Shannon?", "SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS: Martha, advocates on both sides of the abortion debate are watching and waiting to see what Ohio governor and one time presidential candidate John Kasich will do with the so-called heart beat bill, just passed by lawmakers there. The bill bans anyone from performing an abortion without first checking for a fetal heartbeat, or from continuing with an abortion if a heartbeat is detected. Roughly around six weeks into a pregnancy. A doctor who breaks the law could be convicted of a felony and face up to a year in prison. The bill contains an exception if the mother's life is in danger, but there are no exceptions in cases of rape or incest. Meanwhile, Pro-choice Ohio's executive director says, quote, one in three women choose to have an abortion in their lifetime, making women from getting a medical procedure is out of touch with Ohio values and is completely unacceptable. She continues, clearly this bill's supporters are hoping that President-elect Trump will have the chance to pack the U.S. Supreme Court with justices that are poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. We must prevent that from happening to protect women's lives.", "So far, no word from the governor, although, pro-life, Kasich had express concerns about the legal viability of earlier version of the bill. Similar laws have been struck down in Arkansas and North Dakota, and now the clock is ticking in Ohio. If Kasich signs the bill or does nothing within ten days, it will become law early in 2017. If he veto the measure, that is the end. And last 3/5 of the state house and senate vote to override his veto. Multiple groups including ACLU have vowed to immediately sue if the law does go into effect. Martha?", "MACCALLUM: Our thanks to Shannon Bream. So, here with more, Lisa Booth is a Washington Examiner columnist and a Fox News contributor. Nomiki Konst is host of The Filter on Sirius XM Progress. Welcome to both of you. Good to have you here tonight.", "UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi, Martha.", "MACCALLUM: A lot of pressure right now on John Kasich. This bill is sitting on his desk, and obviously a lot of pro-life advocates would like to see him sign it. But as Shannon pointed out in the past, Kasich has said that he's pro-life, but he believes in exceptions for rape and insist which do not exist in this bill. Nomiki, what do you think happens here? \u00a0What do you think should happen?", "NOMIKI KONST, THE FILTER HOST: Well, number one, I think that this bill is just flat-out unconstitutional. Similar bills have been struck down in upper courts in North Dakota and Arkansas. I think it will be bad politics for John Kasich. I think it's bad politics for Donald Trump. Donald Trump has a lot of things on his desk right now. He needs easy wins. This is a way to unify the left. Unify moderate Republicans who know that this is bad politics. And furthermore, it's just dangerous. Most women don't know they're pregnant by five or six weeks. Most women -- it doesn't stop abortions. It forces a woman to get an abortion in dangerous place and we know that. I mean, there's history to prove that. So, you know, if abortion-right activists are unified in an effort like this, I think that they have a clear path to victory. And I think John Kasich's history shows that he's even against bills like this, which do not exclude women who have experienced rape or incest.", "MACCALLUM: All right, Lisa, what do you think?", "LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, look, I don't think it's as controversial as the media and the left purports it to be. Columbus dispatch and Quinnipiac did polling in 2013, and found that voters were actually split 46/47 on it. So it's not as controversial as, you know, Nomiki just purported to be. But, you will agree with her notion in a sense that North Dakota did have similar legislation that was struck down on Federal court, and the Supreme Court refused the state appeal to hear it, so, ultimately, will likely meet the same fate. But I think what is important here is the movement on the pro- life community, and feeling emboldened under President-elect Donald Trump. If you look at what's happening across the street, there is more pro-life legislation pass in the state level in recent time, and they're only going to get emboldened when Republicans hold more state legislators than ever before in history. And majority of governors in the country are Republicans. And you've also have a president-elect who is committed to things like nominating pro-life Supreme Court justices. Also another important thing, real quick, Martha, is the fact that there is another bill on Governor John Kasich's desk, which he will sign which will make Ohio the 18th state to support banning abortions at 20 weeks, which is something the majority of Americans support. And something that Hillary Clinton did not support. She wants abortions at 20 weeks, which is extreme.", "MACCALLUM: Yeah. Forty three states have some or all abortions after a certain point illegal. And as you point out, that other law would make Ohio the 20th state in terms of the 20-week law. And, you know, we look across the numbers Nomiki, 47 percent of the country according to gallop is pro-choice, 46percent is pro-life. I think these numbers have been changing over the course of the last several years, especially with new technology that does show things like a heartbeat at such an early stage of the game. I would expect that given President Trump's stance that he will -- President-elect Trump that he will pick pro-life judges. And this is something that we're to hear a lot more about.", "KONST: Well, -- did a recent report and showed that 57 percent of Americans believe in some form of abortion, legal or outright completely banned -- being pro-choice.", "MACCALLUM: We've got to go.

We're at Giorgio's family restaurant in Mont Clair. We are joined by a special local panel to talk about the issues that are important here in this swing county inside a swing state, really the Commonwealth of Virginia. We welcome Bob Lewis with the Associated Press, Julian Walker, The Virginian Pilot, David Sherfinski with the Washington Times. Gentlemen, thanks for being here.\u00a0", "This place has a lot of different factors, different demographics. Bob, why is this a swing county?\u00a0", "BOB LEWIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, it's got a -- it's just a diverse population. It swings one way in federal elections and it swings another in state and local elections. Most of the elected officials on the state level are Republican from here. Not just Republican, but very Republican. They include Bob Marshall, a delegate who is among the most outspoken anti-abortion, anti-gay rights members of the legislature. He is the guy who introduced the personhood bill in the general assembly this year.\u00a0", "But in federal elections, in 2006 Prince William went for Jim Webb. And two years later, with the whole country having a backlash against Bush, they went to President Obama. So you have a crucible here that, I think is sort of a bellwether for which way Virginia's going to go.\u00a0", "BAIER: Julian, in a lot of places the economy drives the day, I'm sure that's the case here. What other issues do you think are really important?\u00a0", "JULIAN WALKER, VIRGINIAN PILOT NEWSPAPER: Well one of the ones in Prince William, in this swing county, is immigration, where this county in fact several years ago had a local ordinance which essentially became kind of a model for the law that Arizona passed in order to allow local law enforcement to check the immigration status \u2013 the lawful presence or lack thereof -- of folks who were stopped in this county, detained by law enforcement for one reason or another. That became a very hot issue several years ago. In fact one of the candidates for statewide office next year, for lieutenant governor, Corey Stewart, who is now on the local board of supervisors here, he was kind of the architect behind that, the spearhead of that effort. And so here in Prince William County particularly that is an issue that is a hot button one.\u00a0", "BAIER: Do you agree?\u00a0", "DAVID SHERFINSKI, WASHINGTON TIMES: Absolutely, especially in the wake of the attention that immigration has gotten at the U.S. Supreme Court.\u00a0", "The issue has kind of been under the radar, I would say, over the past five years since the flash point of 2007 when the ordinance was first passed. But with Corey Stewart running for statewide office it definitely will be in play with both sides battling for the Hispanic vote.\u00a0", "BAIER: It's interesting that there are a lot of federal workers in this area, it's a bit further from Washington D.C.", "(CROSSTALK)", "BAIER: But there's a lot of commuters. So how does the cutting back on the federal government play with people in this place?\u00a0", "LEWIS: Well, if the federal government finally does actually cut back. But what you've got here are people who -- there is more private industry here, there's more private sector going on here than people realize. It's not just federally dependent and it's not as federally dependent as Fairfax County just to the north. I think there is a better balance here than there is up north. I think what you have got here is a stronger conservative base. And it leavens itself out when you consider the private sector growth and employment base here versus the federal workforce that's in Prince William County.\u00a0", "BAIER: When the Obama campaign though looks at this county, Julian, they probably look to 2008 where he carried it with 58 percent of the vote. What do you think they're going to be focusing on? You mentioned immigration, and obviously that will be a factor, but what other plays do you think they'll make here?\u00a0", "WALKER: Well, I think you mentioned it. I think the economy is one. Everybody, this is a kitchen table pocketbook election. People feel anxious now. They want to feel better, they want to feel encouraged that things are getting better. And that's the salesman job that he has to try to accomplish. So that's one thing.\u00a0", "Another thing that's big in Virginia is energy. Gas prices at the pump the thing that you see every day when you fill up your vehicle. But beyond that, we've got in Hampton Roads we've got a big ongoing debate about whether or not we should explore offshore for oil and natural gas. In the Southwestern part of the state you've got the coal industry, which is a big bedrock of this state and its economy. In the central part of the state, you've got the looming debate over whether or not to allow uranium mining. There has been a 30-year moratorium in Virginia on that. And so both the economy and I would say energy are the kind of key kitchen table issues that you're will see play out in this election.\u00a0", "BAIER: David, do you sense that this is kind of developing to be a center point for both ads and time for the candidates to spend?\u00a0", "SHERFINSKI: Oh absolutely, I mean, especially with a high stakes U.S. senate election between Tim Kaine and George Allen already reserving millions of dollars in air time in the costly Washington D.C. suburbs, this is -- this along with the Richmond area and the Hampton Roads areas, what's known as kind of the \"urban crescent\" or the \"golden crescent\" in Virginia where there are just so many voters to be had by each side.\u00a0", "BAIER: But yet unemployment is very low here, 4.7 percent. So I mean, obvious the economy drives the day, but overall people are working here.\u00a0", "LEWIS: Yeah. The economy here is good. You have pockets where the economy is not so good. Southside, in rural Virginia, in Martinsville, Pittsylvania County, Henry County, you've got horrible unemployment. Southwest Virginia, the unemployment rates are high, double digit. So the message has to be tailored differently in different places. And where the unemployment rate is high I think President Obama has a higher bar to clear. But David just mentioned, people in Virginia aren't used to an ad war like we're seeing here now already. We were a swing state in '08 but we didn't know it.\u00a0", "BAIER: Right.\u00a0", "LEWIS: And so you didn't see all these ads. And before that, the candidates sort of passed us by and said we know Virginia is going Republican. It has for 44 years --", "BAIER: Right.", "LEWIS: And now you see wall to wall advertising. It's not going to be safe to turn the television on by the time October gets here.\u00a0", "BAIER: It'll be something to watch. Bob, Julian, David, thank you very much for the time. Very interesting.

Jose Reyes-Alfaro, an illegal immigrant originally from El Salvador who was previously held in federal custody awaiting deportation, was charged in that case. It's at least the second time in six months an illegal immigrant with a prior record has been charged in Prince William County in connection with a deadly crime.", "\"You've got this tragic repetition of an illegal immigrant who at one point was in federal custody ... and comes out and commits a serious crime,\" Stewart told FoxNews.com. \"Unquestionably, there are going to be other serious crimes committed by illegal immigrants who we thought were being deported by the federal government.\"", "On Tuesday, the county board endorsed a resolution ordering the county to \"seek all available redress\" from DHS to obtain the information. It also is calling for Congress to request a full investigation into what happened to those 3,000 illegal immigrants that were turned over to ICE.", "The board\u2019s latest move follows a Freedom of Information Act request filed last year to compel DHS to release the information on illegals delivered through the 287(g) program, which authorizes law enforcement officials in the county to check the immigration status of suspects and turn over to federal authorities anybody found to be in the country illegally.", "Stewart said despite the supposed partnership, county police tell him \"anecdotally\" that they're seeing the same illegal immigrants back on the streets after handing them over to federal immigration officials.", "In the case of Reyes-Alfaro, a federal immigration judge ordered him deported in 2002 after he was caught by Border Patrol trying to enter the country illegally the year before. However, he was subsequently granted an \"immigration benefit\" allowing him to stay in the country. A DHS spokesman did not say why Reyes-Alfaro was granted that benefit but told FoxNews.com that his status was revoked in 2006, in effect making him an \"at-large immigration fugitive.\"", "Federal authorities did not find him until he was arrested last week. An ICE official said this time he will \"likely be deported.\"", "Particularly concerning to Stewart is the fact that Reyes-Alfaro twice slipped through the fingers of local authorities after his 2002 reprieve. That suspect was arrested in 2004 on a misdemeanor assault charge. He was sentenced to 90 days, but that sentence was suspended.", "Then in 2008, he was arrested for drinking in public and received a fine. Stewart said both arrests occurred before the county had implemented 287(g), so nobody checked his immigration status. Stewart said he's not confident the federal government would have kept him detained even if he had been turned over.", "\"I think it's pretty clear that they would have released him, and that's the information we're trying to get,\" he said. \"Who are they releasing and who are they deporting?\"", "DHS acknowledges that not every illegal immigrant turned over to them will necessarily stay in federal custody. According to the department, while violent criminals are detained on a mandatory basis, those charged with less serious crimes, like drunken driving, are evaluated on a \"case-by-case\" basis.", "As the board deals with the latest case, the county has also filed another request seeking information about Carlos Martinelly-Montano, an illegal immigrant who last August was charged with killing a nun in an alleged drunk-driving crash. The suspect had a prior drunk-driving record, so county officials wanted to know why he hadn't been deported.", "Stewart said the county heard back from the federal government last week. The administration refused to turn over documents pertaining to Montano, he said, and delivered a \"data dump of useless information\" about the other illegal immigrants.

Did Trump get any bounce out of the Republican convention? \u00a0And where is this race now? \u00a0", "MANAFORT: \u00a0Well, we think we're ahead. \u00a0Especially in the battle ground states, which is we care more about than the national numbers -- I mean, you have to -- when you look at what is the result of the convention, frankly, you have to look at the last month, because Trump has been closing the gap between he and Clinton over the last three weeks. \u00a0", "So, part of the convention bump has occurred before the convention. \u00a0We're confident that after the conventions, you're going to see continued growth in our direction, but more importantly, in the states that are going to elect Donald Trump, we've seen them move in and I\u2019m sure we're going to see more. \u00a0",

Clinton because we've expanded the map. \u00a0", "Pennsylvania is in play, Wisconsin is in play, Michigan is in play, Iowa is in play, Connecticut is in play. \u00a0These are states that historically the Democrats lockdown early for the most part and force us to fight on defensive ground with maybe one or two ways to win. \u00a0", "It\u2019s the opposite this year and we're comfortable coming out of our convention, we\u2019re -- again, the CNN polls that over 75 percent who were watching agreed with Donald Trump and thought he could bring about the change. \u00a0We think -- and that message was geared not at just Republicans, but at Democrats and independents too. \u00a0", "We think that it\u2019s going to be a successful result of our convention. \u00a0The convention itself communicated what we wanted, and we think that Democrats are going to have problems keeping their coalition together, because the establishment is trying to abuse the progressives and their party, and they're the ones in chaos. \u00a0Not us. \u00a0", "WALLACE: \u00a0Paul, thank you. \u00a0Thanks for joining us, after a very busy week. \u00a0Always good to talk with you. \u00a0", "MANAFORT: \u00a0Thanks, Chris.

first joint appearance yesterday in Miami. \u00a0It is time now for our Sunday group, Fox News senior political analyst, Brit Hume, Anne Gearan of the Washington Post, syndicated columnist, George Will, and Amy Walter from The Cook Political Report.", "Well, Bret, what do you think of the Clinton/Kaine ticket and what kind of shape is the Clinton camp paying in heading into the convention?", "BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: \u00a0I think the choice was a wise one. \u00a0It accomplishes a couple of things for her. \u00a0It begins the pivot toward the center, the inevitable pivot toward center that candidates to always make if they want to win.", "It also puts before the public someone whom you can look at and say yes, that person could be president, which is important. \u00a0The importance of the vice-presidential pick fades going forward, but for these immediate purposes, I think he feels a bit fine.", "I think the Clinton campaign certainly thinks he is in pretty good shape, which explains the fact that they didn't really trout out the Kaine announcement in such a way as to try to step on Donald Trump's convention bounce, because it seems to be that he didn't or will not get much of a bounce.", "WALLACE: \u00a0Anne, you covered the Clinton campaign. \u00a0I would like to know what you've gotten from your sources and your reporting, why did she pick Kaine over Warren or Cory Booker or all the others?", "ANNE GEARAN, THE WASHINGTON POST: \u00a0She picked Kaine ultimately because she is the most comfortable with him, and he checks every box. \u00a0She didn't feel the need to reach for anything. \u00a0She didn't feel that she needed to reach for a very, very liberal person who would automatically kind of give her something that liberal things she lacks.", "She didn't think she needed to reach for someone with national security credentials that are very different than her own. \u00a0She didn't feel she needed to reach for anybody who had experiences other than her own, or came from a different part of the party.", "And I think that shows her comfort levels, different points, and that she really feels like he could be somebody that anyone could look at, and say yes, I could see that person being president. \u00a0And then she never has to think about it again.", "WALLACE: \u00a0As we discussed with Joel Benenson, there is another big story on the eve of this convention, and that's the leak of thousands of DNC, Democratic National Committee e-mails that seemed to confirm a lot of people\u2019s suspicions that the DNC was working to help Hillary Clinton, at the expense of Bernie Sanders.", "Amy, does this have the potential to disrupt this convention, and what seemed to be a, if not an alliance, a growing comfort between Clinton and Bernie Sanders and their supporters?", "AMY WALTER, \"THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": \u00a0I think, you know, when we came into the RNC, the question was how much disunity is there really, and what started out in Cleveland was some talk about the delegates erupting. \u00a0That didn't happen. \u00a0But there was still some dissension on the floor.", "The disunity continued to build throughout the event, concluding, of course, with Ted Cruz's decision not to endorse, and to get booed off the stage. \u00a0I don't think that is what we'll see here at all.", "And in fact, if the reports are true that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is not going to speak, that's probably a good idea for this convention, for Hillary Clinton. \u00a0You don't want any -- if you're the Clinton campaign, any attention focused on any sort of disunity.", "And I think the other thing, starting tomorrow, you're going to have two people only stage who liberals really do love. \u00a0Bernie Sanders who is going to speak tomorrow night and Michelle Obama. \u00a0That's going to be the focus moving forward, I think the DNC thing will fade away.", "WALLACE: \u00a0Before I bring in George, do you think Debbie Wassermann Schultz keeps her job between now and November or do you think that the Clinton campaign could decide because of the anger and the sense that all of their deepest suspicions were confirmed that they would sacrifice her?", "WALTER: \u00a0I don't know. \u00a0I mean, I think if I've learned anything from this year, it is how little the traditional parties have mattered. \u00a0Bernie Sanders, he didn't win the nomination, but he succeeded in part because not without the party's support, but he showed us he can go around the party support.", "You don't need those big donors and that access that the parties normally give you. \u00a0You don\u2019t need their voter list. \u00a0You can do it all throughout whether it is this device, you can connect with donors that way. \u00a0He proved, really, as did Donald Trump, that the parties have become less significant than ever.", "WALLACE: \u00a0George, we always, I think, assumed that the DNC was working on behalf of Hillary Clinton and to the detriment of Bernie Sanders. \u00a0Is the leak of these e-mails a big deal, or not?", "GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: \u00a0I don't think it will last for very long, but it does complicate her presentation at this convention. \u00a0The kind of people who work for the DNC are political operatives. \u00a0They have political views and they have political careers.", "They have an eye for the main chance, and they probably assumed all along it would be nice to be on the side of the person who will win. \u00a0A person in Hillary Clinton's incarnation who has contacts with all of the apparatus of the Democratic Party. \u00a0So they had a career reason for doing this.", "WALLACE: \u00a0Also, a practical effect, and the Bernie Sanders supporters will be upset, if you're looking to elect a Democratic president, wasn't Hillary Clinton a more likely choice than Bernie Sanders to win in November?", "WILL: \u00a0Absolutely. \u00a0And the fact that she won after a protracted struggle probably helped her in that it made her a better candidate. \u00a0It always does. \u00a0In the sense, I think on the part of the DNC, which I mean, when do we think about the DNC or the RNC for that matter?", "After candidate gets nominated, he often puts or she puts her own person or his own person in there. \u00a0We shouldn't be surprised it happened this time and we shouldn't think about it very much after.", "WALLACE: \u00a0All right, but for the purposes of today, it is a big story. \u00a0Anne, your thoughts?", "GAERAN: \u00a0It is confirmatory for the Sanders supporters that there was to their view, there was a finger on the scale all along, and that clearly, there was a selective leak of e-mails that tends to back that up. \u00a0That is a perception problem.", "It is potentially a problem when Sanders speaks tomorrow night. \u00a0It will -- it gives people who always wanted to have a reason to distrust this process some evidence to back that up.", "WALTER: \u00a0But the good news if you're Hillary Clinton is that the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign are in good standing. \u00a0This is the DNC that is a bigger problem as opposed to it being a fight between the two camps in the way that the Cruz and Trump were about the two individuals.", "WALLACE: \u00a0Chris, this is all kind of a piece with the argument we've had about the super delegates. \u00a0The super delegates represent the party regulars, and there are many more of them as a percentage of the total delegates here than is the case -- let me quickly say, these are people not elected as part of the primary process. \u00a0They're the mayors and governors and party officials, and they get to go in unbound and be for whoever they want to be.", "HUME: \u00a0Exactly right. \u00a0They played an important role in Hillary Clinton's nomination, and they did these super delegates, in that sense, precisely the system was created to do, which is to keep somebody out there where the buses don't run from getting the nomination.", "And it is certainly no surprise when you think about that, that the Democratic Party apparatus itself would be tipping in favor of the person they thought was more likely to win, and also, actually a Democrat, which Bernie Sanders except for using the party to advance his presidential aspirations is not.", "WALLACE: \u00a0We should point out, there was a meeting of the Rules Committee yesterday, they met for hours and hours and hours about the question of maybe there should be fewer super delegates, and more small D democratic in the sense that people -- the delegates on the floor have to be actually voted in by real people, by voters. \u00a0So they decided in their wisdom to appoint a commission.", "WALTER: \u00a0Don't they always.", "HUME: \u00a0But the net result is to reduce the impact of the super delegates, or even the size their presence here. \u00a0That will tell us the super delegates did exactly what the super delegates were intended to do in this election cycle, and therefore, they're being diminished.", "WALTER: \u00a0I hate these rules battles because it is always fighting the last war. \u00a0We have no idea what candidates are going to emerge and what issues are going to emerge four years for now. \u00a0This is fun and everything, but let's wait until we get to the next candidate --", "WILL: \u00a0The Republicans think that perhaps they ought to have more super delegates.", "WALLACE: \u00a0All right, well, we're going to get to the Republicans in a moment. \u00a0We have to take a break here.", "When we come back, it was Donald Trump's time to shine, but from Melania's speech to Ted Cruz's non non-endorsement there were plenty of distractions.", "Plus what, would you like to ask the panel about how this affected Trump's ability to get his message out. \u00a0Just go to Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air.", "Much more from the Democratic National Convention when \"Fox News Sunday\" continues.", "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)", "TRUMP: \u00a0These are the forgotten men and women of our country. \u00a0I am your voice.", "(END

asked you about the Clinton campaign, where is the Trump campaign at the end of its convention and the beginning of this one, did they unify the Republican base, and were they at all successful in reaching out to undecided voters?", "HUME: \u00a0Well, I think that the party is about as unified as it will get with Donald Trump as its nominee. \u00a0And as for outreach to undecided voters and those who may now not be prepared to vote for Trump, I have my doubts, but I think the message, I am your voice, is the right message.", "I thought his speech was basically all that we\u2019ve been hearing him say for all these months now, except louder, and that may play well. \u00a0If I may use an imperfect nightclub analogy, he was not trying to be the friendly greeter, he was trying to be the bouncer.", "And it just may turn out that a bouncer is exactly what a lot of people want. \u00a0That's kind of how he came across.", "WALLACE: \u00a0We ask you for questions for the panel, and we got this on Facebook from Pattie Merz Kenaan. \u00a0With the pummeling that Hillary Clinton received this week by the speakers at the RNC convention, how does the RNC and Trump campaign plan to deal with the artillery that will surely be hurled by the Clinton campaign at the DNC convention next week?", "Amy, how do you answer Pattie because you know that Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama will try to rip Trump's skin off this week.", "WALTER: \u00a0That's right. \u00a0But I do think they're going to spend much more time trying to build up their candidate than trying to focus almost exclusively on Trump. \u00a0Part of the challenge at the RNC was that the one unifying factor because there still is some disunity among Republicans was Hillary Clinton. \u00a0That was an easy way to rally the troops in opposition to her.", "WALLACE: \u00a0I mean, Clinton has engage in --", "WALTER: \u00a0One hundred percent.", "WALLACE: \u00a0-- character assassination of Trump.", "WALTER: \u00a0Absolutely, and that's not going stop.", "WALLACE: \u00a0OK.", "WALTER: \u00a0But I think you're going to see a convention, this is at least what I'm hearing, this one is going to be much more focused on while taking out Trump, focusing on a much brighter, sunnier kind of optimistic message, and one that talks more about Hillary Clinton, while also taking on Donald Trump.", "WALLACE: \u00a0And how do they deal directly with the issue of the big weakness on honesty and trustworthy.", "WALTER: \u00a0That's right. \u00a0I don't know that you'll ever be able to deal with that. \u00a0In fact, I think the reality for so many voters, come November, that won't go away. \u00a0She can't fix that. \u00a0I don\u2019t people won't find her more trustworthy.", "The question is whether they find her good enough to be president, or better choice in terms of doing the job of president. \u00a0They see her as more experienced. \u00a0Do they want that kind of president over Donald Trump?", "WALLACE: \u00a0George, you are to put it gently, not a Trump enthusiast. \u00a0Two questions, did you watch the Republican convention?", "WILL: \u00a0I did.", "WALLACE: \u00a0And secondly, what did you think of it?", "WILL: \u00a0I watched between innings. \u00a0The defining characteristic of the speaker, the nominee himself and the convention itself with the lock her up chance was anger. \u00a0I don\u2019t think the American people have elected an angry president, someone defined by anger, someone who is a (inaudible) anger since Andrew Jackson.", "And that was a 100 years before the invention of television, which brings presidents into our living room more than anyone other than family members. \u00a0I'm not sure the American people want anger in their living room.", "Mrs. Clinton said Kaine is everything that Trump/Pence aren't, he could have said he is cheerful, a happy warrior. \u00a0A phrase applied to Democratic nominee, Al Smith and later to another Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey.", "So the question is, how do they deal with this problem with the perception of Mrs. Clinton? \u00a0I think they're going to fall back on Joe Biden\u2019s wonderful axiom, don't compare me to the all mighty, compare me to the alternative.", "And they are going to say the alternative is Donald Trump and do you want an angry man in your living room?", "WALLACE: \u00a0You say he is angry. \u00a0Trump is pushing back on the idea that his was a grim speech, or that he was angry, they're saying he was strong. \u00a0He was telling it like it is.", "WILL: \u00a0Well, Donald Trump is the one who was described contemporary America as a \"hell hole,\" that's a quote. \u00a0When you describe America as a place for people who are afraid to leave their houses, poverty and terrorism, I think most Americans think we have a wonderful country with serious problems. \u00a0I don't think they think it is a hell hole.", "WALLACE: \u00a0And what do --

capitalize on. \u00a0The darkness in their view of the Trump message, the ways in which Trump seems to be attacking American institutions, and America\u2019s presence in the world, Democrats think they can turn on its head and say, hey, wait a minute. \u00a0We're not failing. \u00a0We're not a failed state. \u00a0That's one message.", "There is concern within Hillary Clinton land that Trump is resonating on a couple of points. \u00a0The law and order and security issues primarily that he is touching something there that is national security, but also, really gets at a number of other areas of unease, social unease, economic unease, fears about safety.", "WALLACE: \u00a0And what about the idea, every election in a sense is a changed election. \u00a0Trump very much was arguing, he has change versus Hillary Clinton status quo. \u00a0He is with the people against the elite.", "GEARAN: \u00a0That's going to be a powerful argument for Trump, just because this would be the third Democratic administration in a row, and it has been Hillary Clinton's bet that it is far better to wrap herself in Barack Obama than to run away from him.", "So in a way, that opens -- Democrats think that that's good for them. \u00a0But it also obviously opens the door for Trump to make the accurate claim that she is basically running for a third term. \u00a0That she is trying to continue the current status quo, and if you don't like the status quo, then he is the change.", "WALLACE: \u00a0Brit.", "HUME: \u00a0The last third term election was in 1988, and one remembers Ronald Reagan at the Democratic Convention saying we are the change. \u00a0Some people, including David Broder of the \"Washington Post\" said he thought that's when he knew this election was going to the Republicans because it rang true.", "Of course, he was also saying in effect that things are going well. \u00a0They were. \u00a0Things in the public's mind at this stage are not going so well. \u00a0As the Democrats seek to portray this as a good idea to elect the Democrats as a third time, they have to be careful not to acknowledge that a lot of people do not think things are going well and they're really not looking for continuity, they're looking for change.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an easy task to defend what has been done, and yet say I'm going to make things different and better at the same time. \u00a0If you're too rosy, people will say these people are out of touch. \u00a0They don't understand.", "WALLACE: \u00a0Right track/wrong track.", "WALTER: \u00a0That\u2019s exactly right.", "WALLACE: \u00a0What about 2/1?", "WALTER: \u00a0Right, this is not 1988 or 2000. \u00a0There is a desire for change, but the question in fronts of voters that I think Hillary Clinton is going to give is change at what cost. \u00a0Is it worth making this change given what it could be? \u00a0And so the alternative, I may not be the best, but I\u2019m better than the alternative, that's the message that I think you're going to see.", "WALLACE: \u00a0Amy, we got less than a minute left. \u00a0The polls say this is tell a close race, in fact it has gotten closer since the FBI and James Comey's scolding of Hillary Clinton. \u00a0Is it still a close race?", "WALTER: \u00a0I think it is a close race and it will continue to be. \u00a0I'm with Joel. \u00a0I'm not going to look at numbers until we get out of this convention, and see what actually happens.", "WILL: \u00a0When the Republicans convene in 1988, Dukakis was 17 points ahead of George Herbert Walker Bush. \u00a0Polls at this point are fluid.", "WALLACE: \u00a0I remember that poll. \u00a0It was a \"Newsweek\" poll and it was a bit of an outlier. \u00a0Bush had the upper hand, and because of the circumstances in the country. \u00a0Not so good today.", "All right, thank you, panel. \u00a0See you next Sunday.", "Up next, a final word as we continue our coverage from the site of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.", "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "WALLACE: \u00a0Another live look here in Philadelphia. \u00a0Now, for this program note. \u00a0Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest from the Democratic National Convention. \u00a0And that's it for today. \u00a0Have a great week. \u00a0We'll see you back in Washington next \"Fox News Sunday.\""]}
