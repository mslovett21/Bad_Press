", "The Virginia and New Jersey governor's races -- a year after every presidential election -- are always seen as a test of how voters perceive the sitting President. This year, Virginia, in particular, looks like a strong gauge of Trump's performance -- and a proving ground for the strategies both parties hope will work in the 2018 midterm elections. ", "Here are five big questions for Tuesday's elections:", "1. Can Trump's tactics sell without Trump? ", "Trump visited his golf course in Virginia 15 times between Gillespie winning the GOP gubernatorial primary and the general election. But he didn't once hold an event with Republican candidate in the most important race of 2017. ", "Gillespie might not have wanted to campaign with Trump -- but he certainly borrowed heavily from Trump's tactics and signature issues. ", "Long known as an advocate for a bigger Republican tent and more inclusive immigration policies, Gillespie has taken an alarmist turn this year. His TV ads have included striking images of MS-13 gangs displaying the words \"kill, rape, control,\" as well as Gillespie pledging to keep Confederate monuments up, and hitting Democrats for automatically restoring the voting rights of former felons who have completed their sentences. ", "Those culture warrior tactics were designed to make sure Trump's base turned out for Gillespie, who nearly lost the Republican primary to Corey Stewart. But they alienated a lot of Gillespie's old friends.  ", "Gillespie spokesman David Abrams refuted those critiques, saying, \"Ed is surging in the polls because Republicans are united behind his campaign, and because he is running on substantive policies broadly popular with the people of Virginia.\" ", "The question is whether Trump voters will buy Gillespie's authenticity and turn out to vote for him -- or if they'll see Gillespie's refusal to be seen near Trump as a better reflection of his allegiances and stay home. ", "2. Can Obama fix Democrats' off-year problems?  ", "Former President Barack Obama oversaw the atrophy of the Democratic Party at the state and local level -- a result of the party's failure to turn out its voters in non-presidential elections that led to losing about 1,000 state legislative seats. Now that he's out of office, Obama is trying to convince Democratic voters that these races really do matter. ", "\"Off-year elections, midterm elections -- Democrats sometimes, y'all get a little sleepy. You get a little complacent,\" Obama said during a rally with Northam in Richmond last month. ", "\"And so as a consequence, folks wake up and they're surprised -- 'How come we can't get things through Congress? How come we can't get things through the state house?' \" Obama said. \"Because you slept through the election.\"", "In particular, Northam's campaign has been laser focused on turning out black voters. Those black voters make up about 20% of Virginia's electorate and tend to vote strongly Democratic. It's why his event with Obama was in Richmond, a city with a sizeable African-American population. ", "And make no mistake, Obama himself could be the most important salesman here. If his involvement in Northam's campaign can boost turnout, Democrats across the 2018 midterm map would see him as a potential game-changer.   ", "3. Will progressive groups' ground troops lead to turnout? ", "Outside groups are playing a big role in Northam's campaign -- supplying digital advertising reinforcements for a candidate who has only aired TV ads as well as ground troops who have made calls and knocked on doors for weeks. ", "Perhaps the leader of those groups is Planned Parenthood, which has a lot on the line -- not just in the governor's race, but for lieutenant governor, where Democrat Justin Fairfax faces Republican Jill Holtzman Vogel. The Republican is known for having sponsored a 2012 bill that would have required women seeking abortions to undergo vaginal ultrasounds -- which Planned Parenthood vehemently opposed. ", "Other Democratic groups have bickered about Virginia since Northam defeated former Rep. Tom Perriello in the gubernatorial primary. That split was on vivid display last week when Democracy For America announced it wouldn't back Northam's \"racist\" campaign while making calls for other Democratic candidates. ", "But a share of the credit for wins in statewide and even state assembly contests would go to Planned Parenthood, which announced in August it would spend $3 million to help Northam. ", "4. Will there be a shocker? ", "The reason so much focus is on Virginia is that Tuesday's other big contests all feature heavy favorites. But close elections have a way of sneaking up on people. ", "In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and US ambassador to Germany, is expected to cruise past Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno. That's in large part because of the Chris Christie factor: The outgoing Republican governor's approval rating is in the teens, making him the least popular governor in America. And while Guadagno has tried to create some distance -- hitting Christie after he was ", "photographed on a closed beach ", "during a state government shutdown -- she's still Christie's No. 2. ", "In New York City, mayor Bill de Blasio campaigned alongside Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and is looking to build his status with progressive voters even outside the city. ", "If any of these contests tighten up, it'd set off alarms across both parties nationally. ", "5.  Can Democrats take full control in Washington state?", "One down-ballot race to watch: a state senate contest in Washington. ", "If Democrat Manka Dhingra defeats Republican Jinyoung Lee Englund, control of the senate would tip into Democratic hands. Democrats already control the state house and governor's office -- which means a win in that race would give them the \"trifecta\": unified control of Washington's government.", "This is incredibly important. Right now, Republicans have that \"trifecta\" in 26 states, which gives them broad authority not just over laws and budgets, but the redistricting process every 10 years. Democrats, though, only have such control in six states -- California, Oregon, Hawaii, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island. It's perhaps the most vivid example of the party's collapse during Obama's tenure, and an imbalance that reflects Democrats' broad structural disadvantages. ", "Full party control matters. In many states where Republicans are in charge, their lawmakers have passed right-to-work laws and voter ID laws, and handle the once-a-decade redistricting process alone. The more those structural advantages are locked in, the harder it is for Democrats to regain what they've lost. "]},

Zooplankton, which get carried by currents, collected in those waters had levels of cesium-137 and the shorter-lived cesium-134 that were on average 40 times higher than the surrounding water, he said.

The samples were taken at points in and around the Kuroshio Current, the Pacific version of the Gulf Stream, and involve surface water, not the coastal sediments where a portion of contaminants are likely to have settled. ", "\"There's a lot of key missing information about the sediments,\" he said. ", "Cesium-137 has a radioactive half-life of 30 years, while cesium-134 loses half its radioactivity after two. Fisher said concentrations of the isotope might undergo a \"moderate buildup\" in marine life higher up the food chain, but it's not likely to concentrate as much as some dangerous industrial toxins like mercury.

But Sembler hasn't given -- he \"absolutely\" would if asked, though.", "\"Who is he again?\" asked media mogul Stan Hubbard, a Crossroads giver who said he deals mostly with former Bush aide Karl Rove, not Gillespie.", "Gillespie may be discovering that just because Republican donors have funded Crossroads, it does not mean that they will fund him personally.", "\"Ed's relationship is with more the staff, princples and leadership with Crossroads -- and not neccssarily with the rank-and-file-donors,\" said one person close to the group, granted anonymity to candidly assess the relationship.", "Gillespie's intimates and multiple people close to Crossroads concede that his ties to the organization have long withered, Immediately after the Citizens United decision upended politics in 2010, Gillespie worked hand-in-glove with Rove to launch a batter of Republican fundraising operations that could allow the GOP to capitalize on the erasure of contribution limits.", "Since then, however, Gillespie's role has drastically diminished at Crossroads, according to multiple people familiar with the inner workings. Much of the Rove's political operation at Crossroads has been subsumed by that of Mitch McConnell, who has blessed the Crossroads network and launched a new partner organization, Senate Leadership Fund, that gobbled up much of the establishment Republican money in the 2016 race. After McConnell's team held the Senate against tough odds, some predict Rove's role could weaken even more.", "Nevertheless the donor network that Gillespie built at Crossroads is largely absent from his current run, according to an analysis of Virginia campaign finance disclosures. Donors to Crossroads -- such as Home Depot founder Bernie Marcus or new Trump Cabinet members Linda McMahon and Betsy DeVos -- are responsible for just over $350,000 to Gillespie's gubernatorial political operation, $100,000 of which came solely from the DeVos family.", "One longtime Crossroads donor, St. Louis billionaire Rex Sinquefeld, met with Gillespie twice since he announced his run for governor, according to Sinquefeld aide Travis Brown, and Sinquefeld admired his commitment to cutting taxes. But Gillespie failed to draw a check out of him, according to campaign finance records.", "Yet several senior Republicans close to Gillespie and Crossroads predict that the network's donors will eventually come around, arguing that prominent conservative givers won't tolerate a loss in the high-profile off-year election. And for now, sources concede, it's better politics to focus on Virginia givers -- not high-wattage GOP billionaires, who are almost all from out of state.", "\"After talking to a number of Crossroads donors,\" said the senior group fundraiser, \"I'm confident many are in his corner.\""]},

The next day, Nunes held a news conference and went to the White House to brief the President, a move that set off a firestorm from Democrats, prompting Schiff to call for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. ", "Nunes initially refused, but the pressure on him mounted as more details emerged about how he had received the information from two officials at the White House. Just over two weeks later, amid a new House Ethics Committee probe into whether he had revealed classified information while discussing the intercepts, Nunes stepped aside and put Conaway in charge, along with by Reps. Tom Rooney of Florida and Trey Gowdy of South Carolina.", "For a time, there was a \"burst of cooperation\" between Conaway and Schiff after the Texas Republican took over, according to sources from both parties.", "But the scar tissue on the committee over the Nunes episode hadn't disappeared, and the episode left both sides deeply untrusting of the other. ", "Some Republicans believed committee Democrats were complicit in the use of an underhanded tactic to force Nunes aside, after liberal advocacy groups filed the complaint that prompted the Ethics Committee investigation, which ultimately cleared Nunes in December.", "\"The fact that an ethics complaint was filed against him was crossing a line,\" said a Republican close to the committee. \"It was irreconcilable as to how the parties would work together where one views they're on a political revenge march versus an investigation. ... Not one Democrat on the committee willing to say this was destructive, this was baseless.\" ", "But to Democrats, ", "Nunes' secret trip to the White House ", "had only proven their worst suspicions that point of the investigation was to clear the President.", "\"It's hard to argue he hadn't pre-planned this would make some effort to show that they were trying to find out what happened, but to make sure it was guarded at all times,\" said Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat.  \"This was a designed failure. It was designed to tank, and most importantly protect the President politically and legally. And it succeeded in their efforts.\"", "Nunes steps aside, sort of", "While Nunes publicly had stepped aside from the probe in April 2017, he remained involved in quiet ways.", "Democrats were surprised to learn Nunes retained subpoena power for the Russia investigation, and they say Nunes frequently blocked their efforts to issue subpoenas or call witnesses, although Conaway says he received any subpoena he has asked for from Nunes.", "And Nunes had subpoenas of his own, too. ", "When the committee issued its first Russia-related subpoenas, for instance, to former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen, Nunes at the same time also subpoenaed former Obama administration officials over \"unmasking,\" or revealing the identities of Americans who were communicating with foreign officials under surveillance by the US intelligence community. ", "Subpoenas would continue to be a sore spot in the investigation, particularly when Lewandowski, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified earlier this year and would not discuss events after Trump was in the White House. Last month, Schiff released a list of nearly three dozen people and entities he thought should have been subpoenaed in the investigation.", "Nunes would continue to loom over the Russia investigation in other ways. ", "Two of his aides took a trip in the summer to London in an attempt to find Christopher Steele, the former British spy who compiled a dossier of allegations of Trump ties to Russia, without alerting Democrats or even Conaway, although committee officials have said the staffers were only looking to contact Steele's attorney, not Steele himself.", "Conaway has downplayed the trip's significance, saying the staffers were already in London on other committee business. But one committee source told CNN that the trip occurred as there were early discussions underway about having Conaway and Schiff try to go speak to Steele together.", "Nunes was also working on his own investigation in parallel to the Russia probe, an effort focused on the Steele dossier. His committee went to court to enforce a subpoena obtaining the bank records of Fusion GPS, the firm that paid Steele, and he threatened to hold senior Justice Department and FBI officials in contempt over documents related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.", "Nunes' efforts culminated in the memo he released in January accusing the FBI of abusing the surveillance process with the warrant on Page. The Nunes memo sparked a counter-memo from Democrats and threw the committee into a month-long feud that was arguably its most-heated partisan fight.", "A spokesman for Nunes declined to comment. ", "Fights in public and private", "The reality was the partisan brawling sparked by the memos was a product of months of tension bubbling under the surface.", "During last summer as the committee investigation marched on, Schiff and Conaway held weekly meetings about the investigation. But as summer turned to fall, the meetings became less frequent and then stopped happening at all, according to a committee source.", "At the same time, the pace of the witness interviews accelerated, often with multiple interviews in a single day in November and December. Witnesses, at times, would meet with the panel before members had a chance to review any records that were submitted to the committee, which Democrats said impaired their ability to ask relevant questions.", "The quickened schedule prompted Democratic predictions that Republicans were trying to shut down the investigation soon after the calendar turned to 2018, while Republicans began accusing Democrats of trying to stretch out the investigation into the midterm campaign season. ", "Many Republicans on the committee grew agitated with the frequent television appearances of Schiff and other committee Democrats. Several Republicans suggested Schiff was using the committee to position himself for a potential Senate run had Sen. Dianne Feinstein retired (she has since said she'll run for re-election).", "Schiff disputed that contention, pointing to the frequent television appearances by Gowdy.", "\"What bothered them was that we were exposing their malfeasance,\" Schiff said of Republicans.", "Republicans also accused their Democratic counterparts of leaking committee testimony and documents to drive anti-Trump stories. The committee's Republicans even tallied the list of leaks they said had originated from Democrats, a statistic that was included in materials the committee and Speaker Paul Ryan's office used to defend the investigation. ", "But the leak accusations came from both sides: Donald Trump Jr.'s attorney alleged that Democrats were leaking testimony in the middle of his client's hearing, while Nunes and committee Republicans were accused of leaking witness testimony to Cohen's attorney, as well as the text messages of Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.", "The partisan accusations didn't stop when the committee interviewed witnesses in closed settings either.", "One Republican close to the panel said that during witness interviews, \"Schiff and his team could not stop attacking their Republican counterparts.\"", "Democrats, meanwhile, said Republicans asked merely superficial questions \u2014 simply asking Trump officials if they had colluded cooperated or coordinated with Russians \u2014 and tried to protect witnesses like Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.", "And now Democrats are pushing for the release of the transcripts, something Conaway once said he was open to but has since backed away from.", "\"They are now doing a complete about-face and have flip-flopped on this,\" Schiff said. ", "Is this the end?", "Last month, the committee's Republicans announced they had concluded their investigation and had a 150-page report with the panel's findings, a number that ballooned by roughly 100 pages by the time the committee voted out the report the following week, according to Conaway.", "The report, which hasn't been made public yet, found no evidence of collusion, a conclusion that Republicans have stood by but Democrats say was engineered from the start.", "\"We set out with four goals that we hope to accomplish with the committee, and by and large we accomplished those goals,\" Stewart said. \"The committee has had a breakdown in bipartisanship, but I don't think that entirely stopped us from doing the work we need to do.\"", "But the Russia fight doesn't appear over. Democrats are preparing a separate report from Republicans, and they're also starting their own Russia investigation with witnesses willing to come forward, like former Cambridge Analytica contractor Christopher Wylie.", "And Nunes' investigation into the dossier is continuing, too, with a probe of the State Department, as he tries to determine who else in the Obama administration was aware of the Steele dossier.", "\"The Republicans haven't stopped the investigation,\" Schiff said. \"It's just the Russia piece they don't want to do anymore.\"", "This story has been updated to include additional comment from former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.", "CNN's Sara Murray contributed to this report."]},

In both the Democratic and Republican races, an urban-rural divide defined the outcome of those contests.", "While these races have a tendency to hinge on local issues, Virginia is a key battleground during presidential and midterm election years. It's the first such state primary in a battleground since 2016, when President Donald Trump lost Virginia and Hillary Clinton carried the state's major metropolitan areas and their suburbs, particularly those outside of Washington, DC and Richmond.", "The Republicans", "Ed Gillespie, the former lobbyist and Republican National Committee chairman, parlayed his establishment connections and a strong showing in an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 2014 into a narrow 44%-43% GOP primary victory over Prince William County Board of Supervisors chairman Corey Stewart. Veteran GOP state Senator Frank Wagner of Virginia Beach finished a distant third with 14%, based on complete but unofficial returns. Gillespie owes his 4,300-vote statewide margin of victory to his strength in the close-in suburbs of Washington, DC, and Richmond, the state capital. ", "In Fairfax County, the largest vote-producer in the primary just outside of Washington, Gillespie defeated Stewart, 48%-39%. Along with his two-to-one advantage over Stewart in nearby Arlington and Alexandria, Gillespie garnered roughly 7,700 votes more than Stewart in these areas.", "Stewart, who aligned himself closely with the views of Trump, ran well on his home turf, the more working-class Washington exurbs of Prince William, defeating Gillespie 60%-32%. Gillespie narrowly prevailed in the more upscale and better-educated exurbs of Loudoun County, 45%-43%. But in the rest of the exurbs beyond the Washington Beltway, Stewart won a plurality of the votes.", "Gillespie captured nearly 60% of the Republican primary votes cast in Richmond and its suburbs of Henrico County. He also narrowly carried the Hampton Roads region, Virginia's other main urban center, which includes Chesapeake, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach, winning just over a third of the votes cast there. Had Wagner not been on the ballot, Gillespie likely would have increased his margins in this area as well. Outside of Lynchburg and the Roanoke metro area, Stewart won wide swaths of the central and western Virginia rural communities, and nearly engineered an upset that few observers gave him much of a chance to pull off.", "The Democrats", "Virginia's \"urban crescent,\" also played a critical role in the Democratic primary, where Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam handily defeated former Rep. Tom Perriello, 56%-44%. Northam, who had wide backing from the state's Democratic Party establishment, trounced Perriello in Virginia's Hampton Roads region. He won roughly seven-out-of-10 votes in this area that is next door to the state Senate district he once held. Northam also swept Richmond as well as its suburbs and exurbs. ", "Perriello carried the 5th Congressional District in central Virginia, which he represented for one term ending in 2011, except for the portions that stretched into the Washington, DC, exurbs of Fauquier and Rappahannock Counties. He also won most of the rural counties in the Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenandoah Valley on the western rim of the state save for half a dozen counties in its southwestern corner, where coal production peaked 20 years ago. Perriello's staunch opposition to a proposed natural gas pipeline just north of the coal region may have hurt him among voters whose communities and culture are tied to fossil fuels.", "But Perriello, who had moved to Arlington in Northern Virginia after his defeat in the 2010 midterm elections, was unable to gain much traction in the Washington suburbs and exurbs, where a strong performance is essential for Democratic candidates. Perriello fought Northam to almost a draw in both Loudoun and Prince William Counties, but in wealthy and increasingly diverse Fairfax County, where almost one-out-of-six of the Democratic primary votes were cast; Northam defeated Perriello 60%-40%. Likewise, he beat Perriello by three-to-two margins in the Democratic bastions of Alexandria and Arlington.", "While Perriello's television advertising featured footage of President Barack Obama touting him in the 2010 midterm elections, Northam ran very strong in urban areas where African-American voters account for a large proportion of the electorate like Hampton, Norfolk, Petersburg and Portsmouth. Northam also swept rural counties with majority black populations like Brunswick, Charles City, Greensville and Sussex. In all of these jurisdictions, Northam won more than 70% of the vote.", "Higher turnout for Democrats", "Roughly 542,000 ballots were cast in the Democratic primary and the GOP contest tallied some 366,000 votes. Virginia has almost 5.5 million registered voters, so the combined turnout was almost 17%. This is the first time since 1949 that both parties have conducted a primary for the same gubernatorial election, so turnout comparisons are difficult to make. In 2009, the last time the Democrats held a contested gubernatorial primary, just over 319,000 votes were cast. In 2005, Republicans held a noncompetitive primary for governor and some 175,000 ballots were tallied. In the 2013 gubernatorial general election, roughly 43% of the state's registered voters went to the polls."]},

So we've got our work cut out for us,\" Rounds said upon leaving the morning bipartisan meeting.

Experts have estimated that cutting these categories would reduce the roughly 1 million green cards given out yearly by 25% to 50%. ", "At first, the Trump proposal would use the green cards from the eliminated categories -- plus the 50,000 from the eliminated diversity visa lottery -- to work through a backlog of millions of people waiting in a line upward of 30 years long for their green cards. The bill does extend an olive branch to the left in not making the cuts retroactive -- meaning anyone already in line would still be eligible. Groups on the right are outraged that the plan would mean potentially 10 to 20 years before cuts to immigration begin. ", "But Democrats are unlikely to accept such a sweeping cut in legal immigration at all. And cutting the diversity visa lottery is not as straightforward as some believe -- especially to members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other affinity caucuses, who are ", "vocal about the importance of immigration from lesser represented countries", ". ", "And the framework includes vague references to closing \"legal loopholes,\" as a White House official put it on a briefing call, as part of the border security pillar -- perhaps one of the biggest poison pills of the deal. ", "The White House released only a top-line overview of what it was seeking -- what it characterized as \"closing the loopholes\" to more easily detain and deport immigrants. But a document obtained by CNN that goes into more detail, which the Department of Homeland Security has been providing to lawmakers in meetings, and the descriptions released by the White House suggest it will pursue aggressive changes.", "In addressing \"catch-and-release,\" as the White House put it, the framework could allow detaining individuals indefinitely as they await deportation for months and years -- something that has been curtailed as the result of constitutional concerns from courts. The proposals could also vastly expand the definitions of criminal offenses that could subject an individual to deportation. ", "All the efforts to more aggressively deport and reject undocumented immigrants could be anathema to Democrats and some moderate Republicans.

But just outside the Senate chamber, Republican leadership ", "told reporters that the debate would get only a week", " of floor time -- a move to pressure Democrats to produce their legislative proposals. ", "Democrats and some Republicans had anticipated possible weeks of debate -- and little legislation has been finalized and introduced on either side yet that would deal with DACA, a program that protected young undocumented immigrants from deportation that President Donald Trump is ending, and any other provisions on immigration. ", "Instead of then moving straight into a vote to open debate, the Senate spent Tuesday arguing about next steps, with Democrats accusing Republicans of tampering with the procedure and Republicans accusing Democrats of dilatory tactics because they had nothing to offer. ", "The finger pointing spilled onto the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon, when McConnell moved to consider an amendment that would have dealt with sanctuary cities -- a favorite target of Republicans. ", "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York objected, asking instead that the body move to consider ", "a bill largely resembling the White House proposal ", "-- a pathway to citizenship for DACA eligible immigrants, a hefty border security request, substantially curtailing family-based migration and ending the diversity visa lottery -- in conjunction with ", "a proposal from Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware", " that would pair DACA with a comprehensive review of border security.  ", "Schumer noted that neither would likely succeed -- but would at least kick things off. And he noted that only one had been drafted and officially introduced -- the McCain-Coons bill -- saying the Senate could vote as soon as the Republican proposal was written. Some Democrats also privately suspected Republicans were hesitating to have the White House proposal go first, only to be defeated immediately, and were seeking to delay. ", "\"That (pairing) will tell us, sort of, the bounds,\" Schumer told reporters at a news conference later. \"I don't think either of them will get large bipartisan support. But it will give us an idea of the parameters and can set us moving. ... Now, if these proposals fail, the body will continue to work its bipartisan will for a bill that can pass.\"", "Republicans, meanwhile, mocked Democrats for not being ready in time and trying to avoid votes that could be difficult for vulnerable members of their party. ", "\"It's an open process, right?\" said GOP leadership member Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. \"So if our leader wants to call that (sanctuary cities) amendment up, I mean, eventually we'll get to (the White House framework), but there are others we want to process as well, but I'm not sure why you would block even moving to the initial consideration of amendments, which is what the Democrats are currently doing. That makes no sense if you're the ones who have been advocating now for literally weeks that we need to get on an immigration bill.\"", "Calm exterior but negotiations continue ", "Democrats did not telegraph any concern about the timeline, even as the day slipped away. They called a Thursday deadline \"arbitrary,\" in the words of Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, and held their fire on GOP leadership. ", "\"Negotiations continue,\" Durbin said. \"The timetable is dependent on the rules of the Senate and unanimous consent requests. ... I hope we can finish it this week.\"", "\"The sooner, the better,\" Schumer said at a news conference after party lunches. \"But right now, our focus is getting to 60. That's going to take a lot of push and pull. A lot of compromise.\"", "The calmness, though, belied furious negotiations behind the scenes. ", "As Democrats were locked away in their closed-door lunch, intense conversations among key players spilled outside into the view of reporters. ", "At the top of the caucus meeting, Durbin and Schumer huddled for a few minutes with two aides on the steps just outside, where press is not allowed, an unusual occurrence. Not long after going inside, Schumer came out again and huddled with just the staff, which included top Durbin counsel Joseph Zogby, a regular attendee at immigration meetings. After Schumer returned to his meeting, the staff continued to meet just outside. ", "Democrats were tight-lipped coming out of the meeting -- Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland confirmed they were going over proposals on immigration and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said they were \"making progress,\" but all refused to go into further detail.", "A group of bipartisan senators also continued to work furiously behind-the-scenes, exchanging drafts of possibilities and working to find a fit that would get 60 votes.

The bipartisan gathering place had a fair number of Republicans and Democrats in it as Coons spoke to those around the room, the source said.  ", "Of course, in the Senate, things could come together very quickly -- or not at all. In the meantime, everyone was waiting to see what happened next.

", "1) Brazile faces blowback from Clinton allies, but stands by blockbuster book account of 2016 debacle", "                Donna Brazile is a rare breed in American politics: a one-time Jesse Jackson insurgent who became an important member of the Democratic Party's national leadership, often playing big roles in bridging differences between competing factions.", "                Now, she faces criticism that she is stoking a divide at the worst possible moment -- as Democrats try to win key elections this week and deal with the broader challenge of choosing a course, and a message, heading into 2018 and beyond.", "                At issue is Brazile's new book, a personal memoir that includes some blockbuster stuff: her view that the Clinton campaign had too much influence over the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential primaries, complaints she was mistreated after she became interim party chairwoman for the back half of 2016, and an eye-popping account of how Brazile says she considered using her power as chairwoman to try to replace Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, with Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Cory Booker.", "                People who have called Brazile a friend for 30 years or more are furious. Some say she twists facts in her book. Others say she is being disloyal by spilling in public things best kept private. Even some Brazile allies say the timing is horrible because Democrats need big turnout in Virginia and elsewhere this week and cannot afford bad blood or distractions.", "                Brazile acknowledges fierce blowback but says she is at peace with her decision.", "                \"Read the book. Make your own conclusion,\" she said in one exchange in recent days, responding to complaints from Clinton staffers who challenge her account of a campaign Brazile says lacked passion and often lied to her. She said her in-box was helping her \"define real love versus sour grapes.\"", "                So does this longtime inside player worry about being cast now as disloyal and destructive?", "                This in an email to CNN: \"After what the country went through, I'm not afraid.\" ", "Then this on ABC on Sunday, to her critics:  \"Go to hell. I'm going to tell my story.\"", "2) It's election day on Tuesday -- and Maine may send a message", "                Most of the national attention on this week's Election Day is focused on the Virginia governor's race.", "                That's understandable: The race is close and Virginia is considered a national bellwether. It's a big statewide contest and a big test of the \"Trump effect\" one year after the 2016 vote and as the parties gear up for the 2018 midterms.", "                But CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson says keep an eye on Maine, too, because its voters will be weighing in on an issue that factors big-time in the national debate over Obamacare.", "\"People should pay attention to Maine, a referendum on the ballot there on whether or not to expand Medicaid. Gov. Paul LePage has vetoed that attempt by the Legislature to expand Medicaid five times. He says it's too expensive. He likens it to welfare,\" Henderson explains.  \"Proponents of expanding Medicaid say it will help rural hospitals, it will help rural residents, it would bring jobs. ... Two states probably looking at this in particular: activists in Utah and Idaho also trying to put expanding medicaid on the ballot in 2018.\"", "3) A December DACA Deal? A White House meeting to set strategy", "                President Trump says he wants to cut a deal with Congress to protect the so called Dreamers, younger undocumented workers who were brought into the United States when they were too young to understand they were committing an illegal act. And as the clock ticks down on 2017, one way to get that done would be to add legislative language to the year-end spending bill Congress needs to pass to keep the government open.", "                But that prospect worries a lot of conservatives, who want the issue treated separately so they can maximize their leverage in seeking conservative immigration changes in exchange for any so-called DACA fix.", "                Michael Shear of The New York Times shared reporting on a White House meeting this past week in which President Trump agreed the issue should not be tacked onto the year-end spending plan.", "                But that doesn't completely close the book on that idea.", "\"I talked to a very senior Democratic senator last week who said he thinks that's largely posturing,\" Shear says. \"And, [the source says] there's still a possibility that the President, who has expressed some interest in doing something for these kids, and the two parties in Congress might still be able to work something out at the end of the year.\"", "4) No big legislative wins -- but some important Trump legacy gains in the Senate", "                It is a fact that more than nine months after taking office, President Trump has no major big-ticket legislative victories.", "                But it is also a fact that one important Trump legacy test is advancing in a major way.", "                Just this past week: Four Trump nominees to serve as federal appeals court judges were confirmed by the Senate, the latest step in a Trump judicial makeover that is a major rallying cry for conservatives.", "                CNN's Phil Mattingly reports it is also a way for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to rebut conservative criticism of his performance.", "\"They slammed through four circuit court judges in a single week. That brings it to eight they have done so far,\" Mattingly reports. \"There are still two dozen other openings waiting for them. And next week they also have several agency-level, very prominent, very kind of complicated nominations that they're going to push through. ... If you want a conservative imprint to last, not just for a couple of  years, but for decades, they failed on the legislative side, at least so far. On the side of personnel, [Republicans] are doing pretty well.\"", "5) Sen. Rand Paul assaulted at home -- a  reminder of rising security concerns", "                One of the weekend's more startling headlines was news of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul being assaulted at his home in Bowling Green.", "                The senator's injuries are described as minor, and Kentucky State Police say a suspect is in custody and facing one count of fourth-degree assault.", "                Mary Katharine Ham of The Federalist noted that such incidents are on the rise, and took a moment to thank those who rarely make the news but work in a difficult environment.", "\"This is the second violent attack on Paul himself this year. The earlier one, the congressional baseball shooting attempted assassination that left Steve Scalise injured, who is now back in Congress,\" Ham says.  \"Congressional security is running down more threats than usual and researching them.\""]}
