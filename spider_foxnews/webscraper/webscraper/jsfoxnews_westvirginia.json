He's married with three children: six-year-old son Elliott, three-year-old daughter Charlotte, and daughter Merritt, who will be 2 this July. Copley was a maintenance planner, but not anymore: His mine filed for bankruptcy early this year.", "Copley slid a photo of his three kids across the table to Hillary Clinton. He told her that he couldn't explain his situation \u2014 or her comments about putting coal miners out of work \u2014 to his children. He asked her how she could make those comments and then \"come in here and tell us how you're going to be our friend.\" He was representative, he said, of the angry crowd that had gathered outside.", "\"We were presented with the opportunity [to be at the roundtable] on Saturday \u2014 we coach three soccer teams, and we were asked if we were interested before one of our games,\" Copley told LifeZette in an exclusive interview about his experience. \"We immediately said yes. Of course I had moments where I thought: 'What am I getting into?'\"", "Copley prayed to God about the situation. \"I began to pray. I prayed through the day,\" he said. \"Then Sunday after church, I went to play golf with some friends, and I prayed about it during the hour-and-a-half drive to golf, and all the way back, too. I asked for the Lord to guide me in what to say and what to do at the meeting.\"", "\"I also fasted on Sunday,\" he said. \"People look at fasting differently, but for me, I decided not to eat for the whole day \u2014 giving up something that focuses on the flesh, and instead focus on the spirit.\"", "If coal mining goes away, as Hillary Clinton suggested it would if she could help it, then so would the livelihoods of coal miners such as Copley. Clinton knows this but seems loath to talk about in real terms. Yet to coal miners who live with that cloud of dread over their heads every day, real terms are all they have.", "\"There are not very many opportunities where I live,\" said Copley. \"I went to college and didn't finish, then I worked for a car dealership in the parts department \u2014 I may have made minimum wage there, around 5 to 7 dollars an hour.

In my opinion, you don't make those kinds of comments toward a particular set of people, and then go into the homes of those people without expecting someone to ask you about it.\"", "Copley is deeply conservative and is against abortion for very personal reasons.", "\"My wife and I had a miscarriage at 17 weeks, between our first and second child. It\u2019s one of the reasons I know that it\u2019s a life, and that abortion is murder,\" he said in his soft, serious tone. \"My wife felt that child grow inside of her, and we heard the child's heartbeat, so we had a connection to that child. For someone to say that child was not alive at any point really bothers us.\"", "Copley deeply believes in trusting God\u2019s plan. \"That child, had it gone full term, means our second child wouldn't have been born,\" he said. \"God is faithful.

Lauren is supporting the family right now, and we're a tag-team effort. She's a mom first, though \u2014 there's a reason daddies are called daddies and moms are called moms,\" he said, laughing.", "Copley marvels at God's plan, taking him from coal miner to someone who challenged a Democratic presidential candidate about the state of the coal mining industry.", "\"Letting someone become unemployed, and saying to them, 'Wait for the right opportunity \u2014 wait on Me,' it's been unreal.\u00a0It's been one of the most humbling experiences of my life,\" he added, speaking about Americans' responses to his face-to-face with Clinton. \"After the meeting we went to revival \u2014 we invited Hillary Clinton, too \u2014 and by the time we got back, everything had changed.\"", "\"I can't look at my phone or Facebook page without tearing up,\" Copley continued. \"I've gotten messages from strangers thanking me for standing up to Hillary, and for speaking out. For speaking up for our God. Last week, no one in the country would have cared what I thought \u2014 except for my soccer players,\" he added, laughing.", "Copley is not happy with the direction in which America is going. \"I'm not particularly proud of the state of our country at the moment,\" he said. \"We've always been guided by our faith in God as well as our military, and we\u2019ve all but removed God from the country. The current administration seems to have tried to weaken our military beyond repair.\"", "\"My faith and my hope is in God,\" he continued. \"I know that this country can be restored, because it was founded on God. There's a lot of people ready to put God back to the center of this nation.\"", "What will happen to Copley if coal is diminished as a power source in the U.S.? This remains unclear. \"This country was founded on coal,\" said Copley, \"and realistically we miners have nowhere else to go. But we turn to the Lord and put our faith in Him, and we will be restored in one way or another \u2014 if it's not with a situation will allow us to use coal, then He will make another opportunity available that we can utilize.\"", "When asked about the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, Copley said of Donald Trump, \"I would be very interested to hear what Mr. Trump has to say about our region. I've seen several interviews where he says the right thing. I pray to the Lord to make the right decision about voting for our next president.\""]},

He is awaiting sentencing.", "The settlement was bitterly criticized by some of the dead men's relatives, who said they won't be satisfied until charges are filed against those they consider responsible for the catastrophe, the nation's deadliest mine accident in 40 years.", "Gary Quarles, whose son Gary Wayne Quarles died in the disaster, said: \"I want to hear names, and I want to know what they're going to be charged for. Today would have been a fine day for them to have told us.\"", "Hours after the settlement was announced, the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration released a final report on the blast that detailed 369 safety violations at Upper Big Branch, including 12 it said contributed to the explosion. MSHA labeled nine of the violations that led to the accident as flagrant, the most serious designation, and said they included illegally tipping off miners that inspectors were on the site and failing to conduct proper safety inspections.", "\"The physical conditions that led to the explosion were the result of a series of basic safety violations at UBB and were entirely preventable,\" the report said.", "The report confirmed what the agency and other investigators said previously: that Massey allowed a buildup of highly explosive methane gas and combustible coal dust, and that worn and broken cutting equipment created the spark that ignited the fuel. Also, investigators said broken water sprayers allowed a mere flare-up to turn into an inferno that ripped through miles of underground tunnels and killed men instantly.", "\"Every time Massey sent miners into the UBB Mine, Massey put those miners' lives at risk,\" said MSHA director Joe Main. \"Massey management created a culture of fear and intimidation in their miners to hide their reckless practices. Today's report brings to light the tragic consequences of a corporate culture that values production over people.\"", "The settlement consists of $46.5 million in restitution to the miners' families, $128 million for safety improvements, research and training, and $35 million in fines for safety violations at Upper Big Branch and other Massey mines.", "The deal seeks to guarantee that the families of the 29 dead miners and two co-workers who survived the explosion will each receive $1.5 million. Those who accept the payout can still pursue lawsuits, but the $1.5 million will be deducted from any settlement or jury award. At least eight families of dead miners previously settled with Massey.", "Alpha CEO Kevin Crutchfield said the company cooperated fully with authorities and believes the agreement represents \"the best path forward for everyone.\"", "\"We're particularly pleased that a substantial portion of the settlement is going towards furthering miner safety, which has always been Alpha's guiding principle,\" he said.", "The deal was seen as precedent-setting, not just because of the amount of money, but because a lot of it is going toward research that could make mining safer. It was also seen as an attempt by Alpha to put the scandal behind it.", "\"Alpha definitely knows they had a problem. Whenever they bought Massey, they bought all of Massey's older problems,\" said Bruce Dial, who runs a mine consulting company out of Pineville, N.C. \"This is their way of saying, `Massey did this, we bought Massey, let's settle up and start new.\"'", "Well before the disaster, Massey had a poor safety record, and the coal company and its hard-nosed CEO, Don Blankenship, had a reputation among their union critics for treating fines as the cost of doing business.", "MSHA said its investigation found \"systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts\" by Massey to cover up problems, including keeping two sets of inspection books -- an accurate one for itself, and a fake one for regulators.", "The federal agency also said it will conduct an internal review of its own actions at Upper Big Branch. Relatives of the victims and officials with the United Mine Workers union have rebuked MSHA for not shutting down the mine before the tragedy.", "Under Tuesday's settlement, Virginia-based Alpha will invest $48 million in a mine-safety research trust and spend an additional $80 million to improve safety at all of its mines with the latest technology. The improvements will include coating mines with crushed limestone to reduce the risk of a coal-dust explosion; using digital sensors to continuously monitor air flow and methane levels; and adopting emergency oxygen equipment, similar to what firefighters rely on, to give miners an uninterrupted supply of air while trying to escape from an underground accident.", "\"This in several ways is a revolutionary resolution,\" Goodwin said. \"We wanted it to be something constructive and forward-looking.\"", "Clay Mullins, whose brother Rex died in the mine, said he wants to see criminal charges brought against executives at Massey, not just against low- and mid-level managers.", "\"It was an act of murder,\" he said. \"They murdered 29 men, and I'm not satisfied one bit.\" Mullins said he also believes MSHA bears some responsibility.", "MSHA coal administrator Kevin Stricklin defended the agency, saying that his inspectors shut the mine down 48 times in the year before the blast but had to allow it to reopen when problems were fixed. He said MSHA lacked the authority to close it permanently and still does.", "\"We thought we were keeping accidents from happening,\" he said."]},

That's where we get the job creation that we need. That's where we get revenue for the government.", "You're right, the real problem is the spending side. I mean, look at what we've done. After almost 50 years in which federal spending averaged about 20 percent of GDP, Joe Sestak and Nancy Pelosi took federal spending to 25 percent. You know, that's a 25 percent increase in the size of the government overnight. That's what we -- that's what we've got to rein in.", "I would -- I would end the bailouts. I disagreed with bailouts as a policy. I think we should rescind the unspent portion of the stimulus bill. I'd like to abolish earmarks. And I'll tell you what, Chris, that's -- that could be a big item. It's not just the cost of the individual earmarks but it's also the fact that they've become a currency to buy votes for bloated appropriation bills.", "I think we should look at consolidating all kinds of programs in the government. You know, we found 75 different programs between the Department of Education and the Department of State that all subsidize one form or another of overseas student travel and student education. I mean, that's the kind of waste and duplication that we can rein in.", "That -- all together, those items that I just listed add up to many billions of dollars. And that would start us back on the right path.", "WALLACE: I want to also ask you, Mr. Toomey, about entitlements, because you have talked -- and I want to be clear here -- about letting younger Americans, not those who are currently in Social Security, not those who are close to Social Security, but younger Americans use some of their payroll taxes to invest in private accounts.", "What happens if we encounter another one of these financial meltdowns and millions of people lose their nest eggs? What would happen to them then?", "TOOMEY: Well, first of all, let's be clear. You know, 60 percent of the entire budget is entitlement spending. It's the automatic big programs. And if we're ever going to get back on a viable fiscal path we've got to figure out what we're going to do with those programs.", "I've said that we should never, under any circumstances, cut benefits for people who are already retired or close to retirement. That would be outrageous and unreasonable, and I would never go there.", "But if we're going to be honest, we've got to acknowledge that these programs cannot exist in their current form precisely indefinitely. The demographics won't sustain it. So I've argued that younger workers should have this choice. If they want to participate in the current system, that's fine. But if they want to participate in a reformed Social Security program where they can accumulate some savings, I would allow for that, too. And I think there could be tremendous upside both because it allows the government's financings to get squared away, but also giving workers ownership.", "To -- specifically to your point, the simple solution is that any such investment plan would be regulated. And in the early years when a worker is quite young, in teens, 20s, 30s, the investments could be heavily weighted for stocks.", "But as a person approached their retirement age, the portfolio would transition to much less volatile capital preservation instruments like bank deposits, C.D.s and Treasuries.", "WALLACE: Mr. Toomey...", "TOOMEY: ... so that someone approaching retirement would not be subject to the -- to the volatility that you can see in the stock market.", "WALLACE: I want to give you a little time to talk about your opponent in the -- in the couple of minutes we have left. Joe Sestak, as you point out, supported the Obama stimulus plan. And as you say, he said it should be even bigger than the $800 billion. Your comment?", "TOOMEY: Right. Well, this is consistent with Joe Sestak's extreme views. As I said, he's to the left of Nancy Pelosi on just about every item. He said the stimulus bill wasn't big enough, should have been a trillion dollars.", "The health care bill he voted for -- and in committee he voted for a version of the bill that would have allowed states to ban all private health insurance altogether.", "He supported cap and trade, which would be devastating to Pennsylvania's economy, and he said it didn't go far enough.", "He's even advocated that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the admitted mastermind of 9/11, be given a civilian trial in Pennsylvania, which is a terrible idea.", "Joe's really a liberal's liberal. He's an ideologue who's off the charts, to the left of the Democratic Party consensus, and the policies that these guys have been pursuing -- they've been preventing us from having the economic recovery that we could be having.", "That's why I think my campaign is doing very well, and I'm going to continue to advocate for job growth in the private sector, getting spending under control and just bringing some balance to Washington.", "WALLACE: Couple of minutes left. Can the GOP take back the Senate if you lose in Pennsylvania?", "TOOMEY: Well, I'm not going to lose in Pennsylvania. We're going to win this race. And I think the GOP has an excellent chance of taking back the Senate.", "WALLACE: But I mean, this is pretty key. This is one of the real cornerstones, is it not -- I would say keystones -- of their effort to take back the Senate?", "TOOMEY: That's true, Chris. You know how it is. We've got a certain number of races in play. The Republicans have to run the table on virtually all of the competitive races in order to take control. I'm not as close to the other races as obviously I am to my own. I think we've got a great shot here.", "This is close. This is tough. But I think we're going to pull it out. And I think we're going to be in the majority.", "WALLACE: And in the final -- you do believe that the Republicans will take back the Senate?", "TOOMEY: I do, yeah. I acknowledge that it's tough. It's not obvious. But I think -- I think we're likely to do that.", "WALLACE: And in 30 seconds, we got nine days to go. What's the -- what's the key to this final week, sir?", "TOOMEY: The key is for me to continue to get my message out to the swing voters, to the independent voters, who understand that Washington's on the wrong track. We can't borrow and spend our way to prosperity. The government is not the source of wealth and opportunity.", "I'm the guy who's started businesses, I've been a small business owner. I've employed hundreds of Pennsylvanians. I know how to get jobs moving in the private sector, rein in the excesses in Washington, and bring some balance to a town that's lost all balance. And that's why I think people in the end are going to be with me.", "WALLACE: Mr. Toomey, we're going to have to leave it there. We want to thank you so much for joining us today and we'll see how things turn out in nine short days.", "TOOMEY: Thanks for having me, Chris.", "WALLACE: Up next, we turn to West Virginia and their popular Democratic governor who's in the race of his life to become that state's next senator.", "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "WALLACE: Democrat Robert Byrd held his West Virginia Senate seat for 51 years, longer than anyone who's served in Congress. Now it's up to Governor Joe Manchin to keep the office against a tough opponent, Republican businessman John Raese.", "Joining us from Charleston, West Virginia is Mr. Manchin. We invited Mr. Raese but he declined.", "Governor, welcome to \"Fox News Sunday.\"", "GOV. JOE MANCHIN, D-W.VA.: Thank you for having me, Chris.", "WALLACE: I got to tell you, Governor, this is one of the strangest races, I think, in the country this year. You have...", "MANCHIN: Yeah.", "WALLACE: ... a 68 percent approval rating from West Virginians. As a Democrat, you have been endorsed for the Senate by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association.", "But let's take a look at the numbers. According to the RealClearPolitics average of recent polls, you are leading your opponent, businessman John Raese, by just 1.5 points, basically a dead heat. And in fact, in some polls you're trailing him. Question: How come?", "MANCHIN: It's a very competitive race. It's a different time. I can't explain it no more can you, Chris. But one thing about, I think, now this last week, people are starting to look at who's performed in West Virginia. Who's been here and who's fought the fights that we needed to change West Virginia?", "And you know, we brought all sides together. Six years ago I said, when I became governor, I thought we could do better. I didn't want politics as usual, Democrats and Republicans fighting, or business and labor fighting.", "I brought them all together and said, \"Leave your politics at the door. Let's put West Virginia first and let's fix things.\" And we did it, and our state's in much better shape than most any state in the nation because of it.", "WALLACE: Well, Governor, let me suggest one reason you may be in a tight race, and that is that while West Virginians apparently like you, they really don't like President Obama and his policies. He's got a 33 percent approval rating in West Virginia.", "Your opponent says if elected to the Senate you're going to turn into, as he puts it, \"Washington Joe\" and turn into a rubber stamp for Obama. Let's watch.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)", "JOHN RAESE, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR WEST VIRGINIA SENATE: You have to wonder -- wonder -- about Obama and Manchin and which direction that they're going. When you have people like Obama and certainly Manchin, you have to be concerned about the future of this country.", "(END VIDEO CLIP)", "WALLACE: Governor, you can show your independence right now. Where do you disagree with President Obama's policies these last two years?", "MANCHIN: Well, Chris, let me tell you this. I had to inform my opponent that President Obama's name will not be on the ballot for the U.S. Senate in West Virginia. It will be Joe Manchin.", "People are looking at what I have been able to do by bringing people together -- Democrats, independents and Republicans. And we've been successful. They don't want to talk about the records whatsoever. They want to talk about guilt through association.", "The bottom line is West Virginia -- West Virginia is a different -- when I say different, we are for family values. We are hard- working people. We have the best in the world. And with that being said, we're in much better shape.", "President Obama -- cap and trade -- we just differ. We respectfully differ on that. He is -- I believe, in my estimation, he's wrong on that issue. West Virginians basically have always been patriotic, helping this nation, supplying the energy that the nation needs. We can do it better. We've always done it better. We've cleaned up the environment...", "WALLACE: Other than cap and trade...", "MANCHIN: ... in two decades more...", "WALLACE: Excuse me, Governor, but other than cap and trade, any other areas where you disagree with the Obama policies?", "MANCHIN: Well, his -- the health care reform is far overreaching in areas that I don't agree with -- the 1099 part of that, the mandates. Also, the firewall's not strong enough for abortions. I'm pro-life. And we're just a different type of Democrat here in West Virginia.", "WALLACE: Let me get specific, and let's begin with health care. You now say, as you just did, that President Obama overreached on health care reform, especially the individual health care mandate.", "But back just in March, when the bill was up in the House, you said if you were a congressman, quote, \"I'd be for it. You have to move this ball forward.\" You said you would have been in the House as a Congressman, Governor, you would have voted for the health care reform bill.", "MANCHIN: Yeah. Chris, health reform -- I am for health reform. I think every American should be for health reform, because you can't sustain it. In West Virginia, the most vulnerable people we have are people who get up every morning and go to work. They have usually nothing to rely to...", "WALLACE: But individual...", "MANCHIN: ... and they're...", "(CROSSTALK)", "MANCHIN: ... away from bankruptcy.", "WALLACE: ... mandate was a big part of that bill, sir.", "MANCHIN: Well, the bottom line is that the incentives should be created, the incentives for health care reform, basically so people can afford health care. You're not going to mandate and dictate to them.", "And with the bill you're talking about, we were talking about the preexisting conditions. We have six or seven items that both Democrats and Republicans agree on. That's a pretty good start in West Virginia when you have a piece of legislation everyone agrees on.", "Reaching as far as they did in the -- in the weeds of the bill that we didn't know about, no one else knew about until it came out -- knowing that, I would not have supported that or voted for that at that time.", "The concept of preexisting conditions, children not being denied from being on insurances, or elderly people in West Virginia, if you have cancer or black lung, couldn't buy insurance -- I'm not going to say no to those people until I know we can fix what's wrong with them.", "WALLACE: I just want to -- I just want to pin you down on this, though. You're saying now that if you'd known what was really in the bill, although last March you said you'd have voted for it, you now say you would have voted against it?", "MANCHIN: Correct. Now, knowing the existence as far as how reaching it had been, as far as an onerous, I would have. And I think many people didn't know about the bill. It ends up, what, 2,000 pages or more.", "Now, the concept was great as far as preexisting conditions. How do we make sure more people have affordable insurance? How do we take care of children, people with preexisting conditions, keeping children on insurances longer because of the market conditions?", "There's a lot of good parts to it. Why won't we fix what's wrong with it and make it better?", "WALLACE: OK. Let's talk about, as you did -- your first answer about differing with the president was about cap and trade, which, of course, is controversial in West Virginia, which is a big coal producer. You now say that you're flat-out against cap and trade.", "MANCHIN: I've always...", "WALLACE: Well, let's take a look at that. This is what you now say...", "MANCHIN: Sure.", "WALLACE: ... about President Obama, \"He is dead wrong on cap and trade. It would be the ruin not only of our state of West Virginia but this entire economy for this country.\"", "But, Governor, here's what you said just two years ago during the presidential campaign.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)", "MANCHIN: Barack brings that leadership to us.

Now, they're going to have to pay for the carbons, whether cap and trade or whether it's in the carbon tax.", "(END VIDEO CLIP)", "WALLACE: Governor, it sure sounds like you favored cap and trade.", "MANCHIN: Sure. No, never did favor cap and trade from the standpoint -- what we were talking about -- that's during the campaign. I had a lot of high hopes for President Obama, basically understood the balance of the environment and the economy and energy that was needed to be competitive in the global economy, Chris.", "Twenty years ago we had what we called acid rain, if you recall. We were able to fix acid rain. We didn't tax coal. We didn't legislate or regulate coal out of existence. Coal basically transformed using scrubbers and technology, low Knox (ph) blowers. We can do the same thing with CO2.", "They have to make sure that they're committed to getting the technology that fixes the problem. Cap and trade as they're proposing it right now -- why in the world would you allow nuclear or hydro or wind or solar to trade in credits when they don't produce any CO2? It doesn't...", "WALLACE: But, Governor...", "MANCHIN: ... make any sense.", "WALLACE: ... why did you in that interview in 2008 say now they're going to have to pay for the carbons, whether a cap and trade or whether it's in a carbon tax?", "MANCHIN: Basically, the users of the -- the users of the energy -- and that was the emitters -- let's say that the utilities for the CO2 -- whoever is emitting CO2, you have basically a parameter to fix it through technology.", "We had -- and SO2 as far as acid rain. We had technology. We don't have proven technology. We have carbon sequestration, which we're doing in West Virginia. We can do with technology. We have the ability to use our coal and use it in a fashion that's more attractive from the standpoint -- we can help the rest of the world.", "WALLACE: Governor...", "MANCHIN: China's using more coal than ever...", "WALLACE: Governor, I want...", "MANCHIN: ... than America, Chris.", "WALLACE: I don't want to interrupt, but I do want to give you an opportunity to talk about your opponent, John Raese. You question whether he's even a legal resident of West Virginia, but his campaign says that he pays income and property taxes in your state.", "MANCHIN: Chris, what we're talking about is setting your priorities. Where do you want to be? Where have you set your -- where have you, you know, really laid your claim? And where do you spend your time? And where do you try to fix the problems that we have?", "My opponent and his family have a home and enjoy the homestead exemption in Palm Beach, Florida. I mean, that's pretty much known by everybody. And we're saying is all the income that's produced and all the income that's by the family being paid taxes in West Virginia supporting our state? Those are legitimate questions to be asked.", "I can assure you that my wife and I -- every penny of income we've ever had, our taxes were paid in West Virginia. So people are going to look at the priorities. Who has the ability to bring people together, Democrats and Republicans, independents, sit down, working out the problems of West Virginia?", "WALLACE: Governor, let me ask you...", "MANCHIN: Who's been able to be successful at that?", "WALLACE: Let me just ask you about one other issue, because you say that John Raese wants to do away with the minimum wage. His campaign says that he believes that government controls have made it harder for employers to hire young workers who have a high unemployment rate.", "MANCHIN: Well, the minimum wage -- if he's talking about minimum wage, there's no cap on it, John. You can pay whatever you want to. But when you say you want to do away with it because it's not enough, no one's going to be fooled into believing that.", "If you want to do away with it, that's because you want it to go lower. We have basically a basement or a floor, if we can, to protect people who depend on it, and a lot of them for their second jobs.", "When you talk about the lasers in space, and in the Education Department, doing away with the Department of Education, but we're talking about 1,000 lasers, and 20 billion or more dollars, where are the priorities? And that's what we're talking.", "There's a big difference between he and I -- me being involved in the front line of West Virginia, solving problems by bringing people together. We have a proven record. We've only seen John during the campaign and every time he's run. That's the difference.", "WALLACE: Governor Manchin, we're going to have to leave it there.

What do you make of your dismissal and this extraordinary reaction to it?", "WILLIAMS: Well, it was a rough week, Chris. To get fired, obviously, is no pleasure, but then to be called a bigot and the innuendo that I'm somehow unstable was, I thought, despicable.", "What I make of this is it's open to debate about the importance of having free-flowing and honest discussion in this country. I don't think I started it. I think there was action taken that then set this afloat in the country.", "I think Americans feel, you know what? There is nothing wrong in telling someone how you feel, and then to be punished for that is unfair, and it amounts to censorship. And the idea that then they would engage in character assassination against me and about my professional behavior given the work I've done, I just think it was regrettable.", "But I think it's important that people be able to cross to each other across political lines. I think it's important that I irritate Brit Hume and Bill Kristol every Sunday.", "WALLACE: And you succeed at that.", "WILLIAMS: And that they fire back at me. And they may raise their eyebrows and make faces, but you know what? These people are honest with me, and I don't question their integrity. And why my integrity has to be questioned -- I mean, to me, I'm still in the storm of it, but I just thought it was unfair.", "WALLACE: I have to say, this is the first time we have seen each other, because you've been up in New York this whole week. You're really hurt by this, aren't you?", "WILLIAMS: Well, yes. I don't want that to be the focus. I want to move on from this. This is not going to define me and my career.", "I think that the importance of the debate is true, that we, as Americans, have to have this debate.

Is the tremendous amount of public support that I have received from people both right and left.", "It would have been easy for the right to say, well, you know, we've been subject to this kind of treatment from the left for a long time, but if you say something that they don't like, they call you a racist or a bigot. But what has been tremendously surprising to me is that people on the left have resisted the temptation to simply say, well, you know, we're not going to say anything against NPR.", "People said, you know what? This isn't right. And I think that's just an important moment in American public life.", "WALLACE: I want to ask you one more question and then we'll bring everybody else in. Your former bosses at NPR, the specific grounds for your dismal, said the problem was that you're a news analyst. You're supposed to provide analysis based on fact and, in fact, they say you provided an opinion.", "I want to show though before I get your answer what some of your colleagues at NPR have said over the years.", "In March, Cokie Roberts wrote a column about Glenn Beck in which she said this: \"Beck is worse than a clown.

Just to be blunt, I think that they were using a lot of this as a pretext to get rid of me.", "I think they don't like the idea that I appear on Fox News. I think they think that somehow, in their own state of mind, I am somehow legitimizing Fox News by simply appearing on shows, rather than being willing to engage in debate and discussion. I think that is in the great American tradition.", "The second point that I want to make very quickly, Chris, before you bring other people in here is this -- they suggest that I somehow violated NPR's standards, journalistic standards, by telling people about a feeling I had. I think in terms of my values, and I think -- I hope in terms of everybody's values for journalists, that people should be open and able to say this is how I feel in this situation, let's talk about it.

Fact-basis analysis, fine. Not opinions.", "Juan has expressed opinions over the years here on Fox. It's always sat badly.", "There's no evidence that Nina Totenberg has ever been in any way criticized, warned, or has suffered any loss of standing for her free- wheeling opinion dispensing that she has done on that show inside Washington for the better part of two decades.

The standard that was applied to Juan Williams is manifesting not being applied to other NPR people.", "And I think it's simply this -- that in the culture of NPR, appearing on Fox is a sin.

So it looks like -- it looks like it will happen in the House for the Republicans. It could happen in the Senate. But at the moment, it looks like a tough, tough road.", "WALLACE: Nina, \"The Wall Street Journal\" had -- I was going to say a fascinating report. It may have been the single most interesting article in the papers this week.", "For all the talk from Democrats about conservative groups with undisclosed donors bankrolling this campaign, they did some actual reporting about campaign spending. Let's put it up on the screen.", "According to The Journal, AFSCME, the public employees union, is the biggest outside donor in this cycle, $87.5 million. Then the Chamber of Commerce, $75 million. American Crossroads, the conservative group, $65 million. And then two unions: the service employees, $44 million, and the National Education Association, $40 million.", "Nina, that's a very different picture than the president has been painting.", "EASTON: No kidding. As we all know, the Chamber of Commerce has been in the crosshairs of this White House.", "Unions are spending -- one of the reasons for the tightening of races, unions are spending $200 million nationwide, which undermines the theory, the narrative that the White House and other Democrats are trying to put out, which is that these nefarious business groups with anonymous donors which were allowed by the Supreme Court Citizens United decision -- which the president called out in January as a strike at the heart of democracy, by the way -- that because of that, Republicans are basically taking the election, stealing the election with all this funding.", "In fact, you had anonymous donors before the Citizens United decision. You had the unions spending this amount of money. And it just doesn't -- and I also want to -- the media is buying into this narrative, by the way. And I'm wondering where all the media hand- wringing was in 2006 and 2008 when the outside funding was on the Democrats' side, clearly.", "I mean, they were applauded. This is where the energy is, this is where the money is going. And now we are seeing all these kind of dark stories in the media about business groups and awful things.", "WALLACE: Let me follow up on that with you, Bill, because the Democrats would fire back and they'd say, well, OK, AFSCME is spending a lot of money. We know it's AFSCME members, or SEIU, or the NEA. But with some of these Republican groups, the Chamber of Commerce, American Crossroads, it can be huge contributions from undisclosed -- of millions of dollars from undisclosed donors, not union dues.", "KRISTOL: Yes, it's a free country. You know? And I think it's a healthy thing that there has been incredible participation by big donors and also by small donors.", "And Nina makes the point about the media loving it when President Obama -- when the Democrats, in '06, that Rahm Emanuel got praised widely in Washington, he's so clever, he's got a lot of business contribution to the Democrats. \"The New York Times\" this morning begins a story on the race, front page, \"A costly and polarizing congressional campaign heads into its final week.\"", "You know, for me, it's not costly and polarizing congressional -- couldn't one say an inspiring congressional campaign which has featured record numbers of small dollar contributions and volunteer activity? This is the most active the citizenry of the United States has been in an off-year election probably ever, but certainly in the last 50, 60, 70 years.", "If you look at the numbers, you look at the numbers of people volunteering, people contributing on the Internet and the like, shouldn't this be something to be heralded? The president and mainstream media want to portray it as a dark taking over of power by big groups. It's not working out, obviously.", "The numbers haven't changed much. And if anything, I would say in the last few days, it looks like the primary wave is reasserting itself. And I think Republicans are going to do better than 60 seats now in the House, and I think they have a pretty good chance to win the Senate, actually.", "WALLACE: Juan?", "WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think they have a chance to win the Senate. I think that if you look at it, actually, there's tightening. And I think you can almost track where President Obama has gone, where he is going next week, in seeing what the White House and Democrat strategy is.", "President Obama is going to go to Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio. In all those seats, all of a sudden, those races now are so tight that it's hard to call them.", "Who thought, for example, that in Pennsylvania, Joe Sestak would be making a comeback? I thought that race was gone. Apparently, it's not.", "Look at Colorado. I thought Bennet was gone again. Apparently, he's not.", "I think Democrats are making a comeback. And it's not because of the financial argument, because I don't think that has gained traction in the voters' minds. Instead, I think some people are being portrayed as too extreme, out of the mainstream. And the idea is, wait a minute, let's give change a chance, rather than simply throw everything out because you are upset over health care reform and the like. That argument now doesn't have the passion it did a few weeks ago.", "WALLACE: Brit?", "KRISTOL: Hope and change. To me, that's what this election is about.", "WALLACE: Brit?", "HUME: Well, the thing you can't know -- and the pollsters do the best they can with their likely voter screens and where they ask people who respond to the polls a certain number of questions, trying to determine how great the chances are that they're going to come out and vote. My sense about this election all along is evidenced going back however long it's been to the beginning of the Tea Party, is there is this tremendous energy of resistance. And this is the first chance that people who are opposed to what President Obama and the Democrats in Congress have done finally get a chance to do something about it more than gather in protest, more than write letters, and more than carry signs.", "The hope for the Democrats resides in the fact that a vote cast with gusto by an angry Tea Party activist or other energized citizen doesn't count any more than the vote of somebody who is rounded up, half asleep, and dragged to the polls in a bus by a good organization. But I do think there's a real possibility that that energy which I described will turn out voters in places we never expected we'd find them, and that it will just wash over all the efforts that are being made against it and we could have one of these great big washouts in which the House goes big, the Senate goes the works (ph), and the governorships all go, and it's just a big wipeout.", "WALLACE: For the last time that this is ever going to happen?", "You get the last word, Juan.", "WILLIAMS: That's unbelievable. I guess I'm getting some courtesy here. Thank you, Chris.", "(CROSSTALK)", "WALLACE: It's one week only.", "WILLIAMS: It's one week only. I think President Obama is trying to stir the black vote. He's trying to stir the women vote. He's trying to stir the youth vote because the passion -- I mean, right now there is no indication that much change is coming, because the Republicans do have the energy in this cycle. No question about it.", "WALLACE: All right.", "Thank you, panel. Thank you for ending up on time. See you next week.

I have really strong opinions, but I could never fake it and think I could be a general manager or a coach.", "WALLACE (voice-over): Leonsis spends 40 percent of his time away from sports.

A lot of the concern from Republicans was that it takes from military pensions, and they say, like Senator Graham, that, well, it is just not fair. What do you say to him?", "MANCHIN: Well first of all, I've been a Bowles-Simpson supporter from day one since I've gotten here three years ago, and I would like to see a bigger deal, because I've always believed that you have to put your financial house in order before you can do anything. I did it when I was governor and let everything else go by the wayside until I knew that we could take care of our priorities based on our values. That's just the way I think it should be done, and we're not getting there.\u00a0 So which what happened with the budget, we didn't get a perfect budget. It is the first resemblance of any type of a budget, the process that we have that kind of resembles something of normal order going through appropriations. And with that, we're going to work hard to try to fix that with the military.", "It is the one percent COLA reduction -- anyone under 62. And you can say those are promises we made and we should be able to keep and you would think in normal times we should. But everybody is vulnerable right now and we have to go try to fix that. But it is what was in front of us, and we don't have any options of walking away and going into a shutdown again.", "BAIER: Like Graham and Ayotte, these senators say if there is anybody we should be protecting to find $6 billion a year, it is the military.", "MANCHIN: We all feel that way. But the bottom line is, with this being said, that was one of the things worked out between the Democrats and Republicans, and you had 333 vote in the House with that there, and I think we don't have a chance to amend anything. So do you want to go through a shutdown process, is where we would be, or do you move forward and try to fix it when we come back?", "BAIER: Charles?", "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Senator, on the budget, we seem to be through that. But what we're looking at now is a debt ceiling. We heard Republicans saying they will not let it go by without something being done or something -- if you want to use the word, extracted. Do you think there should be a clean debt ceiling or do you think it would be right for the Congress to use the occasion to do something to reduce our indebtedness?", "MANCHIN: Yeah, I'm probably not the right Democrat to ask about a clean debt ceiling because I have not voted. I had to \u2013 I got caught in a procedural vote to move it forward. I really think that you have to come to grips with it.", "KRAUTHAMMER: And what would you like to see happen at the debt ceiling?", "MANCHIN: Well, again, a bigger picture needs to be looked at. And that is when the Bowles-Simpson came in. Charles, as you know, they looked at revenue, they looked at expenditures, they looked at reforms. And all of that has to be taken into consideration. You can't put one side in the box. And what we are doing now, we are just making you vote and take score, trying to use it against you. I would rather fix something, and we have to get together here and come to grips with it. We have to have some reforms.", "KRAUTHAMMER: But there is no way that would happen before a debt ceiling?", "MANCHIN: The debt ceiling is going to come, right, and there is going to be something put on the table I think by the Republicans.", "KRAUTHAMMER: What would you like to see?", "MANCHIN: I would like to see long-term reductions, I would like to see a downward path to at least a balanced budget. As a former governor, that is the first thing when we ask the question going into the capitals is, what is the revenue? Once you know the revenues you know what your spending limits are. There is no such control such as that here.", "So as a Democrat, and we have many Democrats I believe that would like to see balanced budgets. No one thought we could do it in the 90's and they did it working with a Republican Congress and a Democrat president and it got accomplished. I think we could do it again. I think it could be the greatest confidence builder this country every had to our economy.", "GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: How do you get to a balanced budget when the deal we just had makes no dent at all in the trajectory of the country and the entitlement state, and your party which whom you are notoriously discordant on occasions, flinches even from even the chained CPI, that is a tiny little adjustment of the way we calculate inflation. If they can't do that, what can they do about the entitlement state?", "MANCHIN: Well, George, it makes look at how we operate the entitlements, not looking at taking anyone's benefits away from them. But are the people getting benefits that shouldn't have gotten them? People -- are they getting them under false pretenses and there is no review back for total disability -- for Social Security, disabilities? There is so many things in fraud, waste, and abuse, if we could just get agreement to really go after that, it would be, I think, a blessing.", "And why people are afraid -- my concern is, is it going to be there for the next generation? When you look at Social Security, they say if we don't do anything, 2035 or 2037 maybe, and on Medicare is much worse, 2024 or 2026, and then also Social Security disability, 2016. So I don't know how far they can kick the down or how much longer. Sooner over later you got to pay the piper.", "WILL: But every day 10,000 more baby boomers become eligible for Social Security and Medicare. And you are on the committee on aging and you speak eloquently about taking care of the elderly, but the welfare is an enormous regressive transfer of wealth to the most affluent age cohort in the country, the elderly, who after a lifetime of accumulation are better off than the young and middle aged people who are paying all these benefits?", "MANCHIN: I've always been partial to a means testing. I've always looked at means testing from the standpoint of fairness to it. And I always said my parents worked hard and they were in a little better shape and I've had other relatives that have needed a little bit more assistance, and I don't think my parents would begrudge them whatsoever on the means tested if there's had been a little bit different than someone in more need.", "WILL: But the Democratic mantra has been Ted Kennedy's axiom that a program for the poor is a program, because if your means test -- it will look like a program for the poor and the middle class will withdraw its support. Do you reject that?", "MANCHIN: Well, we've never tried it so I don't know if it will work.", "WILL: We have to try something different.", "JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: So the Democrats \u2013 from the Democrat's perspective on this budget, senator, the complaint has been in order to get Republican votes you could not extend unemployment insurance for those who had long-term unemployment. And therefore, that's the deal that had to be made. But what about people in West Virginia, long-term uninsured, as George Will pointed out early, people still say we are in a recession, how do you feel about not helping them in this Christmas season?", "MANCHIN: Juan, I don't think anyone, I mean, you look at it as not being compassionate about people looking for work. You need to look at state by state, what their conditions are. Some states have lower unemployment and some states have higher. They have four tiers right they work within, their one, two, three, and four. We qualify in West Virginia for one, two, and three, not four.", "And with that being said, I understand today Dean Heller, our Republican from Nevada, and you had Jack Reed from Rhode Island, are talking about some type of compassionate three-month extension to some of this. But sooner or later, I would just ask when is that unemployment going to be acceptable to when we go back to normal order of 26 weeks?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "WILLIAMS: Well, that's understandable, but I think part of the conversation taking place on the Hill is will Republicans ever accept tax hikes in this current environment, or is that absolutely never going to happen, can you never make a deal with Republicans in which you would say, here, we'll cut some programs but we need some revenue enhancement?", "MANCHIN: Juan, here is the thing. We are just trying to get agreement on the definition of revenue. Is revenue when you increase taxes? To me that's revenue. If it is 35 and goes to 36 or 37, that is new revenue. If it is at 35 percent and you go to 31 but you have efficiencies, you close loopholes, and offset some credits and efficiencies, is that revenue? And then if they say, well, that is different. Well, if it's different you are still concerned with how we spend it.", "Couldn't Democrats and Republicans agree that we have one tremendous debt problem in our country and they are going to say for every new dollar of revenue, no matter how we get it, 60 or 70 cents will go to debt reduction. The remainder goes to infrastructure, nothing to grow the programs out.\u00a0 We live within our means, we run it more efficiently.\u00a0", "BAIER: Senator if you stand by, we have another segment coming up.\u00a0 More with Senator Manchin, ObamaCare and other issues after a quick time-out."]},
