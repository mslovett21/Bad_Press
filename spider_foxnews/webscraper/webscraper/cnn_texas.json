I love you people,\" he said. \"I wouldn't miss a chance to talk to my friends.\"", "On Friday morning, a little less than two years since his infamous no-show, Trump arrived as promised. But the organization and movement he first encountered here in Maryland, just outside of Washington, DC, years ago, has changed. ", "It's still a circus, but Trump is now the unquestioned ringmaster.

I started running, and people say, 'Are you sure he's a conservative?' I think, now, we've proved that I'm a conservative, right?\"", "Through 13 months in office, Trump has delivered for that conservative base.

His Cabinet secretaries shuffled on and offstage, but the buzz belonged to a new crop of invitees, like the heiress to the French National Front's far right-wing political dynasty, Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, who warned on Thursday that her country \"is in the process of passing from the eldest daughter of the Catholic Church to the little niece of Islam.\"", "The line was met with a chorus of boos, but not for Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, who was rewarded with cheers throughout a brief speech meant to cast herself in common cause with Trump's nationalist politics.

", "\"Why bother?\" Shapiro sneered, after allowing the rumbling to run its course. \"She's already in a jail of her own making somewhere in the woods of upstate New York.\" ", "The chorus would spring up again, less than 24 hours later, when Trump took his turn on the same stage.", "Floors down from the headliners, at the foot of a slow escalator not yet painted gold, Samantha Correia, the 21-year-old programs director for the Atlas Society and former California field director for Turning Point USA, a college conservative group, talked about her own evolution. ", "\"I started out as a huge fan of Marco Rubio, liked Scott Walker as well, and love-love-loved Ted Cruz,\" she said.", "Now, though, she was all in on Trump -- and channeling in her own words his unique blend of grievance and nostalgia for some notion of lost American \"greatness.\"", "\"What it comes down to,\" she explained, \"is conservatives are tired of being stepped on. Let's be honest here, we're in the United States of America. This is the greatest country that ever has existed and is the greatest country that exists, in my opinion. What established this country as so great, and why we're returning to an original greatness, is because of these ideals.\"", "That any CPAC gathering would attract strident partisans and ideological activists, even those who might not have known the event existed a year ago, is the norm. But in 2018, those \"outsiders\" aren't simply being welcomed, they're quickly taking over, placing its destiny firmly in their command. In the days before the conference kicked off, American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp fended off outside conservatives' worry (and anger) over Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen's appearance. But the fight never escalated beyond Twitter.

Manafort's indictment deals specifically with financial dealings  -- money laundering etc. -- and therefore allows Trump to insist that what Manafort did is all about Manafort and nothing about Trump or the 2016 campaign.", "It's important to take a breath here and remind yourself that it's likely -- though not certain -- that we are at the beginning of the legal proceedings stemming from Mueller's special counsel investigation, not the end.

", "In the battle for control of both Congress and the White House, Republicans rely overwhelmingly on the places in the US that remain the least touched by immigration. Democrats depend primarily on the places with the most immigrants. ", "That contrast frames the inverse dynamic driving this volatile debate: generally it is the places with the least exposure to immigrants that are seeking to limit future migration, over the objections of the places with the most. ", "Even that paradox doesn't capture the full complexity of the conflict. At the federal level, Republicans led by President Donald Trump are now urging not only a crackdown on undocumented immigrants, but also the biggest reduction in legal immigration since the 1920s. But simultaneously, more local officials from both parties across the heartland are trying to attract immigrants they consider indispensable to their strategies for maintaining economic vitality and a critical mass of population.  ", "\"My sense is if you talk to local elected officials, policy makers, business owners, faith leaders, they get it -- they completely understand that immigration is what is going to keep them going,\" says Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, and author of the book \"There Goes The Neighborhood,\" which explores how communities across America are adapting to new arrivals. \"But, especially in this day and age, for them to make that case publicly, when the other bullhorn is held by the President, is really, really hard.\" ", "Trump would trade protection for \"Dreamers\" for drastic cuts in legal immigration", "Trump has disappointed some conservatives by indicating that he's willing to accept a pathway to citizenship -- albeit an elongated one -- for a substantial portion of the so-called \"Dreamers,\" young people brought to the country illegally by their parents and previously protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. But he has infuriated Democrats and immigrant advocacy groups by tying any potential protection for the Dreamers not only to funding for a border wall and enhanced enforcement measures but also substantial reductions in legal immigration.  ", "In the proposal that Trump is expected to highlight in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, the administration has insisted that any deal for \"Dreamers\" include severe limits on immigration aimed at family reunification -- what conservatives call \"chain migration.\" Trump wants to limit future legal immigration only to the spouses and minor children of American citizens and permanent legal residents. That shift could reduce legal immigration by as much as 40% over time, ", "according to projections by the Migration Policy Institute", ". Hard-line legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia in the House ", "would impose similar reductions on legal immigration", ", while Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, in legislation Trump has endorsed, have proposed an even deeper cut of 50%. Any of these would represent the biggest reduction in legal immigration since the 1920s. ", "The voters most resistant to immigration", "Both in the 2016 primaries and general election, Trump relied preponderantly on support from the voters most resistant to immigration. A majority of Republican voters supported building Trump's proposed border wall ", "in just two of the 20 states where exit polls measured sentiment", " on the question in GOP primaries. Yet that minority of Republicans supported Trump in such overwhelming numbers that they provided a majority of the votes he received in 18 of the 20 states.  ", "In the general election, the exit poll likewise found that just 41% of voters supported building the wall while a 54% majority opposed it. Yet once again Trump won such an overwhelming percentage among the minority that supported the wall (85% of whom voted for him) that they provided about three-fourths of all the votes he received, according to the exit poll.  ", "The share of voters who believed that all undocumented immigrants in the US should be deported, as opposed to receiving legal status, was even smaller: just 25%, according to the exit poll. Yet once again they voted for Trump in such overwhelming numbers (more than four-in-five) that this relatively small group provided about 45% of his total votes. ", "A reliance on the places with the least exposure to immigration", "Geographically the contrasts were equally pointed. In both Congress and the Electoral College, the GOP now relies predominantly on the places with the least exposure to immigration.  ", "According to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, in 2016 immigrants exceeded or equaled their 13.5% share of the national population in fourteen states. Trump won just three of them: Florida, Texas and Arizona. Hillary Clinton won the other 11, including eight of the top 10: California, New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, Nevada, Massachusetts, Maryland and Connecticut. ", "Overall, Clinton carried 16 of the 20 states where people born abroad constitute the largest share of the population. (Georgia was the only other state in the top 20 that Trump carried.) ", "Trump, in turn, dominated the places with fewer immigrants. He won 26 of the 30 states where immigrants constituted the smallest share of the population. (Minnesota, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine were the only exceptions.) In 19 states, immigrants comprise only one-in-every-20 residents or less. Trump won all of them except for Vermont and Maine. The states on the very bottom of the list for immigrant presence represented some of Trump's strongest: West Virginia, Mississippi, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Alabama, Kentucky and South Dakota.  ", "The same patterns persist in Congress. In the Senate, Democrats now hold 31 of the 40 seats from the 20 states with the highest share of immigrants. That number could increase after November's election: the Democrats' top two Senate targets are Republican-held seats in Nevada and Arizona, which are both among the nine the GOP controls in the high-immigration states. (Democrats have an outside chance at a third Republican senator on that list, Ted Cruz of Texas.) ", "By contrast, Republicans hold 42 of the 60 Senate seats in the 30 states with the smallest share of immigrants. And that number could rise as well after November. The GOP's top Senate targets this year are almost all Democrats from the low-immigration states, including Missouri, Indiana, North Dakota, Montana and West Virginia. (The one exception is high-immigrant Florida, where Republicans are optimistic that Gov. Rick Scott can oust Democrat Bill Nelson.) ", "In the House, the contrast is equally stark. Nearly 85% of House Republicans represent seats where the foreign-born share of the population lags below the national average. (In Goodlatte's seat, immigrants comprise only 5% of the population.) Over 60% of House Democrats represent seats where the foreign-born share of the population exceeds the national average. This divergence could widen as well in November. Many of the Democrats' top targets this year include suburban seats in major metropolitan areas with large immigrant populations, such as Orange County CA; Northern Virginia; Miami; and New Jersey. ", "Democrats do better, and Republicans less well, in states with more immigrants partly because the GOP has struggled so much in recent years with all minority voters, whether native-born or immigrant. But many pollsters also say that unease about demographic change in general, and immigration in particular, often is also greater among whites in the places that are the least directly affected by it.  ", "As ", "the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute reported", " in a nationwide study in 2016, \"Notably, areas of the country that have been historical centers of immigration hold the most positive views of immigrants.\" The most negative attitudes were expressed in the Deep South, Appalachia and parts of the Plains and Mountain States -- areas with generally fewer immigrants. ", "A new focus on legal immigration", "The demands from Trump and some GOP legislators in each chamber for cutbacks represent the GOP's first serious attempt to retrench legal immigration since 1996, after the 1994 landslide that swept the party to control of both congressional chambers for the first time in 40 years. That earlier push never generated much momentum: though the House Judiciary Committee approved cutbacks, one-third of House Republicans joined most Democrats to block them on the floor. Just 20 senators supported legal immigration reductions, with three-fourths of Republicans (including John McCain, Orrin Hatch and Mitch McConnell) voting no. ", "This time, with Trump's vocal support, the effort may accumulate greater support. Yet with the exception of Perdue, few of the Republican senators from the high-immigration states have shown much enthusiasm for a crusade to reduce legal flows. (Late last week, Florida's Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, without directly criticizing the call for legal immigration reductions, pointedly suggested that any legislative package on DACA should be focused narrowly on closely related issues.) ", "And the push at the national level to reduce legal immigration collides with the increasing interest among local officials, even in many Republican-leaning heartland communities, in recruiting immigrants to stem population loss, particularly among people in the prime working years of 25-64. ", "The list of cities participating in the non-partisan Welcoming America network, which works with local governments and non-profits to promote the integration of immigrants, testifies to the breadth of interest in attracting new arrivals. The coalition includes not only Seattle and Los Angeles, Austin and Boston, New York and Chicago-big places with a long-standing immigrant heritage.

There's nothing inherently wrong with the study, and the political scientists who worked on it are well-respected. Most Americans, though, don't rank Trump ", "as the worst president ever", ", even if most ", "disapprove of the job Trump is doing", ". ", "Indeed, there is good reason to be cautious in using this study of political scientists to determine what Trump's place in history is at this point or what it will ultimately be. Why?", "1. The survey respondents are not Trump friendly", "The majority of respondents (57%) self-identified as Democrats compared to just 13% who were Republicans. That 44-percentage-point split is about 35 to 40 points wider than what is found in the general public, according to polls ", "from Gallup", ". Given that Trump's approval rating nationally ", "among Democrats is in the single digits", ", it shouldn't be too surprising that his ranking among a very Democratic-leaning sample of political scientists is quite low. ", "Interestingly, the survey also found that Republican political scientists were also not fans of Trump. The 21 of them who took part in the survey (a small sample size to be sure) ranked Trump an average of 40th out of 44 presidents. In other words, the survey respondents didn't just hate Trump because he was a Republican. ", "These Republican political scientists probably aren't your normal Republicans, however. Although there is no reliable polling data that I'm aware of on Republican political scientists and their vote choice in 2016, I decided to take a look at how the precincts around some college campuses voted in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. I did so to get an idea of how these political scientists might have voted. Specifically, I looked at the precincts around Harvard University (", "Cambridge", "), the University of Alabama (", "Tuscaloosa", "), University of Michigan (", "Ann Arbor", "), University of North Carolina (", "Chapel Hill", "), University of Texas (", "Austin", ") and the University of Wisconsin (", "Madison", "). I chose these campuses because they are in different parts of the country. All of them, with the exception of Harvard, are also flagship state universities in states where Trump won the general election.", "Trump finished first in the primary in none of these areas. In fact, he never finished above 30% of the vote. Interestingly, Ted Cruz didn't win any of these areas either. Instead, John Kasich and Marco Rubio won them, despite the fact that neither of them won or even came close to winning any of the states these contests were held in. ", "2. These surveys are capturing a moment in time among a specific subset", "Keep in mind, those polled were a very specific segment of the population. They are \"current and recent members of the Presidents & Executive Politics Section of the American Political Science Association.\" The results could have been different if they polled historians, for example. ", "Just last year, C-SPAN ", "surveyed a group of", " ", "mostly historians", ". Now, Trump wasn't asked about in that C-SPAN sample. Still, there were some differences between the survey of political scientists and historians. C-SPAN found James Polk ranked 14th instead of 20th as the political scientists did. They put John Adams at 19th instead of 14th. Both of these differences occurred, even though neither Adams nor Polk has been president in over 150 years. ", "Even among political scientists, these surveys don't necessarily stay consistent. Ulysses Grant, who was president in the 1870s, rose from 28th in a 2014 survey of political scientists to 21st in this one. Andrew Jackson, who was president in the 1830s, fell from ninth to 15th. ", "What changed? There could have been different political scientists taking the survey. Some political scientists may have also changed their mind. Some zeitgeist factors could be in play: Grant was the recent focus of a widely acclaimed biography by \"Alexander Hamilton\" author Ron Chernow while Jackson's name has been on the chopping block for state-level Democratic fundraisers and possibly the 20-dollar bill. (Jackson, by the way, is a favorite of Trump's, so that could also be attention that hasn't helped him with this crowd.) In other words, popular opinion may have changed on presidents in a very short time for presidents who haven't been in office for over 100 years.", "3. Modern presidents are even more difficult to judge", "The single-digit movement among presidents who served more than 100 years ago is nothing compared to the last two presidents who have been out of office for more than five years. During his presidency, a 2005 ", "Wall Street Journal poll", " of professors gave George W. Bush a ranking of 19th. A ", "Siena College survey", " of presidential scholars just after his presidency in 2010 put Bush at 39th. The 2018 political scientist survey placed Bush at 30th.", "Likewise, Bill Clinton has seen major movement in his ratings. A ", "Wall Street Journal poll ", "taken during the Clinton presidency in 2000 put him at 24th. He rose to eighth in the aforementioned 2014 political scientist survey. He dropped to 13th in the most recent one.   ", "Now, each set of judges may have had good reasons to vote the way they did, but the fact that the ratings changed frequently and by a lot gives you an idea of the fragility of them. ", "The Trump administration still has years to go. Something could occur that ends up changing the course of history. Trump could end up being a disaster in most people's minds by the end of it. He could end up surprising some folks. ", "The bottom line is that we don't know what's going to happen. Just don't be surprised if you turn around in a few years and find that Trump's position in the presidential rankings has changed. "]},

The problem for Republicans: He doesn't seem interested in using his power for the party's good. ", "From labeling a top Democratic target a \"good woman\" to tacitly approving of his former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon's aggressive courtship of Republicans to run in the primary against sitting senators, the Trump factor is proving problematic as midterm election season heats up.  ", "Here's a look, more than a year out, at the 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties in the November 2018 midterms: ", "1. Nevada", "Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller ", "Primary date: June 12", "In a health care battle that hurt Republicans politically, Heller's reversals and contortions were uniquely damaging. ", "His maneuvers -- he was against one GOP health care bill, then for another one -- looked like a result of the pinch Heller is feeling from both sides. On the right, Danny Tarkanian -- 0-for-5 in the general election in his runs for office but 4-for-5 in Republican primaries -- says Heller hasn't sufficiently supported Trump. On the left, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen says he's been there when Trump and congressional Republicans needed him.  ", "Nevada was a rare swing state to go Hillary Clinton's direction in 2016. Heller only won by a nose in 2012 -- and the health care debacle makes this state the most likely to flip next year. ", "2. Missouri", "Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill", "Primary date: August 7", "Running for re-election as a Democrat in a state Trump won by 19 points is tough enough. Now, McCaskill faces the challenger national Republicans had hoped to recruit into the race: state attorney general Josh Hawley, who officially launched his campaign last week. ", "Worse news for McCaskill: At the outset, Hawley seems to have the backing of both the McConnell and Bannon crowds -- making a competitive primary that would siphon away resources less likely. ", "McCaskill starts from a major financial advantage. She raised nearly $3 million in 2017's third quarter and has $7 million in the bank, to Hawley's $820,000 third-quarter haul. Still, at this stage in the 2018 cycle, she looks like the Democratic incumbent in the most jeopardy. ", "So why isn't she first on the list? Because of this: You can't yet name a single tough vote Trump and congressional Republicans have forced her to take. It's a reality that helps every Democratic incumbent on this list.", "3. Arizona", "Incumbent: Republican Sen. Jeff Flake", "Primary date: August 28", "If the question was which senator is most likely to lose, Flake would be first -- by a lot. His support from Republicans has so thoroughly collapsed that the question that looms largest is simply whether he'll even appear on the ballot.   ", "Democrats have the candidate they hoped for in Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. But Arizona still favors Republicans, and whoever emerges from the GOP's primary will stand a chance at keeping the seat -- even if it's Kelli Ward, whose history of controversial statements would be fodder for endless attack ads. ", "For now, Ward is the only Republican running against Flake. And several groups' internal polls there show Ward crushing him. But the possibility of other candidates entering before the late-August 2018 primary, and the bigger question of Sen. John McCain's health, add heavy doses of uncertainty to this race. ", "4. Indiana", "Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly", "Primary date: May 8", "Donnelly is a ripe target: He gambled entering the 2012 race against Sen. Richard Lugar, got lucky when Lugar lost in a primary to state treasurer Richard Mourdock, and then hit the jackpot when Mourdock flubbed a question about pregnancies resulting from rape in a debate just before the election. ", "None of the leading Republican candidates this time around -- Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and state Rep. Mike Braun -- are likely to commit such a gaffe. ", "This is another race that features two major themes: (1) It's happening in a state where Trump cruised in 2016, and (2) Republicans are heading into what could be an expensive, brutal primary. ", "The first factor lands Indiana high on the list. The second one keeps it from climbing higher -- for now. ", "5. West Virginia", "Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin", "Primary date: May 8", "It's getting lonely for Manchin in West Virginia. ", "Trump won the state by 42 points. Then the governor who'd been elected as a Democrat stood with Trump at a rally and declared that he was becoming a Republican. ", "Manchin, a former governor himself, knows his state. He's played the politics of the Trump era well, playing footsie with the administration over a Cabinet post and sounding open to compromise on issues like taxes. Like every other Democrat on this list, he's helped by Republicans failing to make him pay any price at all for voting against their bills. But serious GOP challengers are lining up to take him on, and the D beside his name might be too much for Manchin to overcome in such a conservative state. ", "6. North Dakota", "Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp", "Primary date: June 12", "Want a 10-second explanation of why Trump drives Republicans whose job is to expand the party's Senate majority crazy?", "Cue up the tape of Trump, who had flown Heitkamp to his event in North Dakota in early September on Air Force One, pointing her out and saying: \"Everyone's saying: What's she doing up here? But I'll tell you what: Good woman.\"", "What better gift could Trump give a Democrat running for re-election in a state he won by 36 points? ", "Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer, who is thinking about challenging Heitkamp, was on stage for that moment, and got no special mention. State Sen. Tom Campbell is in the race. But Heitkamp raised more than $1 million in the third quarter, has almost $4 million on hand and the President seeming to like her is going to matter.  ", "7. Ohio", "Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown", "Primary date: May 8", "The 2016 election ended Ohio's status as the marquee swing state -- with Trump's eight-point margin of victory there making places like North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia look like potentially better targets for national Democrats. ", "When it comes to connecting with voters' sense of economic anxiety, the populist, anti-trade Brown has a lot in common with Trump. He also heads into a likely matchup against state treasurer Josh Mandel, who Brown already beat head-to-head in 2012. ", "This race should be a good test of whether Trump's popularity transfers to other Republicans -- or whether it was really his economic message that won the day in Ohio. ", "8. Montana", "Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester", "Primary date: June 5", "Tester is raising lots of money -- $1.2 million in the third quarter, with more than $5 million on hand -- and railing against \"Washington,\" not Trump. ", "Yes, Montana was a state Trump won by 20 points. But Gov. Steve Bullock also proved last year that a Democrat can win statewide here. And Republicans haven't yet been able to cast a man with a flat-top who still farms on the weekends as an out-of-touch liberal elitist. ", "The GOP primary bears watching -- in part because it's shaping up as a proxy war between interior secretary Ryan Zinke, whose wife is involved with Troy Downing's campaign, and Sen. Steve Daines, who is aligned with state auditor Matt Rosendale. ", "9. Wisconsin", "Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin", "Primary date: August 14", "Baldwin is all that's standing in the way of Republicans' total takeover of Wisconsin's statewide seats -- and she'll be on the ballot at the same time the engine that drove Gov. Scott Walker's victories in two gubernatorial races and a recall election is trying to win him a third term. ", "But the Republican primary field is unsettled. State Sen. Leah Vukmir and businessman Kevin Nicholson could pose serious challenges. ", "One big question: Was Trump's win in 2016 a surprise that'll quickly be reversed, or the tipping point in what had been Wisconsin's slow rightward drift? ", "10. Florida", "Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson", "Primary date: August 28", "This is all about Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who can throw tons of his own money into a Senate race that Trump and other party leaders desperately want to see him enter. If he does, this becomes a high-profile race in a marquee swing state, and has all the ingredients of a close, expensive and brutal contest. Scott's handling of Hurricane Irma -- and particularly a nursing home ", "where 12 patients died ", "-- would come under serious scrutiny. ", "For now, this race barely makes the cut. But if Scott gets in, expect it to jump much higher. ", "Honorable mention", "Two more Democrats, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, are among the safest swing-state incumbents. And Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow appears to be in good position -- though rap-rock musician Kid Rock (ballot name: Robert Ritchie) wants people to think he might run against her. ", "In New Jersey, Sen. Robert Menendez is on a different kind of hot seat -- in the middle of a corruption trial.  ", "If a true anti-Trump wave breaks against the Republicans, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could find himself in a competitive race against Rep. Beto O'Rourke. And whichever Republican is nominated to replace Sen. Bob Corker in Tennessee -- right now, Rep. Marsha Blackburn looks like the front-runner -- could face a tough test. ", "One that should be on your radar: Mississippi. Republican Sen. Roger Wicker is likely to face a Steve Bannon-backed primary challenger. State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who nearly knocked off Sen. Thad Cochran in a primary in 2014, is seriously considering the race. Democrats wonder if the GOP primary might turn this state into competitive ground just like Alabama, where controversial former judge Roy Moore faces a surprisingly serious competitor in Democrat Doug Jones in a December special election.

But the Senate, they thought, would have to wait for 2020. ", "Alabama could change all that.  ", "The Washington Post's report", " that Republican nominee Roy Moore alleged pursued teenage girls while in his thirties -- which Moore denies -- has led to a chorus of GOP senators conditionally calling on Moore to withdraw from the ballot ahead of the December 12 special election for Attorney General Jeff Sessions' old seat. ", "\"If these allegations are true, he must step aside,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. ", "\"The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. \"He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of.\"", "Moore has given no indication that he'll do so. Alabama law doesn't allow for him to be replaced on the ballot at this stage, anyway. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she talked to Sen. Luther Strange -- the Alabama Republican temporarily appointed to fill Sessions' seat, who lost a primary to Moore -- about running as a write-in candidate. ", "Moore was already on the record advocating discrimination. He has said homosexuality should be illegal and once wrote that Muslim people shouldn't be allowed in Congress. Those comments plus his removal -- twice -- as Alabama state Supreme Court chief justice has helped Democrat Doug Jones so far run a closer-than-expected race in a deep-red state.

After Tuesday's blue wave through the Virginia suburbs, Democrats are already incredibly optimistic about the 2018 midterms.", "2. Republicans face long, bitter primaries in nearly every state where they hope to knock off Democratic incumbents. And those Democrats haven't had to cast any tough, politically damaging votes since Trump took office. ", "3.

Kay Ivey is not endorsing Moore -- in accordance, her office said, with a self-imposed policy that began when she took the office in April -- but did plan to vote for him.", "Asked by CNN Thursday, after the Post story was published, if Ivey would still vote for Moore, a spokesman for Ivey said he was unsure.", "In a statement released later in the day, Ivey didn't address the question, but called the allegations against Moore \"deeply disturbing\" and said she would \"hold judgment until we know the facts.

Only after those are settled can the GOP fully turn its attention to unseating Senate Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections. ", "The across-the-board primary battles are complicating what should be a hugely advantageous map for Republicans. Democratic senators are running for re-election in 10 -- that's right, 10 -- states that President Donald Trump won in 2016. The GOP, meanwhile, only has two members who currently look like they could be in real jeopardy. ", "At stake is control of the Senate, where the GOP currently holds 52 of 100 seats. ", "Here is CNN's first Senate race ranking of the 10 seats most likely to flip in 2018: ", "1. Nevada", "Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller", "It's one of the earliest races to take shape -- and it's all bad news for Heller. ", "Danny Tarkanian, who has lost five campaigns over the last decade but won the GOP nomination in four of those five races, ", "is taking on Heller in the Republican primary", ". And Rep. ", "Jacky Rosen", " was hand-picked by Harry Reid to challenge Heller in the general election.   ", "Heller also cast a potentially damaging vote for the Senate GOP's health care bill, sticking with party leadership (and with Trump, who had said while sitting beside Heller at a meeting before the vote: \"He wants to remain a senator, doesn't he?\")", "Still, that vote could haunt Heller in 2018 -- particularly because it looked like a flip-flop after Heller stood weeks earlier with popular Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval at a news conference and denounced the House's version of the Obamacare repeal effort. He has also delivered confusing and contradictory answers on whether he supports Planned Parenthood funding. ", "The health care gymnastics complicate what already looked like a tough race. Heller was elected with just 46% of the vote in 2012. Four years later, Nevada was among the only swing states to favor Hillary Clinton over Trump. ", "2. Missouri", "Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill", "Missouri attorney general ", "Josh Hawley", " is moving toward a run against McCaskill. He's well-regarded by donors and operatives. And now that several Republicans who were widely expected to run, including Rep. Ann Wagner, have decided against entering the race, he could be looking at a clearer field. ", "Deepening Democrats' concerns is that Missouri is rapidly moving rightward. Trump won the state with 57% support last year, and Sen. Roy Blunt was re-elected despite Missouri secretary of state Jason Kander running perhaps the best Democratic Senate campaign of the entire cycle. ", "The Republican tilt and Hawley's status as a top-tier challenger make this perhaps the GOP's strongest pick-up opportunity. ", "3. Indiana", "Incumbent: Democratic Sen.

Luke Messer and Todd Rokita -- are likely to make such a mistake in 2018. ", "However, this primary battle will be nasty and personal.

Joe Manchin", "If you had any doubt about this state's heavily Republican leanings, Gov. Jim Justice erased it ", "when he switched parties ", "at a rally alongside Trump -- who carried West Virginia with 68% of the vote -- last week. ", "But Manchin isn't your average Democrat. ", "Perhaps more than any other senator, he was helped by Trump's victory. A world in which Manchin spent two years casting votes for a Clinton agenda would have put him in much graver danger than one where he has kept a cordial relationship with Trump and maintained his own centrist brand, while enjoying the freedom to oppose the GOP's politically unpopular health care effort.

Evan Jenkins", ", another party-switching former Democrat, and attorney general Patrick Morrisey -- whose wife's firm's lobbying work for Planned Parenthood and a pro-gun control group could become a target during an intense primary.", "5.

", "However, Heitkamp -- who hasn't officially announced she's running for re-election herself, but is fundraising like a candidate -- has $3 million in the bank, she's held events all across a state with a small enough population that retail politics works, and she doesn't have a Republican opponent. ", "The most buzzed-about prospects are state Sen. Tom Campbell and Rep. Kevin Cramer. But until one -- or another Republican with a profile in North Dakota and/or money to spend -- jumps in, Heitkamp is in a strong position. ", "8. Wisconsin", "Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin", "Unseating Baldwin didn't get any easier when Rep. Sean Duffy, perhaps Republicans' strongest potential recruit, decided against running. ", "So far, Marine Corps veteran and businessman Kevin Nicholson is in the race, while state Sen. Leah Vukmir, businessman Eric Hovde and others are weighing bids of their own.

Bob Casey is waiting to see how the Republican field shakes out in a state Trump narrowly won in 2016. Meanwhile, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was actually outraised by Democratic Rep.

", "1. Experts agree Cruz is heavily favored to win", "There hasn't been a lot of polling in the race (more on that in a moment), but observers mostly agree that Cruz is \"likely\" to win. That is, on a scale that goes solid to likely to lean to toss-up, Cruz's chances are more towards the \"solid\" than the \"toss-up\". This includes ", "CNN", " in its race ratings, which has the race as likely Republican.", "But just what exactly does likely mean? My old colleague at ", "FiveThirtyEight Nate Silver went back", " and looked at Senate races since 2010 to see how many times Senate races were won by the side that was \"likely\" to win in race ratings at this general point in the cycle. ", "The answer was 85% of the time. Now, saying that Cruz has an 85% chance of winning doesn't mean the race is over. It's approximately equivalent to a person tossing a coin three times in the air and it landing on heads each of those times. I'm sure you've seen that happen many times. Chances are, though, that it won't. ", "2. The fundamentals suggest Cruz is heavily favored", "When there's a general lack of polling, another way of determining the odds on a race is to look at the fundamentals. These include factors such as how the national environment looks (based on the generic ballot), whether the incumbent is running for reelection and the lean of the state on the presidential level (usually measured by examining the last two presidential races).", "While the generic ballot heavily favors Democrats, the other two factors don't. Cruz is an incumbent, and incumbents usually ", "receive an added boost", ". And remember, Donald Trump ", "won Texas by 9", ", and Mitt Romney won it by 16. In other words, it's still a heavily Republican leaning state as far as we know. ", "When ", "statistician Dean Strachan looked", " at these factors back in December, he gave Cruz an 84% chance of winning. That's quite similar to where the expert ratings put the race. A race O'Rourke could win -- though will probably not. ", "3. The scant polling that does exist favors Cruz ", "We have not had a non-partisan poll of the race that meets CNN standards in nearly a year. The two surveys that have been released in the past three months have been from a Democratic-leaning outside group and Cruz's own campaign. That doesn't leave us with a lot of confidence in the polling in the race. Still, both surveys had Cruz comfortably ahead -- and the average of the two gave Cruz a 14 percentage point advantage. ", "Until we get more surveys in the race, it's a little difficult to assess what exactly the polling is saying. Just remember that the January to June ", "polling average before the election", " in Senate races from 2006 to 2014 had an average error of 6.8 percentage points, and a 14 point lead translates into winning 95% of the time. If the average poll over the next few months looks anything like it does now, O'Rourke's got a long road ahead of him. Of course, maybe O'Rourke closes in on Cruz after his likely win in the primary. ", "4. The likely voter population leans Republican ", "A number of analysts have pointed out to ", "Gallup's 2017 polling", " to argue the race could be close. Gallup had Trump about as unpopular in Texas (approval rating of 39%) as he was nationally. ", "But as ", "I've noted before", ", Gallup's polling is of all adults. That's misleading to understanding the electorate in Texas. Trump's approval rating among voters is probably way higher. ", "Back in the fall of 2016, for example, Marist College polled nine states. They asked about then-President Barack Obama's approval rating. Democrat Obama's net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating) fell by 13 percentage points between the adult and likely voter population. That's more than any other state polled and more than twice the average state.  ", "The reason Republicans do better in Texas among voters is fairly simple. First, the state's voting population is 14 points more white than the adult population, according to the Current Population Survey. Nationally, the average state's voting population is about 7 points more white than the adult population. ", "Additionally, voting patterns difference between whites and non-whites is greater than it is nationally. ", "Those two factors make Texas far more Republican leaning than you'd expect looking a poll of all adults. ", "5. The special election signal ", "You might think that the special elections so far this cycle are a good sign for O'Rourke. To the degree that they suggest a national environment that ", "leans heavily Democratic", ", they are. ", "On the other hand, there's something worrying about the special elections for O'Rourke as well.  ", "The special elections have ", "followed a similar pattern", ": the 2012 presidential vote baseline has been far more telling than the 2016 presidential vote baseline. If that holds in Texas, it's a big problem for O'Rourke. The reason being that Texas was one of the few states where Democrats did better in 2016 than in 2012, even as the nation became more Republican leaning.  ", "What O'Rourke needs to win is for voting patterns to follow 2016, and then receive an additional boost on top of that. That's certainly plausible. The vote patterns in the ", "2017 Virginia elections", " looked a lot more like 2016 than 2012. But even there, Virginia Democratic candidates didn't do that much better than Clinton did in 2016.", "Put another way, O'Rourke is going to need pretty much everything to go right in order to win.

Ted Cruz.", "Excitement over O'Rourke's candidacy has been bubbling just below the surface for Democrats in Texas and Washington for a few months now, with optimism built, largely, on O'Rourke's fundraising ability and ", "President Donald Trump's surprisingly unimpressive poll numbers in the Lone Star State", ".", "Still, that optimism has been guarded -- largely because Democrats have been promising since at least 2002 that ", "this", " is the election where the changing face of Texas -- less white, more Hispanic -- gives them a real chance to win a statewide election.", "That optimism may be less guarded in the wake of this massive fundraising haul by O'Rourke.  But, raising oodles of money doesn't guarantee an O'Rourke win. (If money = victory, then Tony Sanchez would have been governor and Ron Kirk would be in the Senate.", " They aren't", ".)", "While O'Rourke's cash haul doesn't prove he's a sure-fire winner, it does reveal a few things about the race. Here are five.", "1. Democratic donors hate Cruz", ": Sure, O'Rourke is young, personable and handsome.  And, yes, Texas is a big state with", " lots and lots of donor money in it", ". But, a good chunk of O'Rourke's cash is the result of donors -- inside and outside of Texas -- who simply want to make Cruz sweat. Other than the current occupant of the White House, there's no Republican who Democrats hate more than Cruz -- largely as a result of his near-miss 2016 presidential campaign. That Cruz hatred among Democratic givers doesn't take away anything from O'Rourke; he saw the opportunity to run and capitalize on that dislike before anyone else did.", "2. O'Rourke has a much higher $$$ ceiling", ": The $6.7 million O'Rourke raised between January 1 and March 31 came from 141,000 donations. Some simple back of the envelope math means that the average contribution was around $50. (Obviously that's a broad estimate, not a hard-and-fast number.)  What it means is that O'Rourke should be able to go back to lots and lots of his donors and ask for more. (The contribution limit for an individual is $2,700 for the primary and another $2,700 for the general election.) The more he looks like he can be truly competitive, the easier that ask becomes.", "3. PAC money is overrated", ": When O'Rourke announced his candidacy, he pledged not to accept any donations from political action committees -- a move aimed at proving he wasn't part of the DC swamp. Most independent observers crushed him for that decision, insisting that the residual benefits he would get from being able to cast himself as un-owned by the permanent political class would be overshadowed by how much money he would be sacrificing. (Cruz has raised north of $580,000 from PACs.)  Turns out that O'Rourke hasn't needed PAC cash at all.", "4. O'Rourke isn't a creation of the national Democratic Party: ", "Per point No. 1, there's a tendency to assume that for any Democrat to raise the amount of money O'Rourke has that it must be coming from wealthy liberals on the two coasts who have cash to burn and just want to make Cruz's life difficult. Not so, at least as of February 18, the last day for which we have detailed information on O'Rourke's cash flow. (O'Rourke announced his fundraising through March 31 via press release but the actual report, which gives us a more detailed sense of where the money came from -- and how much of it he has left -- has yet to show up at the Federal Election Commission.)  As of that date, 49.99% of O'Rourke's donations came from inside of Texas with the remainder from outside the state. That's a healthy split that suggests O'Rourke is not simply a creation of national Democrats but has actual, on-the-ground support among Texans.", "5. This is a real race", ": Make no mistake: Cruz is still the favorite here. Texas remains a Republican state and despite what is expected to be a very good year for Democrats nationally, any credible GOPer starts with an edge over a Democrat in this state. That said, O'Rourke's fundraising will allow him to build a real voter identification and turnout effort statewide as well as battle Cruz on the TV airwaves. That doesn't guarantee victory. But it almost always ensures competitiveness."]},
