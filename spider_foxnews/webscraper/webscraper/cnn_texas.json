Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken is withholding his blue slip for David Stras. Stras currently sits on the Minnesota Supreme Court and was nominated in May for a seat on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.", "\"I do not think that the Senate should cede its power to the executive branch and end this long-standing custom,\" Franken said. Franken said he was minimally consulted by the White House on Stras' nomination, and was only granted two meetings with staff from the White House Counsel's office.", "\"In light of the White House's disrespect for the Senate's constitutional role, I voiced my objection using the only means available to me, by withholding my blue slip,\" Franken explained. Franken has previously said he objects to Stras' staunchly conservative views, issuing a lengthy statement explaining that he fears Stras' \"views and philosophy would lead him to reinforce those divisions and steer the already conservative 8th Circuit even further to the right.\"", "Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, moved forward with Stras' hearing Wednesday, explaining that he refused to treat blue slips \"as a single-senator veto.\" Democrats, however, pointed out that Grassley refused to hold hearings on ten of then-President Barack Obama's nominees from 2015 to 2016 because they didn't have two blue slips.", "Top Democrat on the committee Dianne Feinstein highlighted the apparent hypocrisy.  ", "\"The Democrats on this committee are simply asking for blue slips to be respected, just as they were for Republican senators,\" Feinstein said. \"All we ask is to be treated the same way in the Trump administration as Republican senators were treated in the Obama administration. No more, no less.\"", "Grassley defended his move, noting that previous Judiciary Committee chairmen have also moved forward with hearings in circumstances where two blue slips weren't returned. And then Grassley punched back, pointing out that Democrats, too, have bucked tradition.  ", "\"It's also revealing that these same colleagues and groups supported abolishing the filibuster for lower court nominees in 2013, a Senate rule that was more longstanding and established than my immediate predecessors' strict blue slip policy,\" Grassley argued.", "On the Senate floor Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell defended Grassley's move, saying blue slips should not be used to block nominees' consideration. ", "\"Perhaps our Democratic colleagues now feel buyer's remorse over the change to Senate Rules they jammed through this body. But they should not be allowed to use the committee's blue slip courtesy -- which is neither a committee rule, nor a Senate Rule -- as another way to block the consideration of nominees with majority support,\" the Kentucky Republican said.", "Republican Sen. Ted Cruz applauded Grassley's decision to move forward with the hearing despite Franken's blue-slip objection.  ", "\"I think your decision on the blue slips was exactly the right decision to make,\" Cruz said. \"Sen. Franken's public objections to him have been, not that he is unqualified, but rather that he's a member of the Federalist Society, that he's clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas and that he has said supportive things of Justice (Antonin) Scalia. I do not think that should bar the committee from considering his nomination.\""]},

", "\"At the end of the day, in a legislative body, you do the best you can with whatever opportunity you have to affect things in a positive way,\" Corker said. \"I'm glad we were successful (Tuesday) in getting this agreement. Hopefully it's going to be memorialized and part of the bill. I haven't voted for a piece of legislation yet that I thought was just outstanding. Well, maybe. But not many.\"", "Senators and aides are emphatic that the details of the trigger -- intended to increase taxes if the bill fails to generate enough economic growth -- are still very much in flux. There's division over whether automatic tax hikes should target the individual rates or the business side of the equation. After their Wednesday lunch, lawmakers also suggested that instead of the trigger setting off tax increases, it could instead require the party to cut discretionary spending.", "While most lawmakers aren't drawing any red lines at this point, there is widespread concern in the conference that the trigger could backfire if the country enters a recession. They also worry that the trigger could interject uncertainty into the tax bill, something that lawmakers say could undermine the underlying goal of generating growth.", "\"I am not going to draw lines in the dirt and I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican who had said a day previously that he would rather \"drink weed killer\" than vote for a bill that automatically increased taxes.", "Sen. Dean Heller, a Republican from Nevada, said, \"Personally I don't support triggers.\"", "\"I think it takes away the kind of certainty that you have to put in this bill,\" Heller said.", "Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said he favored a proposal offered by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas that would force additional tax cuts if the growth outpaced the party projections but that he didn't like the idea of automatically raising taxes. ", "The struggle for leadership now is a classic one: How can they find a way to appease the deficit hawks without risking the votes of Republicans who aren't keen on the provision the deficit hawks are making a key condition of their vote?", "Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can afford to lose only two Republican senators. There are three Republican senators -- Corker, Lankford and Arizona Republican Jeff Flake -- who have asked for assurances that the tax bill won't add to the federal budget deficit. ", "The trigger issue is only one of a few items that lawmakers are still working their way through just days ahead of an expected vote on the bill. Republicans are also looking at ways to give more tax breaks to pass-throughs, businesses that range from small stores to hedge funds and pass on their profits directly to the owner, who then pays taxes on the individual side. ", "Sen. John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota, said the party is working through a whole host of details but that in the end, the Senate passing the bill isn't the end of the road.", "\"Remember, this debate -- even once we pass a bill -- it still goes to conference,\" Hoeven said, where it must be reconciled with the House version of the legislation.

Of those 26 seats, 10 are in states that Trump carried in 2016 -- including five that he carried by double digits. (The reason Democrats are defending 26 seats instead of 25 is that Sen. Al Franken has promised to resign in the wake of multiple groping allegations and there will now be two Senate seats on the ballot in Minnesota.)", "A map like that is a once-in-a-lifetime dream for a party -- particularly when you already hold the majority. That's why, at the start of 2017, chatter was rampant in Republican circles that 60 seats -- and the filibuster-proof majority that goes with it -- was in the realm of possibility for Republicans.", "That idea feels far-fetched this morning as Democrats celebrate their Alabama victory and Republicans stare down the reality of a fractured party and a less-than-motivated GOP base. (On Tuesday night, Doug Jones got 92% of all votes that went for Hillary Clinton; Roy Moore won just 49% of the votes that Donald Trump did 13 months ago in Alabama.)", "And while Jones' victory, at its most basic, brings Democrats one seat closer to the majority, it has other more far-reaching effects as well. ", "It will put a major charge in Democratic fundraising -- for Senate races, yes, but likely for the House as well. It will also spur candidate recruitment for Democrats across the country in races from the Senate all the way down the ballot. You can just imagine a Democrat waking up this morning and thinking to herself: \"If Doug Jones can win in Alabama, why can't I run and win in [fill in the blank] state?\"", "Then there is the effect that Jones' win will have on Republicans. It's no secret that being a Republican elected official on Capitol Hill isn't much fun in the age of Trump. We've already seen a slew of retirements among the so-called \"governing wing\" of the GOP, including Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona as well as House members like Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida and Dave Reichert of Washington. That exodus is likely to continue or even speed up following what happened Tuesday in Alabama.", "Even before Tuesday Democrats already had some momentum in their unlikely push for the Senate majority next year. In Tennessee, former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, shocked most people in the state by announcing he would run for the open seat left behind by Corker. A popular two-term governor, Bredesen is, without question, the strongest Democratic candidate and likely the only one who could possibly win in this GOP-leaning state.", "Meanwhile, Republicans continue to have recruiting struggles in Democratic seats that were expected to be likely turnovers in 2018. In Montana and North Dakota, for example, Republicans have yet to land an \"A\"-type candidate. In Indiana and West Virginia, there are crowded primaries on the Republican side that will likely be nasty and expensive even before a dime is spent on the Democratic incumbents.", "And then there is the Steve Bannon factor. The former Trump White House chief strategist, who was one of Moore's most ardent backers in Alabama, has pledged to run serious primary challenges against every GOP incumbent on the ballot in 2018 (with the exception of Ted Cruz in Texas.)", "Bannon-backed primary challengers are already making life difficult for Republican incumbents, chasing Flake and Corker into retirement and leading Nevada Sen. Dean Heller to brag that he \"helped write\" a tax bill that's widely unpopular.", "Even Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump ally who was considered a sure thing candidate against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in 2018, sounded less certain about his plans in a chat with ", "CNN's Eric Bradne", "r last month.", "\"I don't know if I'm going to be a candidate,\" Scott said. \"We'll worry about that next year.\"", "It's hard to imagine that last night made Scott any more likely to run -- and could well have convinced him that waiting a few years might be the smartest course for his political future.", "To be clear: Democrats are not favorites to win back the Senate majority in 11 months' time. The map still clearly favors Republicans. But, thanks to Trump's historic unpopularity, the passion within the Democratic base and the malaise that appears to be creeping into their own base, Republicans who had assumed they would control the Senate well beyond the 2018 elections have to feel much more skittish about that prospect today.", "\"It really may be that the upper atmospherics will matter more than the map, that the Republican establishment's meek surrender to Trump costs it at least one house of Congress,\" concluded longtime Democratic Senate strategist Jim Jordan."]},

There's nothing inherently wrong with the study, and the political scientists who worked on it are well-respected. Most Americans, though, don't rank Trump ", "as the worst president ever", ", even if most ", "disapprove of the job Trump is doing", ". ", "Indeed, there is good reason to be cautious in using this study of political scientists to determine what Trump's place in history is at this point or what it will ultimately be. Why?", "1. The survey respondents are not Trump friendly", "The majority of respondents (57%) self-identified as Democrats compared to just 13% who were Republicans. That 44-percentage-point split is about 35 to 40 points wider than what is found in the general public, according to polls ", "from Gallup", ". Given that Trump's approval rating nationally ", "among Democrats is in the single digits", ", it shouldn't be too surprising that his ranking among a very Democratic-leaning sample of political scientists is quite low. ", "Interestingly, the survey also found that Republican political scientists were also not fans of Trump. The 21 of them who took part in the survey (a small sample size to be sure) ranked Trump an average of 40th out of 44 presidents. In other words, the survey respondents didn't just hate Trump because he was a Republican. ", "These Republican political scientists probably aren't your normal Republicans, however. Although there is no reliable polling data that I'm aware of on Republican political scientists and their vote choice in 2016, I decided to take a look at how the precincts around some college campuses voted in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. I did so to get an idea of how these political scientists might have voted. Specifically, I looked at the precincts around Harvard University (", "Cambridge", "), the University of Alabama (", "Tuscaloosa", "), University of Michigan (", "Ann Arbor", "), University of North Carolina (", "Chapel Hill", "), University of Texas (", "Austin", ") and the University of Wisconsin (", "Madison", "). I chose these campuses because they are in different parts of the country. All of them, with the exception of Harvard, are also flagship state universities in states where Trump won the general election.", "Trump finished first in the primary in none of these areas. In fact, he never finished above 30% of the vote. Interestingly, Ted Cruz didn't win any of these areas either. Instead, John Kasich and Marco Rubio won them, despite the fact that neither of them won or even came close to winning any of the states these contests were held in. ", "2. These surveys are capturing a moment in time among a specific subset", "Keep in mind, those polled were a very specific segment of the population. They are \"current and recent members of the Presidents & Executive Politics Section of the American Political Science Association.\" The results could have been different if they polled historians, for example. ", "Just last year, C-SPAN ", "surveyed a group of", " ", "mostly historians", ". Now, Trump wasn't asked about in that C-SPAN sample. Still, there were some differences between the survey of political scientists and historians. C-SPAN found James Polk ranked 14th instead of 20th as the political scientists did. They put John Adams at 19th instead of 14th. Both of these differences occurred, even though neither Adams nor Polk has been president in over 150 years. ", "Even among political scientists, these surveys don't necessarily stay consistent. Ulysses Grant, who was president in the 1870s, rose from 28th in a 2014 survey of political scientists to 21st in this one. Andrew Jackson, who was president in the 1830s, fell from ninth to 15th. ", "What changed? There could have been different political scientists taking the survey. Some political scientists may have also changed their mind. Some zeitgeist factors could be in play: Grant was the recent focus of a widely acclaimed biography by \"Alexander Hamilton\" author Ron Chernow while Jackson's name has been on the chopping block for state-level Democratic fundraisers and possibly the 20-dollar bill. (Jackson, by the way, is a favorite of Trump's, so that could also be attention that hasn't helped him with this crowd.) In other words, popular opinion may have changed on presidents in a very short time for presidents who haven't been in office for over 100 years.", "3. Modern presidents are even more difficult to judge", "The single-digit movement among presidents who served more than 100 years ago is nothing compared to the last two presidents who have been out of office for more than five years. During his presidency, a 2005 ", "Wall Street Journal poll", " of professors gave George W. Bush a ranking of 19th. A ", "Siena College survey", " of presidential scholars just after his presidency in 2010 put Bush at 39th. The 2018 political scientist survey placed Bush at 30th.", "Likewise, Bill Clinton has seen major movement in his ratings. A ", "Wall Street Journal poll ", "taken during the Clinton presidency in 2000 put him at 24th. He rose to eighth in the aforementioned 2014 political scientist survey. He dropped to 13th in the most recent one.   ", "Now, each set of judges may have had good reasons to vote the way they did, but the fact that the ratings changed frequently and by a lot gives you an idea of the fragility of them. ", "The Trump administration still has years to go. Something could occur that ends up changing the course of history. Trump could end up being a disaster in most people's minds by the end of it. He could end up surprising some folks. ", "The bottom line is that we don't know what's going to happen. Just don't be surprised if you turn around in a few years and find that Trump's position in the presidential rankings has changed. "]},

", "In the battle for control of both Congress and the White House, Republicans rely overwhelmingly on the places in the US that remain the least touched by immigration. Democrats depend primarily on the places with the most immigrants. ", "That contrast frames the inverse dynamic driving this volatile debate: generally it is the places with the least exposure to immigrants that are seeking to limit future migration, over the objections of the places with the most. ", "Even that paradox doesn't capture the full complexity of the conflict. At the federal level, Republicans led by President Donald Trump are now urging not only a crackdown on undocumented immigrants, but also the biggest reduction in legal immigration since the 1920s. But simultaneously, more local officials from both parties across the heartland are trying to attract immigrants they consider indispensable to their strategies for maintaining economic vitality and a critical mass of population.  ", "\"My sense is if you talk to local elected officials, policy makers, business owners, faith leaders, they get it -- they completely understand that immigration is what is going to keep them going,\" says Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, and author of the book \"There Goes The Neighborhood,\" which explores how communities across America are adapting to new arrivals. \"But, especially in this day and age, for them to make that case publicly, when the other bullhorn is held by the President, is really, really hard.\" ", "Trump would trade protection for \"Dreamers\" for drastic cuts in legal immigration", "Trump has disappointed some conservatives by indicating that he's willing to accept a pathway to citizenship -- albeit an elongated one -- for a substantial portion of the so-called \"Dreamers,\" young people brought to the country illegally by their parents and previously protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. But he has infuriated Democrats and immigrant advocacy groups by tying any potential protection for the Dreamers not only to funding for a border wall and enhanced enforcement measures but also substantial reductions in legal immigration.  ", "In the proposal that Trump is expected to highlight in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, the administration has insisted that any deal for \"Dreamers\" include severe limits on immigration aimed at family reunification -- what conservatives call \"chain migration.\" Trump wants to limit future legal immigration only to the spouses and minor children of American citizens and permanent legal residents. That shift could reduce legal immigration by as much as 40% over time, ", "according to projections by the Migration Policy Institute", ". Hard-line legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia in the House ", "would impose similar reductions on legal immigration", ", while Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, in legislation Trump has endorsed, have proposed an even deeper cut of 50%. Any of these would represent the biggest reduction in legal immigration since the 1920s. ", "The voters most resistant to immigration", "Both in the 2016 primaries and general election, Trump relied preponderantly on support from the voters most resistant to immigration. A majority of Republican voters supported building Trump's proposed border wall ", "in just two of the 20 states where exit polls measured sentiment", " on the question in GOP primaries. Yet that minority of Republicans supported Trump in such overwhelming numbers that they provided a majority of the votes he received in 18 of the 20 states.  ", "In the general election, the exit poll likewise found that just 41% of voters supported building the wall while a 54% majority opposed it. Yet once again Trump won such an overwhelming percentage among the minority that supported the wall (85% of whom voted for him) that they provided about three-fourths of all the votes he received, according to the exit poll.  ", "The share of voters who believed that all undocumented immigrants in the US should be deported, as opposed to receiving legal status, was even smaller: just 25%, according to the exit poll. Yet once again they voted for Trump in such overwhelming numbers (more than four-in-five) that this relatively small group provided about 45% of his total votes. ", "A reliance on the places with the least exposure to immigration", "Geographically the contrasts were equally pointed. In both Congress and the Electoral College, the GOP now relies predominantly on the places with the least exposure to immigration.  ", "According to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, in 2016 immigrants exceeded or equaled their 13.5% share of the national population in fourteen states. Trump won just three of them: Florida, Texas and Arizona. Hillary Clinton won the other 11, including eight of the top 10: California, New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, Nevada, Massachusetts, Maryland and Connecticut. ", "Overall, Clinton carried 16 of the 20 states where people born abroad constitute the largest share of the population. (Georgia was the only other state in the top 20 that Trump carried.) ", "Trump, in turn, dominated the places with fewer immigrants. He won 26 of the 30 states where immigrants constituted the smallest share of the population. (Minnesota, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine were the only exceptions.) In 19 states, immigrants comprise only one-in-every-20 residents or less. Trump won all of them except for Vermont and Maine. The states on the very bottom of the list for immigrant presence represented some of Trump's strongest: West Virginia, Mississippi, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Alabama, Kentucky and South Dakota.  ", "The same patterns persist in Congress. In the Senate, Democrats now hold 31 of the 40 seats from the 20 states with the highest share of immigrants. That number could increase after November's election: the Democrats' top two Senate targets are Republican-held seats in Nevada and Arizona, which are both among the nine the GOP controls in the high-immigration states. (Democrats have an outside chance at a third Republican senator on that list, Ted Cruz of Texas.) ", "By contrast, Republicans hold 42 of the 60 Senate seats in the 30 states with the smallest share of immigrants. And that number could rise as well after November. The GOP's top Senate targets this year are almost all Democrats from the low-immigration states, including Missouri, Indiana, North Dakota, Montana and West Virginia. (The one exception is high-immigrant Florida, where Republicans are optimistic that Gov. Rick Scott can oust Democrat Bill Nelson.) ", "In the House, the contrast is equally stark. Nearly 85% of House Republicans represent seats where the foreign-born share of the population lags below the national average. (In Goodlatte's seat, immigrants comprise only 5% of the population.) Over 60% of House Democrats represent seats where the foreign-born share of the population exceeds the national average. This divergence could widen as well in November. Many of the Democrats' top targets this year include suburban seats in major metropolitan areas with large immigrant populations, such as Orange County CA; Northern Virginia; Miami; and New Jersey. ", "Democrats do better, and Republicans less well, in states with more immigrants partly because the GOP has struggled so much in recent years with all minority voters, whether native-born or immigrant. But many pollsters also say that unease about demographic change in general, and immigration in particular, often is also greater among whites in the places that are the least directly affected by it.  ", "As ", "the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute reported", " in a nationwide study in 2016, \"Notably, areas of the country that have been historical centers of immigration hold the most positive views of immigrants.\" The most negative attitudes were expressed in the Deep South, Appalachia and parts of the Plains and Mountain States -- areas with generally fewer immigrants. ", "A new focus on legal immigration", "The demands from Trump and some GOP legislators in each chamber for cutbacks represent the GOP's first serious attempt to retrench legal immigration since 1996, after the 1994 landslide that swept the party to control of both congressional chambers for the first time in 40 years. That earlier push never generated much momentum: though the House Judiciary Committee approved cutbacks, one-third of House Republicans joined most Democrats to block them on the floor. Just 20 senators supported legal immigration reductions, with three-fourths of Republicans (including John McCain, Orrin Hatch and Mitch McConnell) voting no. ", "This time, with Trump's vocal support, the effort may accumulate greater support. Yet with the exception of Perdue, few of the Republican senators from the high-immigration states have shown much enthusiasm for a crusade to reduce legal flows. (Late last week, Florida's Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, without directly criticizing the call for legal immigration reductions, pointedly suggested that any legislative package on DACA should be focused narrowly on closely related issues.) ", "And the push at the national level to reduce legal immigration collides with the increasing interest among local officials, even in many Republican-leaning heartland communities, in recruiting immigrants to stem population loss, particularly among people in the prime working years of 25-64. ", "The list of cities participating in the non-partisan Welcoming America network, which works with local governments and non-profits to promote the integration of immigrants, testifies to the breadth of interest in attracting new arrivals. The coalition includes not only Seattle and Los Angeles, Austin and Boston, New York and Chicago-big places with a long-standing immigrant heritage. It also encompasses heartland communities where Republicans typically run better than in the big metros: Akron, Toledo and Dayton, Indianapolis, Lincoln and St. Louis, Kalamazoo and Fargo, Nashville and tiny Clarkston, Georgia.  ", "Noorani notes there is a \"dissonance\" between the push to attract immigrants in so many local communities, many of them Republican-leaning, and the escalating demands from national GOP leaders to roll back legal immigration. \"It doesn't mean that what's happening locally is easy, but at the local level, if you've got a good mayor, a good city council, the police chief, the fire department, who are speaking to the values of immigrants to a particular community, that eases the tension,\" he says. \"Right now, it's clearly not the President delivering that message.\""]},

The state's 7th congressional district has been in Republican hands since its lines were redrawn in 1966 by court order. Former President George H.W.

Ted Cruz and Democrat Rep. Beto O'Rourke are clear favorites to win their respective primaries. ", "So the bigger question after tonight is whether O'Rourke, who ", "outraised Cruz last quarter", " and has been ", "aggressively campaigning throughout the state", ", can ride a blue wave to victory in November.", "While O'Rourke certainly has a shot of winning, there are a number of reasons why Democrats should not get their hopes up. ", "1. Experts agree Cruz is heavily favored to win", "There hasn't been a lot of polling in the race (more on that in a moment), but observers mostly agree that Cruz is \"likely\" to win. That is, on a scale that goes solid to likely to lean to toss-up, Cruz's chances are more towards the \"solid\" than the \"toss-up\". This includes ", "CNN", " in its race ratings, which has the race as likely Republican.", "But just what exactly does likely mean? My old colleague at ", "FiveThirtyEight Nate Silver went back", " and looked at Senate races since 2010 to see how many times Senate races were won by the side that was \"likely\" to win in race ratings at this general point in the cycle. ", "The answer was 85% of the time. Now, saying that Cruz has an 85% chance of winning doesn't mean the race is over. It's approximately equivalent to a person tossing a coin three times in the air and it landing on heads each of those times. I'm sure you've seen that happen many times. Chances are, though, that it won't. ", "2. The fundamentals suggest Cruz is heavily favored", "When there's a general lack of polling, another way of determining the odds on a race is to look at the fundamentals. These include factors such as how the national environment looks (based on the generic ballot), whether the incumbent is running for reelection and the lean of the state on the presidential level (usually measured by examining the last two presidential races).", "While the generic ballot heavily favors Democrats, the other two factors don't. Cruz is an incumbent, and incumbents usually ", "receive an added boost", ". And remember, Donald Trump ", "won Texas by 9", ", and Mitt Romney won it by 16. In other words, it's still a heavily Republican leaning state as far as we know. ", "When ", "statistician Dean Strachan looked", " at these factors back in December, he gave Cruz an 84% chance of winning. That's quite similar to where the expert ratings put the race. A race O'Rourke could win -- though will probably not. ", "3. The scant polling that does exist favors Cruz ", "We have not had a non-partisan poll of the race that meets CNN standards in nearly a year. The two surveys that have been released in the past three months have been from a Democratic-leaning outside group and Cruz's own campaign. That doesn't leave us with a lot of confidence in the polling in the race. Still, both surveys had Cruz comfortably ahead -- and the average of the two gave Cruz a 14 percentage point advantage. ", "Until we get more surveys in the race, it's a little difficult to assess what exactly the polling is saying. Just remember that the January to June ", "polling average before the election", " in Senate races from 2006 to 2014 had an average error of 6.8 percentage points, and a 14 point lead translates into winning 95% of the time. If the average poll over the next few months looks anything like it does now, O'Rourke's got a long road ahead of him. Of course, maybe O'Rourke closes in on Cruz after his likely win in the primary. ", "4. The likely voter population leans Republican ", "A number of analysts have pointed out to ", "Gallup's 2017 polling", " to argue the race could be close. Gallup had Trump about as unpopular in Texas (approval rating of 39%) as he was nationally. ", "But as ", "I've noted before", ", Gallup's polling is of all adults. That's misleading to understanding the electorate in Texas. Trump's approval rating among voters is probably way higher. ", "Back in the fall of 2016, for example, Marist College polled nine states. They asked about then-President Barack Obama's approval rating. Democrat Obama's net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating) fell by 13 percentage points between the adult and likely voter population. That's more than any other state polled and more than twice the average state.  ", "The reason Republicans do better in Texas among voters is fairly simple. First, the state's voting population is 14 points more white than the adult population, according to the Current Population Survey. Nationally, the average state's voting population is about 7 points more white than the adult population. ", "Additionally, voting patterns difference between whites and non-whites is greater than it is nationally. ", "Those two factors make Texas far more Republican leaning than you'd expect looking a poll of all adults. ", "5. The special election signal ", "You might think that the special elections so far this cycle are a good sign for O'Rourke. To the degree that they suggest a national environment that ", "leans heavily Democratic", ", they are. ", "On the other hand, there's something worrying about the special elections for O'Rourke as well.  ", "The special elections have ", "followed a similar pattern", ": the 2012 presidential vote baseline has been far more telling than the 2016 presidential vote baseline. If that holds in Texas, it's a big problem for O'Rourke. The reason being that Texas was one of the few states where Democrats did better in 2016 than in 2012, even as the nation became more Republican leaning.  ", "What O'Rourke needs to win is for voting patterns to follow 2016, and then receive an additional boost on top of that. That's certainly plausible. The vote patterns in the ", "2017 Virginia elections", " looked a lot more like 2016 than 2012. But even there, Virginia Democratic candidates didn't do that much better than Clinton did in 2016.", "Put another way, O'Rourke is going to need pretty much everything to go right in order to win. It can happen, but it's a long shot. "]},

The 64% of Republicans who identified as conservative in the 2016 General Social Survey are not statistically significant different from the 65% who said they were in 2008.

An all-time low of 35% of Americans called themselves conservative. ", "The change in the Democratic electorate has been reflected well in its nominees for president. As an example, look at the difference between Bill and Hillary Clinton. When Bill Clinton first ran for president in 1992, 38% of Americans said he was liberal in a CBS News/New York Times poll and 42% of them said he was liberal in a Gallup survey.

He remembers how passionate Kennedy became, telling him then that the issue was something his family championed in Congress for 50 years. ", "And that issue earned Kennedy national attention during the health care debate when he delivered an emotional speech that went viral. During a marathon committee markup on the GOP's Obamacare repeal and replace bill, Kennedy ripped House Speaker Paul Ryan personally. He took issue with the fellow Catholic's interpretation of the scripture and calling the measure an \"act of mercy.\" Kennedy denounced the proposal to repeal and replace Obamcare as an \"act of malice.\"", "When asked about the role younger members can play, Kennedy won't criticize Pelosi, calling her \"one tough lady and one tough leader.\" And he cautions against pigeon-holing someone because of their age. ", "\"We have to be disciplined enough not to prejudge because somebody is an older socialist from Vermont, that they can't necessarily speak to the hopes and aspirations of a coal miner, a farmer, a college student, a millennial that loves avocado toast,\" Kennedy said.", "***", "Even before he arrived on Capitol Hill, Moulton was a party renegade. In the 2014 midterms, he challenged Rep. John Tierney, an 18-year veteran backed by Pelosi.", "He gained national headlines for being the first to oust an incumbent that election cycle, and again in 2016 when he publicly called for Pelosi to step down from leadership to make way for newer Democrats to chart the party's future. He backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan's challenge to Pelosi's status as minority leader. He notes that while Ryan failed in that effort, he still got 63 votes in the secret election. Of those, only Moulton and roughly a dozen others have gone public.", "Hoyer, who years ago had his own leadership battles with Pelosi, said Moulton's moves remind him of himself. Before he came to Congress, Hoyer was the youngest president of the Maryland state Senate.", "\"I'm not so old that I can't remember being a Young Turk myself,\" Hoyer told CNN, adding about Moulton, \"he's sees himself as an agent of change.\"", "Hoyer works closely with Pelosi now. But he praises Moulton as \"very bright, very energetic\" and a top messenger on national security issues. Moulton's military service comes up a lot in an interview in his Longworth office in between votes recently. It's what he says exposed him to people from all walks of life and economic levels, and instilled a desire to continue in public life after his four combat tours in Iraq.", "\"My battalion motto in the Marines was 'whatever it takes,' and I'm going to do whatever it takes to help win back the House in 2018,\" Moulton told CNN.", "He was recently tapped, along with California Democratic Rep. Jimmy Panetta and Florida Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy, to head a task force to educate House Democrats about foreign policy and defense issues.", "\"That's a sign that he wants to be a deep thinker and wants to be a big player. And I think it was smart for him to do something like that,\" Bustos said.  ", "The Illinois Democrat was part of the trio -- along with Moulton and Ryan -- invited to headline the annual \"steak fry\" fundraiser in Iowa in September. She said she values his counsel on defense issues, but acknowledged that his tactics inside the caucus, such as his challenge of Pelosi, have caused some friction. ", "\"People who talk publicly about leadership and the need for leadership change, that's going to ruffle some feathers,\" Bustos said.", "While Moulton, 39, may criticize Pelosi, he is doing the same thing she did to propel her stock among her colleagues: Raising big bucks for fellow Democrats as they prep for the next election.  ", "He created his own political operation that recruits and mentors candidates who served in the military or have service backgrounds. He says he saw a hole and decided to take on a veterans' candidate program, and he worked with an outside group, VoteVets, to partner with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to ensure these types of candidates were getting attention.", "Moulton's colleagues have taken notice of the impressive $600,000 he's raised, plus $300,000 for his own re-election campaign. ", "He told CNN his goal is to formally recruit and back two dozen veterans through his political group -- the same number Democrats need to win back control of the House.", "Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, who heads the DCCC, praised Moulton for zeroing in on the need to focus on fellow veterans.", "\"He has brought in a spirit of he's willing to speak up and stand up and say what needs to be said based on what he believes, that is in the best interests of his constituents and the people he is fighting for,\" Lujan said. ", "Moulton's speech in Iowa earlier this fall didn't hold back on the challenge facing his party. He said while Americans in communities across the country were struggling economically, Democrats were \"in the worst position since the 1920s to do anything about it.\" ", "He pointed to losses both at the national and local level and used them as evidence of his central theme: \"That means that we've got change to make. That means that we can't just keep doing the same old thing and expect to win again. We've got to get back to our party roots. We've got to get back in touch with those voters that we have lost, because the reality is that a lot of Americans feel left behind -- not just by the Republicans, but by our party, and by our country.\"", "In his Washington office, Moulton says part of the reason he's helping bring candidates in and support them is because he's worried other Democrats aren't creating the environment to foster more people to get engaged in politics.", "\"I think there is a lot of chaos right now and that's a sign that there's a leadership vacuum,\" he said.", "He said he doesn't pretend to have all the answers, but says the focus on veterans is his \"niche.\" While he offers his own take on the kinds of issues and economic message he believes is important he says it's too early to be telling voters what matters in the next election.", "\"We need to be in listening mode for our party right now as Democrats, not in preaching mode,\" he said.", "Asked about the congressional Democrats' recent roll out of a message campaign offering voters \"a better deal,\" Moulton again breaks with his own leadership.", "\"A better deal sounds like we're talking about the same deal that everybody has today and we're just going to make it better,\" he said. \"The economy is changing too fast for that. We need to be talking about the future, that's part of why I'm talking about a new generation of leadership and recruiting all these young people to run for Congress.\"", "He says he's working with the DCCC and his own effort to flip more red seats in the House, but adds, \"We've got to have a message, we've got to have a vision and it's going to be hard to win if we don't have new leadership.\"", "Not surprisingly, Lujan, a close ally of Pelosi's, disagrees with Moulton's criticism of the top House Democrat. And he appeared to issue what might be a warning to Moulton about any additional effort to push her out.", "\"You need to be able to learn to count to get there and I think that is a skill set that more people need to fully appreciate and clearly leader Pelosi has understood the importance of counting, if you will. Not just to get bills passed, but with leadership votes as well,\" Lujan told CNN.", "Drew Hammill, Pelosi's spokesperson, accused Moulton of grandstanding.", "\"Leader Pelosi enjoys widespread support in the House Democratic Caucus,\" Hammill told CNN in a statement. \"The few who take potshots in order to get booked on TV are merely a distraction from the goal of retaking the House majority. Leader Pelosi will not be deterred from her mission of winning the House back for the American people.\"", "Moulton appeared annoyed when pressed on whether he's taken on Pelosi to garner more attention for his own political profile and says he's not getting any blowback from colleagues.", "\"The number of Pelosi allies who have come to me and told me to back off, that I'm not doing the right thing is exactly zero,\" he says, adding, \"the number of members of the caucus who voted for her, who have checked to see who was listening and then patted me on the back and then said 'keep going Seth, you're doing the right thing' is literally dozens.\"", "Like Kennedy, Moulton has also collaborated with Republicans in the House. After the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 and injured hundreds, he teamed up with Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo on legislation to ban bump stocks, the accessories that can convert a firearm into an automatic weapon.", "Even though there was a similar bill offered by top House Democrats, he decided to get behind the version with Curbelo. \"I just think it's the only realistic way to do anything when you are in the minority,\" Moulton said.", "Oklahoma GOP Rep. Steve Russell, also a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, has traveled overseas with Moulton. Russell told CNN their politics are polar opposite but they share a \"warrior bond.\" ", "The two created the \"warrior caucus\" a group of roughly 30 House members who served in combat, and try to find military readiness issues to work on together.", "\"One of the things that I like about Seth is that he is intellectually honest, he won't retreat to a partisan corner as a matter of course,\" Russell said. \"He may not commit to something without further study, but he's willing to engage and dialogue.\" ", "***", "As with any up-and-coming politician, the conversation about Moulton and Kennedy quickly turns to the future. ", "Moulton made clear he didn't want to talk about any political positions in the years to come.", "\"I think it's a huge mistake for people in the party to be thinking about 2020,\" he said. \"If we can't figure out how to win in 2018, we're going to be a mess in 2020.\"", "When asked about taking a run at a top leadership post in the House after the midterms, Moulton says, \"I'm not going to write it off, but it's truly not what I'm thinking about.\"  ", "The former Marine grew noticeably irritated when pressed about prospects for a Senate bid if one of his colleagues retires or runs for another office, or whether his Iowa trip or work on a new book about public service are precursors for a national campaign down the line. He says he was invited to Iowa because the organizers of the annual event were looking for \"people who are trying to breathe new life into the party.\" But he said spent the bulk of his time at the event \"with a Miller Lite in one hand and an open hand to meet more people.\"", "Meanwhile, former Rep. Patrick Kennedy believes his cousin has the credentials to move up if he decides he wants a career beyond the House.", "\"There's just no question that if he sticks to doing what he's doing now that every one of the options that have been mentioned that are not only a possibility, but a reality,\" he said.", "Joe Kennedy shrugs off questions about whether he has designs beyond his current House seat.", "\"If a Senate seat were to come open, yeah it's something I'd take a look at,\" he said.

While campaign aides have an incentive now to distance themselves from the controversial firm, they insist they had misgivings about Cambridge early in the campaign -- even if they didn't follow through on them.

And they say the Trump team never bought into the so-called \"psychographic method\" Cambridge chief executive Alexander Nix was peddling to US political campaigns.", "Trump campaign officials including Parscale were more complimentary about the firm's role immediately following the 2016 victory. During a December 2016 forum hosted by Google, Parscale inferred that Cambridge provided a much-needed infusion of data staff for a bare-bones campaign.", "Parscale noted that \"Cambridge actually provided a full time employee that could sit next to me all day\" and help digest data.", "Cambridge didn't comment for this story, but has rejected Channel 4's reporting as edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of the conversations that took place. It has also denied misusing Facebook data, saying in a March 17 statement that the firm \"only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly.\"", "Courting the Trump campaign", "Armed with a polished sales pitch, Nix was looking to sell the novel \"psychographic method\" to GOP presidential hopefuls during the 2016 campaign. In theory, Cambridge could wrap in data from Facebook and other sources to model someone's personality type and suggest how they could best be swayed. ", "Nix was a slick salesman promising phenomenal returns. But he was a salesman, not a scientist.", "Data experts who saw his presentation said they were dubious of the science behind the product. Political operatives had their own concerns: Data security and wariness about the firm's work with multiple campaigns simultaneously.", "In spite of those reservations, GOP hopefuls had a compelling reason to bring Cambridge on board. Robert Mercer, a Republican megadonor, had invested $5 million in the data company. Knowing the Mercer family would continue to be a force in GOP politics, campaign operatives didn't want to do anything that would alienate them. ", "Mercer didn't comment for this story. ", "Cambridge began courting the Trump campaign early on, making at least three unsuccessful overtures in early 2015 and 2016, according to a source familiar with the conversations. In the meantime, Cambridge inked deals with the presidential campaigns of Carson, now the secretary of housing and urban development, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, according to Federal Election Commission data and campaign operatives.", "It wasn't until the summer of 2016 that Cambridge caught traction in Trump Tower. One of Parscale's campaign bosses encouraged him to reach out to Cambridge for help building a general election-style data operation.", "Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner suggested that was at his direction in a post-campaign ", "interview with Forbes magazine", ".", "\"Because we had to ramp up for digital fundraising. We brought in Cambridge Analytica. I called some of my friends from Silicon Valley who were some of the best digital marketers in the world,\" Kushner told Forbes last year.", "Parscale came away from his initial meeting in June 2016 hoping to poach one of Cambridge's data gurus, according to a source familiar with the encounter. Instead, the two entities struck a deal. The Trump campaign signed on with Cambridge Analytica and brought five staff members to San Antonio, where Parscale's own outside firm, Giles Parscale, was based and where much of the Trump data operation was actually located.", "The firm was brought on over the objection of several campaign aides and consultants, who were familiar with the kind of psychographic profiling that Cambridge had done for the Cruz super PAC and other political groups. Some thought the profiling was flawed, particularly because Cambridge did a poor job incorporating basic voter behavior data, such as whether a voter participated in the previous caucuses or primaries.", "At the time, the Republican National Committee was still reeling at the prospect of long-shot candidate Trump becoming the GOP nominee. Trump campaign officials were looking for a backstop in case the RNC failed to throw the weight of its fundraising and data operations behind Trump in the general election.", "The campaign tapped Cambridge to build out a database of small-dollar GOP donors, a dataset the company had from its prior work for the Cruz and Carson campaigns.", "As the summer rolled on, it became clear the RNC would offer Trump its full backing, with a promise to share data and other get-out-the-vote information that it had been building for years.", "It was also becoming evident internally that Cambridge's data models weren't particularly reliable, according to campaign sources involved.", "In late summer 2016, campaign officials pitted a Cambridge model against one from the RNC. The goal was to identify potential Trump supporters. Both models relied on the same raw data set from the RNC, according to two former campaign officials. But the RNC's outcome was far more accurate.", "\"Cambridge failed miserably,\" one former campaign official said. \"At that point it was sort of like, OK, the emperor has no clothes.\"", "But in the Google forum in December 2016, Parscale said Cambridge ultimately became involved in daily polling for the campaign, known as tracking polls, helping supplement the two other sets of polling data that he would examine at any one time. It helped streamline the decision-making process so the campaign could determine where to invest its resources. ", "Cambridge also used RNC data to build data visualization tools that helped determine where to send Trump for campaign rallies, according to a source familiar with the arrangement.", "All told, the Trump campaign paid Cambridge just under $6 million, according to FEC records. The largest payment to Cambridge Analytica - $5 million on September 1, 2016 - was made about two weeks after Steve Bannon was appointed the chief executive of the Trump campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records. One former campaign official said it was for a television ad buy. ", "Bannon recently fell out of favor with the Mercer family after his critical comments about the President and his family members in Michael Wolff's book \"Fire and Fury,\" which was published earlier this year.", "But Bannon once enjoyed a close relationship with the Mercer family. He had served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge from June 2014 to August 2016, according to a financial disclosure report that he filed with the federal government after joining the Trump administration. Among his assets, he listed a stake with Cambridge worth between $1 million and $5 million. The income section of the disclosure form also said Bannon's consulting firm received $125,333 from Cambridge.", "It's unclear whether he reaped any benefits from the $5 million ad buy. But Cambridge apparently botched that too, according to people familiar with the situation. When commercials started appearing on television in liberal Washington, D.C., the campaign decided to move its ad buying to a different firm, according to senior Trump officials.  ", "Bannon didn't respond to requests for comment for this story.", "The flawed psychographic method", "Over and over again, Cambridge failed to live up to its own hype, according to political operatives who worked with the firm.", "When Nix approached the Carson campaign, he touted his product as an opportunity for Carson to target his grass-roots supporters and build a small-dollar donor base. After Carson officially jumped into the race, the campaign compared the return it was getting from Cambridge with its other fundraising networks.", "\"It's fair to say that we probably could have used the white pages - the phone book - and gotten a higher rate of return than we did with the expense of working with Cambridge,\" said Watts, who worked as the communications director for Carson's presidential campaign in 2015.  ", "Still, the campaign continued to use Cambridge's services throughout 2015 and into early 2016. It paid the firm roughly $438,000, according to FEC records.", "The firm was working with Cruz's campaign over the same period. In a similar head-to-head test, Cambridge's voter modeling program failed up against the campaign's internal data operation.", "\"They may have believed it was accurate. I never believed it was accurate,\" a former Cruz official said of Cambridge's psychographic models. \"It's far more useful to me to know whether you voted in Republican or Democrat in the 2016 primary versus whether you liked Taylor Swift on Facebook.\"", "The Cruz campaign decided it would design its own voter algorithms going forward. But it kept working with Cambridge and paid the firm $5.8 million over the 2016 cycle, according to FEC records. ", "Officials from both the Cruz and Trump campaigns said the firm gave them access to sharp data scientists who could contribute to their operations even if the campaigns weren't using the company's psychographic product.", "Within the campaign, Parscale was viewed as an innovative thinker who was particularly skilled at using Facebook data, for instance, to target and contact specific voters. He also had little regard for Cambridge's suite of psychographic products.  ", "\"I don't think it's sinister,\" Parscale said in an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" last year. \"I just don't think it works.\"", "In the post-campaign forum hosted by Google, Matt Oczkowski, the head of product for Cambridge - and the operative Parscale was initially looking to poach - said the Trump campaign did not embrace the psychographic techniques the company used. ", "\"I don't want to break your heart, but we actually didn't really do any psychographics with the Trump campaign. I personally did woefully little on the digital side as well,\" Oczkowski said. \"Mostly I just helped manage the goat rodeo.\""]},

", "For a look at Trump, ", "click here.", " (CNN)", "A former first lady, senator, and secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has lived in the public eye for parts of five decades, emerging now as the first woman to be the presidential nominee of a major American party. To many, though, Clinton remains an inscrutable figure -- a trailblazing feminist icon in some corners, she has long been a target of scorn and suspicion from her political opponents.", "Carl Bernstein's book, \"A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton,\" is widely considered the definitive biographical exploration of Hillary Clinton's life and career. Bernstein interviewed more than 200 people for the book, published in 2007 and 2008, and his findings seem as relevant today as they were when she was running her first campaign for the White House eight years ago.", "CNN.com sat down with Bernstein to capture some of his perspective.", "This interview has been edited and condensed.", "CNN: Who is the real Hillary Clinton? And how did you come to write this book?", "She's the most interesting woman, I think, of our era. At the time -- she was already the most famous woman in the world. More famous than Princess Diana. More famous than Elizabeth Taylor. And, you know, we forget -- with Donald Trump, we remember what a celebrity he is and how the key to him is celebrity and celebrity culture. But it also is, in many ways, to Hillary Clinton as well. She is, very much, the most celebrated woman in the world. And it has a lot to do with her story -- and how she is judged, often not in context, but the way superstars in popular culture are usually judged: black and white, great or awful.", "Also, going back to the impetus for writing the book: I was fascinated after the impeachment [of President Bill Clinton] by the story of Hillary Clinton. Here was this person who had never run for public office before. She had been the first lady. She had never lived in New York state, where she was running for the United States Senate. The retiring incumbent senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a giant in the U.S. Senate, did not like her; and he was angry at her because she, in his words, \"demonized\" members of Congress too often for his taste, beginning with the health care experience. And so I just thought, \"This is one of the great stories. But underneath, there's a whole story we know nothing about.\" And we didn't really know about Hillary Clinton's life, which is what I found out in doing this book. Particularly when I went back to childhood. She has now been in public life for more than 40 years. She's this familiar figure. She's been in this bubble, which also has to do with who she is -- both the political bubble, the Washington bubble, and a media bubble for 40 years.", "So the extent to which she's out of touch with things, which has been demonstrated in this campaign, is not incidental to who she is. She hasn't really driven a car in over a quarter century. But she is someone who has lived her life as an adult being judged. And that has affected very much who she is.", "We're talking about a great human drama here. And I think that's another thing that gets lost with Hillary Clinton, in our easy caricatures: She's a human figure. And immensely subject to the hurts and pains that all the rest of us feel. She might put up a pretty good impression of being unaffected and simply looking at all this through a political lens, but no. She's a wife, too. ", "In \"A Woman in Charge,\" you wrote about three pillars that describe the life of Hillary Clinton. What are they?", "Big surprise. Family, religion, and public service. And those commitments are real. There is nothing fake about them. And they inform everything she does and has done. I'll give you one quick example. When she was in the White House and being vilified by particularly conservative Republicans, she was going to prayer breakfasts with the wives of many of those far-right conservative Republicans. And she never let it be known that she was going to those prayer breakfasts. The same when she became a senator. She went to the prayer breakfasts with many of the Republican senators who had voted to convict her husband. Her Methodism is absolutely essential to understanding who she is. She carries a Bible with her, and reads it in cars and on planes. She underlines passages. She knows it. She's looking for parables.", "But on the next to last page of the book, I noted that, \"Since her Arkansas years, Hillary Rodham Clinton has had a difficult relationship with the truth ... Through one crisis after another in a life creased by personal difficulties and public and private battles ... a fierce desire for privacy and secrecy seems to cast a larger and larger shadow over who she is.\"", "What do we know about Hillary's childhood? How did her upbringing impact the kind of woman and the kind of leader she would become?", "Hillary's father was a difficult, sour man, given to exaggeration and fantastical pronouncements about his own life. He was a misanthrope. He really disliked people and tried to isolate himself from other people outside his family. He made it very difficult around the house. He was sullen, tight-fisted, contrarian, authoritarian, given to rage. He had been a drill sergeant in World War II. And he ran his household like a drill sergeant. Boot camp. If one of the kids, Hillary or her two brothers, left the toothpaste cap off the tube, in the Chicago winter, he would throw it out into the snow and tell the kids to get down on their hands and knees and find the damn thing.", "But really, what was the worst aspect, for Hillary, as well as for her mother, was her father's abuse of his wife. The verbal abuse, diminution, disdain that in many ways he showed for Hillary's mother. And it really was extreme. It made it difficult for Hillary to bring friends into the house. They would sit at the dinner table. Hillary, her father, her brothers, her mother. Her father, again kind of like the drill sergeant, would throw out a topic for conversation at the dinner table, go around the table, and ask everyone their opinions. Until it got to Hillary's mother. And he would then say, \"What do you know, Miss Fancypants? You don't have anything to contribute to this.\" And he would go on diminishing her, and she would get emotionally upset and leave the table. And then he would say, \"Go ahead. Just don't let the screen door hit your ass on the way out.\"", "This happened numerous times. Very early in my research on the book, I was able to find and have lengthy conversations with Betsy Johnson Ebeling, who had never talked to any reporters or the press and had been Hillary's closest friend as a girl. And she described the atmosphere in this household and the abuse to which Dorothy Rodham, Hillary's mother, was subjected.", "The real question, as Betsy and others asked, is, \"Why didn't her mother leave her father?\" Dorothy would never say, \"That's it. I've had it,\" Betsy told me. And, of course, that's a shrink's dream, and I'm not a psychobiographer. But I think when you lay out the story as I do of Hillary's childhood, you get a sense of this remarkable girl, dealing with these things in her home. Her mother teaching Hillary, \"Look, if the boys knock you down, you get up, dust yourself off, and, and you go back up to bat.\" Her father, despite the difficulties, actually saw in Hillary an extraordinary young woman who would not be restrained by the fact that she was a girl. But he was harsh, and imposed impossible expectations on her -- telling her when she got a B on a report card filled with A's that she could have done much better. At various times, he didn't want her to get her driver's license, said she could ride a bike instead, and didn't want her to go on dates with boys even though her friends went on dates with boys. He held her back in certain ways.", "There's a terrific anecdote you outline in the book, about Hillary and her mother Dorothy Rodham that sheds some light into the early lessons that helped shape her character.", "Dorothy Rodham gave Hillary the example of a carpenter's level, and showed her how it worked early on, and said that's how she needed to focus on her life. She held out the level, with the bubble going back into the middle to illustrate the notion of righting yourself as a person when things get off balance and then coming back to center so that you can function. And that is a kind of metaphor, I think, for Hillary's life. She is really amazing at resetting the bubble, and going to that place in the middle, and shutting out the noise when she has to, and trying to stay in that level place while the world around her, including immediate proximity, is going wildly off balance.", "Dorothy Howell Rodham is the real hero and inspiration of Hillary's life. Dorothy's childhood was a horror of abandonment by her own parents --at age 8. Her way to cope was to persevere always. And, eventually, to make a home for her family in the midst of familial adversity. Like Hillary, she had a deep streak of rebelliousness and they shared a wicked sense of humor. And she was a secret Democrat; Hillary's father -- called \"Mr. Difficult\" by his wife -- was a self-described rock-ribbed conservative Republican who despised labor unions, opposed government aid programs, fulminated against higher taxes, and spoke in epithets about black people.", "By the time Hillary Rodham graduated from Wellesley College in 1969, it was clear she was no ordinary student. What do we know about her college years?", "One of the things that's important to understand and remember in terms of the dynamic between Bill and Hillary Clinton is that she was the better known and celebrated of the two when they met at Yale Law School in 1970.", " ", "She had given a commencement speech the previous June at Wellesley College at the height of the anti-war movement that drew great national attention to her. The scheduled commencement speaker was Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, the first black senator since Reconstruction, a Republican, for whom she had worked as a campaign volunteer. By the time of her graduation, the anti-war movement had swept through the campuses of America. Martin Luther King had been assassinated a year before.", "Campuses were being taken over by students and it was decided at Wellesley that a student speaker should also be chosen by the student body. They chose Hillary, who was president of her class, to be the speaker. First, Brooke spoke and was condescending and patronizing towards the anti-war movement and the young people in America who were transforming the country and our politics; he was dismissive of the anti-war movement and backed the war without much thought to the consequences.", "So Hillary threw aside her prepared speech and gave a response and a rebuke to Brooke, saying that she and her generation had been patronized too long by such attitudes as he expressed in this rather thoughtless speech of his, and that she could not stand there in good conscience and let this moment pass without saying that this was really out of order.", "The speech drew tremendous response, and resonated in the press, and Life magazine featured a profile of her very prominently. So that when Bill Clinton met Hillary at the Yale Law School, he knew who she was. She was famous, and there had been stories about how she was going to", " ", "move ahead in the political process and maybe even be President of the United States some day.", "You spoke before about the importance of religion in Clinton's life, her Methodism. How does that inform her politics -- how does it drive her?", "To start, when she was a teenager, a youth minister, age 26, came to her Methodist congregation in Park Ridge, Illinois. Reverend Don Jones. He was something of a radical minister who preached not just the gospels of Christ but also stressed the teachings of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, and his admonition to \"do all the good you can, whenever you can, wherever you can, to all the people you can, as long as you ever can.\"", "For Jones, this meant, among other things, reading the poetry of T.S. Eliot and the lyrics of Bob Dylan, and taking these young people in his congregation to hear Martin Luther King speak in Chicago. And one of the things you must understand about Hillary Clinton: the theme of race and her commitment to undoing the horrors of racism in this country going back to our founding, and understanding the role of race in our culture -- just as Bill Clinton does --  this is who she is. It goes to her core beliefs about what kind of people we are. And say what you will about other aspects of political life or character, but this is a constant that really does and should, to some extent, define her.", "So she found a comfort in the church and in Jones' youth ministry. The gospels of Christ, the service of Christ, and Christ's teachings about the poor, about helping neighbors -- she took them very, very literally. There will, of course, be those who say, \"Well, you know, she uses this as an excuse to do the things that her opponents think are untoward or unsavory.\" But that's really a separate question.", "Many people assume that Hillary really went to Arkansas to hitch her wagon to his ascent. But you discovered something that really turns that on its head. And it happens very early in their life together.", "It's another amazing thing -- why and how she finally decided to go to Arkansas. I mean, I was astounded when I learned this. She had failed the D.C. bar exam.", "She had never revealed it for 25 years or so that she had failed the bar exam. She had intended to stay in Washington after working on the Nixon impeachment investigation of the House Judiciary Committee and go to work for a big D.C. law firm, and probably specialize in children's defense law, which she had devoted her life to up to that point and still is devoted to. It's one of the best aspects of her character and her empathy. Part of it comes from her mother's experience and abandonment as a child.", "And what happens? She failed the D.C. bar exam. Not one of the more difficult bar exams in the country. I'm sure she felt humiliated by it. Lots of people fail the bar exam the first time they take it. They have a bad day. But she hid the fact from others for all those years. Those who knew her the absolute best, including Diane Blair, probably her closest friend. When I said to Blair, \"Did you know that Hillary had failed the bar exam?\" she looked at me like I was out of my mind.", "And so, to explain what really happened in this period: Bill Clinton had wanted her to come to Arkansas, but she wasn't heading that way. She was heading to a big Washington law firm and wanted Bill to join her in the capital. She took the bar. She failed it. And then she decided, \"Okay. I'll go to Arkansas.\" And she did.", "We know how the Clintons matched-up romantically, but how did they align ideologically and politically in those early years?", "In a letter to Rev. Jones from Wellesley, Hillary asked whether it was possible for one to be, \"a mind conservative and heart liberal.\"", "No description of Hillary Clinton -- a mind conservative and a heart liberal -- has so succinctly defined her as this observation she made about herself at age 18.", "She is very conservative in her own beliefs about personal things. About fidelity. About loyalty, and family. Yet she seems almost incapable of introspection. And this, of course, gets to the question about the anger she carries, which so many friends and associates discussed with me as an essential component of understanding her. You can't get beyond the thread of anger in her life. She's not the happy warrior that Bill Clinton is. However, in private with her friends, she is fun, girlish, and mischievous and shows no difficulty letting her hair down. One other aspect: She is a great and caring friend, and the stories are legion about notes she has written (with no possible ulterior or political motive) to friends and strangers about their trials and tribulations and triumphs.", "Bill Clinton is the intellect. He was then and is now a conceptual thinker. Hillary is much more an executor who synthesizes the ideas of others -- and acts on them. She is very much a pragmatist. Obviously Hillary's anger at her husband has marked their marriage. And at the same time, this is a great love affair. It might sound strange -- but anyone who knows them understands that. For almost half a century now, each has seen the other as the brightest star in the other's universe. And that continues to be the case. It's been an uninterrupted dialogue since they met -- about ideas, about the world, and the possibilities of politics in behalf of the ideals they share.", "Arkansas. It's a long way from Yale. Or Chicago for that matter. How did Hillary adjust to her husband's home state?", "It was a backwards Southern place in terms of her outlook and familiarity, with what was going on in other parts of the country when she moved there. And she immediately took action to begin building a women's movement in Arkansas, including establishing rape crisis centers, opportunities in politics for women, and somewhat defiantly she used her maiden name -- \"It showed I was still me,\" she said -- until Bill Clinton had to run for reelection as governor and it had become a political issue. Aides thought that might cost him politically, so she went back to using her married name. She seethed at the press for making it an issue. He lost, thought his political career was over, and went into a deep depression that lasted months, so wounded that Hillary thought he might never recover. Chelsea was less than a year old, and they had to move out of the Governor's Mansion, into a tiny apartment. Within days, Hillary took charge and never again let go of his political destiny. She became the architect of his political resurrection, planning the battle to regain the governorship in two years, persuading Bill to adopt more flexible, pragmatic positions on issues that had figured in his defeat. ", "On Chelsea's second birthday -- the day he announced he would run to regain the governorship -- Hillary presented him with a framed picture of the three of them, with the engraving, \"Chelsea's second birthday, Bill's second chance.\" That campaign became the model for their political future, with Hillary assuming a dominant, hands-on role in terms of policy, strategy, scheduling, and hiring staff. He won. And she began taking on substantive portfolios in his administration: education reform, to start.", "And when she went to the White House, and she made that famous statement, \"I'm not gonna just sit around and bake cookies all the time.\" Her heroine was Eleanor Roosevelt, who had broken so many barriers, both as First Lady and in terms of the work she had done, in terms of human rights, civil rights, women's rights. So this, too, goes to who Hillary Clinton is.", "How did Hillary Clinton handle the reports of her husband's infidelity while she was first lady of Arkansas? ", "Shortly after Hillary arrived in Arkansas, before they were married, Bill decided to run for Congress -- and had an affair with a student volunteer in the campaign. Hillary, who assumed a major strategic role in the race, ran the young woman off -- had her banned from campaign headquarters. Even then, his political opponents  were waging a whispering campaign about  his affairs, especially as election day neared. (Bill lost, by 2 per cent of the vote.) Rumors, amplified because he was considered a political comer who might someday run for president -- and some affairs -- continued through his terms as governor.", "In 1987, he and Hillary discussed the possibility that he would seek the Presidency in the '88 election; and when Gary Hart was forced to drop out of the race because he'd been caught in an affair, Bill tentatively decided he would run; Hillary and Bill summoned old friends to Little Rock for the expected announcement of his candidacy; a hotel ballroom was booked for the event. And, after talking with friends on the eve of the announcement and at the urging of his chief of staff Betsey Wright, who went through a list with him of women who might \"come out of the woodwork\" during a campaign, Bill decided not to run, saying he heeded \"some family time. Some personal time.\" Hillary seemed relieved on one level on and angry on another. It was anything but certain there would be such clear opportunity again to possibly win the White House.", "But perhaps the most threatening event to Bill's political future occurred in 1990, when he decided to seek a fifth term as governor, in a race that  looked very close. Four weeks before the election, his political opponents -- you could call them the vast right-wing conspiracy -- initiated a lawsuit alleging that he had maintained a slush fund as governor that he used to entertain five women with whom he supposedly had sexual relationships. The suit was obviously intended not just to hurt Clinton in Arkansas, but to derail any future presidential race, as Hillary understood. ", "And it named the five women, among them Gennifer Flowers. And so how did Hillary Clinton respond? Here is perhaps the template for so much that happens later. According to Betsey Wright and others, she and Hillary arranged that Webb Hubbell and Vince Foster -- her partners at the Rose Law Firm -- be hired, by or through the campaign, to represent the women and obtain their signed statements that they had never had sex with Bill Clinton. Some of the women were brought into an interview room to be interrogated by Vince, Webb, and on one occasion Hillary. Two of the women were prominent friends of Bill and Hillary -- both black, and thus adding to the incendiary nature of the allegations; and almost no one familiar with the case believes they were anything more than friends. Acting through another lawyer, Wright said she was able to get Gennifer Flowers to sign a statement that she had never had a sexual relationship with Bill.", "Now, toward the end of his gubernatorial period in Arkansas, Bill Clinton fell in love with another woman named Marilyn Jo Jenkins. And the damage from that was considerable within the marriage. This was a woman who did not meet the easy and condescending \"trailer trash\" criteria that Hillary applied to some of the other women, whom she chose to denigrate for their supposed lack of accomplishment or sophistication. This was a rich and successful businesswoman, with a graduate degree, whom Hillary recognized as different. And Bill was not secretive about the affair. Betsey Wright tried to keep the woman from coming around the office and confronted Bill numerous times about it. Hillary learned about it. And Bill Clinton decided that he wanted to leave the marriage. But Hillary refused. Bill told Betsey Wright that Hillary  would fight to keep her marriage and family together. That she had put too much of her own heart and mind and soul into their partnership to abandon it. And ultimately Bill Clinton decided not to leave the marriage.", "Until then, Hillary Clinton had never seriously contemplated running for office. Now, she and and Bill briefly toyed with the idea of her running for governor instead of him in 1990, while he worked on the marriage and relationship with his family. Ultimately, Dick Morris, their polling guru, determined that she did not have enough separate identity from Bill to run and win -- which infuriated her.  ", "But she didn't run for governor. She didn't leave her husband. She followed him onto the campaign trail and to the White House. And you wrote that she essentially saved his White House bid by the TV damage control she did when the Gennifer Flowers story broke.", "You have to factor that into what Hillary Clinton carried around in her head as a result of Bill's relationships with other women. You get to the campaign for president in 1992, and Gennifer Flowers resurfaces with a story in The Star tabloid saying she and Bill had had an affair which went on for twelve years. ", "Part of Hillary's response was to go after her as trailer trash, a term she used in private to describe Flowers. Hillary had also wanted in that campaign to go after President George Bush, the elder, for supposedly having had some affairs with women, without knowing whether or not there was real substance to it. There's no question that Hillary wanted to do that, through surrogates. But in the case of Gennifer Flowers, Hillary's initial instinct, when Bill again denied the affair to her, was to \"tell them (the press) the truth and get this off our backs.\" Then Flowers provided lurid details and claimed she had tape recordings. \"If we don't turn this into a positive, we're going down,\" said Paul Begala, one of the campaign's principals. He and others convinced Bill and Hillary the way to save the campaign was for them to appear together on an extraordinary broadcast of \"60 Minutes\" after the 1992 Super Bowl. And it worked. Hillary was worried she might cry on the air. This television appearance seemed to captivate its vast audience. ", "\"Who was Gennifer Flowers?\" Steve Kroft asked. \"How would you described your relationship?\" \"Very limited,\" said Bill. He and Hillary talked on camera about how they loved each other, how much they cared for Chelsea and how they had stayed together through the kinds of \"troubles\" most married couples encounter.  ", "From the beginning there was no question Hillary was Bill's biggest defender from other women causing trouble and how to handle them. As I wrote in the book: \"Always. It was as if she, much more than he, better understood the danger -- to him, to her, to Bill's future, and their dream. She never doubted that if the women, and the enemies who used them, succeeded or became too visible and credible, the whole edifice could come down, including their marriage.\" On \"60 Minutes,\" she said: \"I'm not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. I'm sitting here because I love him and I respect him.\"", "In the book, you raise the notion that the Clinton administration was in many ways a co-presidency. What do you mean by that?", "It was a co-presidency. And I think there's reason to think if there is another Clinton presidency, it too will be a co-presidency. Because each is -- and was during the first Clinton presidency -- the dominant influence on the other. Intellectually and in terms of their individual areas of strength and expertise.", "They really are fused after all these years. And you have to look at the Clinton presidency in many areas. You have to look at it in terms of economic policy, health care, women's rights, foreign policy, reading the mood of the country. But you also have to look at it in terms of the relationship of the Clintons to the Washington establishment, which was very distant. From the beginning, Hillary wanted nothing to do with the, quote, \"Washington establishment.\" We see something of the same in the Obama presidency in his reluctance to socialize with members of Congress and other power brokers in the town.", "But Hillary set the Clintons back in terms of their relationship with the traditional power structure of the town. Much to the disadvantage of the Clintons, as soon as they got there, she kind of drew a line in in the sand, saying, \"We're going to be outsiders, as it were, even though we're the President and first lady.\" And she had a wise social secretary who wanted to take her in exactly the opposite direction, who wanted a real integration in which the Clintons would win the goodwill of the permanent Washington class. They never did. It was a big problem and Hillary really initiated that.", "The Republicans in Congress certainly didn't support a co-presidency, and Hillary Clinton suffered a stinging defeat when her advocacy of health care reform failed. How critical a loss was that for her?", "If we look at an historic event that changed the direction of the country and its politics in the last decade of the 20th century, it's the election of the Gingrich Congress in 1994. And the election of that Congress can be largely attributed to the antipathy directed at Hillary Clinton by the electorate as a result of her actions as first lady during the health care fight. The secrecy. The alienation of Democratic friends. The political clumsiness. She became the issue to a disproportionate extent in that congressional election and, as a result, she was exiled, in effect, from her husband's own White House.", "Did Bill want to see her exiled? No. But he didn't have much choice. She became the issue and had to really leave the White House in terms of not only a portfolio, of health care or some substantive aspect of the Clinton presidency, but in terms of dealing with his aides. They shut her out. What did she do? She reinvented herself, decided she wanted to travel around the world, talk about women's issues. She went to China, gave an amazing speech in China about women's rights being fundamental human rights, and became an ambassador on behalf of women and the causes of women, and the civil liberties and civil rights of women and girls. It was an extraordinary accomplishment. And this goes back to her mother's lesson about picking herself up after getting knocked down.", "The former first lady coined the phrase \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" to describe her opponents. Was there in fact a concerted right-wing effort to undermine the Clintons?", "You know, she said Monica Lewinsky was about the vast right-wing conspiracy, and she said the same damn thing about the email server. Yes, the \"vast right-wing conspiracy,\" in some way, exists. The far-right wing is out to get the Clintons and to destroy what they see as Clintonism. And they have they been, as I say in the book, since the 1990s. But that's part of the cultural warfare that the country has been engaged in. The Clintons have been in the crosshairs of that cultural war for some 35 years now. Nonetheless, there's a way to factually separate the enemies from her own self-destructive actions.", "And what has happened with the email server is not a product of the enemies. It might be a response in her mind to thinking, \"I have to protect myself from the enemies, from the press, from the, quote, 'vast right-wing conspiracy,'\" both in setting up the server and lying about it. But that's no justification for the actions she took.", "Let me cut to the chase here. I think it is very important that we look at Bill and Hillary Clinton in terms of the cultural warfare in this country in our politics and our media of the last 35 years. They are the central actors to some extent in the culture wars. They are the Antichrist of the other side. And they -- you know, you look at what Barack Obama has faced from the Republicans. Vicious opposition. Some of it racist, some of it not. But you look at the kind of opposition that he has faced and you also have to look at it as an extension to some extent of what the Clintons have faced. And what happened to exacerbate the cultural warfare and make it even higher velocity, heavier artillery, was Bill Clinton's affairs with women. Once that became part of the political debate about Bill and Hillary Clinton, then you had a new set of circumstances.", "The Republican right has always looked at the Clintons as radical leftist demons -- exemplars of the ultra-liberalism the right despises, even though Bill and Hillary Clinton are more conventional center-left in their politics. Hardly radicals. And their enemies became even more enraged after Bill survived impeachment and Hillary went on to the Senate and then candidate for president. The Clinton presidential legacy, in tatters after impeachment, was redeemed after its enemies had thought \"Clintonism\" was dead. Redeemed largely by Hillary.", "Of course, it was at the Rose Law Firm that Vince Foster became a close friend and confidant, years before committing suicide while employed as a deputy White House counsel. Much has been written about Hillary Clinton's relationship with Foster, and about the circumstances of his death. What is the truth?", "Well, first of all, she was a woman partner in a major law firm in Arkansas, which was unusual. And a person in the firm I think whom she most identified with -- there were two, Webb Hubbell and -- the other was Vince Foster. And he became her great, great friend. And he was also a pretty good lawyer. And he came to Washington to be part of the Clinton administration and to work with Hillary on health care, especially.", "But then came the travel office controversy, in which an old friend of the Clintons convinced them that the White House Travel Office, which handled millions of dollars a year arranging flights for reporters and executive branch personnel traveling with the President and first lady, was being mismanaged and should be investigated by the FBI for embezzlement and fraud. Meanwhile, largely at Hillary's behest, suspect Travel Office employees were fired and a Little Rock firm was hired to run the office -- with a twenty-five year-old cousin of Bill Clinton's in charge. Vince Foster knew what had transpired in the travel office controversy and was going to be asked about that imminently by the FBI and probably in congressional investigations instigated by Republicans. He also had witnessed Hillary's mismanagement of healthcare and was responsible for defending it legally. And he was deeply depressed, partly because Hillary had been very rough with him in previous days, fuming that the defense of her and her staff and others in the White House in the travel office matter had not been sufficient. And he was in charge of organizing that defense.", " And in fact in the travel office affair, once again, she had been less than truthful. George Stephanopoulos, the White House press secretary at the time, privately referred to Hillary's pattern of \"Jesuitical lying.\" She was deeply involved in the travel office upheaval. And she did not want to say that she was deeply involved in it. And it was during this time that Vince Foster committed suicide. And there was the question of his records and what would happen with his records and certain billing records, which went around like poltergeist before they eventually ended up at the Williams, Connolly law office -- the Clintons' lawyers. The suicide of the person that she was closest to on the White House staff shook her profoundly, and she blamed the press for driving Foster to kill himself.", "Now, Donald Trump has outrageously thrown out there the idea that there was a murder or that Vince Foster did not commit suicide, which is pure bullshit. He committed suicide. And every investigation, and there've been some very good ones, has shown it. And it's Trump at his absolutely lowest and most irresponsible.", "In your book, you report that Bill Clinton confided to friends that he did not think his presidency would survive the first week of the Lewinsky scandal. What about his marriage? What was Hillary's response in those early days?", "The day after the Lewinsky story broke in the press, Bill Clinton said to someone I interviewed, a major Washington Democratic player, \"I don't l believe that I can last the week in office: I think that the cry for my resignation is going to be such that I will have to resign before the end of the week.\" But he managed to get to the end of the week. Though he probably would not have gotten much farther; I think we now have a pretty good idea of that. What then happened was that Hillary Clinton, on the following Monday, went on the \"Today\" show and gave connubial credence to his denials, saving Bill Clinton's presidency -- again.   ", "Hillary Clinton, interestingly enough, had believed Bill Clinton when he told her he had not had sex \"with that woman.\" He didn't just tell the country that. He told Hillary that. And she believed it up until days before his testimony to the special prosecutor months later. And even then he didn't go to her and tell her it was true. Instead, his lawyers had to go to Hillary several days before Bill testified and tell her, \"Yes, the allegations were true.\" But she had convinced herself, unlike her brothers, unlike her best friend Diane Blair, perhaps unlike even her mother, that the allegations against her husband were not true and that Monica Lewinsky was a stalker. So once again, this pattern emerges: of blaming the other women as those who are at fault in these relationships, along with political enemies.", "You say she saved his presidency. How did she do that?", "It's worth looking at the video of the \"Today\" show. And again, she said there was no truth to the allegations about this woman being involved sexually with her husband, that it was part of a vast right-wing conspiracy, which was, in essence, back to what she had alleged before -- with Gennifer Flowers, and those five women in Arkansas. That the enemies of the Clintons were responsible for the allegations. \"I do believe that this is a battle,\" she said. \"The great story here for anybody willing to find and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.\" ", "As one of her aides told me, \"She doesn't look at her life as a series of crises but rather a series of battles...she would much rather play the woman warrior -- whether it's against the bimbos, the press, the other party, the other candidate, the right-wing. She's happiest when she's fighting, when she has identified the enemy and goes into attack mode.\"", "In her ongoing explanation of her problems caused by her email server, there are many similarities to what she said on the \"Today\" show 18 years ago, especially about all the incoming fire she and her husband have taken in their long political lives and stood up to, and framing the allegations in the context of their enemies' aggression.", "And it was true that the enemies were involved in pushing the stories about other women out there. The Clintons' enemies had produced this lawsuit about the five women. And it's true that in the case of Lewinsky, their enemies, Lucianne Goldberg and others, had been deeply involved in trying to get this story out. But most importantly, many of the allegations were true.", "This time Hillary went on the \"Today\" show and said, \"There's no truth to this -- this is going to be shown to be part of the vast right-wing conspiracy.\" That, and then the stories about Monica Lewinsky being a stalker. And then the whole White House campaign to discredit her. And of course it became part of the special prosecutor's investigation.", "How does a sitting first lady who has never run for elected office decide to make a bid for Senate in New York state?", "Part of it was about redemption. I open the book with the scene of the day that Bill Clinton is being tried in the Senate of the United States. Hillary is meeting in her study at the White House with Harold Ickes, her political guru, with maps of New York State spread out, and looking at New York State to see whether it's possible that she can possibly win the Senate, while at that exact moment in the Senate chamber her husband is being judged and acquitted of high crimes and misdemeanors.", "Well, that's a pretty amazing scene when you think about it. She is the main reason that Bill Clinton was not convicted. She was able to marshal the impeachment defense -- on constitutional grounds -- in such a way that the Democrats stayed with him.", "And it made this look to their minds, to some extent, like a political witch hunt or certainly something that was nothing approaching the same standard of high crimes and misdemeanors as Nixon's transgressions, which they weren't. But they're apples and oranges also. And so she ran for the Senate, seeking redemption, redemption of their political journey together, redemption of their reputation, redemption of all of the good things that happened during the Clinton presidency.", "It was a pretty successful presidency in many regards. Look at the economy. Look at the number of jobs created. Look at the economic situation. Look at the deficit that was reduced, et cetera, look at a foreign policy that kept us out of disastrous warfare.", "Did she distinguish herself in the Senate? How will history remember Hillary Clinton the senator?", "She was not a distinguished senator in terms of any important legislative role, but she certainly received more attention in the press than any other senator. And she learned a lot, a good student as always. The first thing was she decided, was that \"I, Hillary Clinton, will not be a bull in the china shop.\"", "Well, think about that. That's fairly unusual for Hillary Clinton. And she decided, \"I'll become really close to Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader. And I'm gonna learn the rules and take his advice and sit quietly in my seat. And then I also am going get to know my Republican enemies.\" She had some advantage here because she already knew some of them through the prayer groups. But she also treated them with great deference and respect. And on small-bore bills unrelated to great national questions and matters, she joined with them in sponsoring things. She was not an important senator, in terms of the destiny and direction of the country except on one question: the biggest of all, the Iraq war.", "How important is the Iraq War vote to her Senate legacy?", "It was the most consequential vote that she made. It was the most consequential act of her being a senator. And she came down on the wrong side, and partly for cynical reasons. Some perhaps not. She also is very sympathetic to Presidents of the United States and their powers, and that Presidents need to have the inherent powers to go to war. But she also didn't do her homework, which is very unlike Hillary Clinton. She didn't read the briefings that she should've read, that would've shown that there was much less information to back up George Bush's claims about weapons of mass destruction.", "He and Dick Cheney were asserting that there was legitimacy to these claims. There wasn't. And so that on the most consequential act of her being a senator, she really, as Bernie Sanders had said, did the wrong thing. And she has said it was a mistake. At the same time, she did not sponsor any significant legislation in her time in the Senate. But what she was, was a great, terrific senator for bringing back the bacon to her state, especially after 9/11.", "New York City and New York State desperately needed aid. And she was great in getting it. And it's one of the reasons she was reelected overwhelmingly. She was effective for her state. She had the credibility with some of those former enemies, as well as with Democrats that were from other regions of the country, who otherwise would've looked askance at favored treatment for New York. But she convinced them that New York needed it in the wake of the attacks at 9/11. It's certainly the best thing that she did as a senator. She shouldn't be shortchanged on what she accomplished there.", "But meanwhile she was contemplating running for President of the United States, as I lay out.", "She became a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, partly to learn, and partly to bolster her qualifications for the presidency and to overcome the perception of weakness that she faced as a woman. Her vote to go to war in Iraq was calculated partly in terms of her knowing that if she voted against supporting George Bush in going to war in Iraq, it might make her path to the presidency much more difficult.", "Was it hard for Hillary Clinton to bury the hatchet and work for her rival as secretary of state?", "No. She saw it above all as an opportunity to do important work that she was qualified to do; and with the knowledge that, if she succeeded -- and almost inevitably by being the secretary of state stayed in the forefront of the national imagination -- she could well become the frontrunner to succeed Obama as the presidential candidate of her party.", "Perhaps the most difficult part in some way may have been the physical challenge: The U.S. secretary of state travels more than any leader on the world. She had just finished a presidential campaign -- and lost. She had gone from eight years in the White House, through the impeachment of her husband, straight into a campaign for the Senate, re-election in the Senate. Almost no downtime. Her stamina is incredible.", "What kind of secretary of state was Hillary Clinton, and how does the \"server question\" relate to that?", "She expected as secretary of state to be a real policymaker who would help shape President Obama's foreign and national security policies. It turns out she was shut out from real policy making and from having great influence on the president very, very early in his presidency. So what did she do? She became an ambassador, really, and probably as great an ambassador for the United States, a kind of ambassador-at-large to the world, as we've ever seen in the modern era. And the goodwill that she won around the world for both this country and for President Obama's policies, was extraordinary. Both with leaders of other countries, and with their people.", "You can make all kinds of charges, and there are some to be made about her conduct as secretary of state. And we've talked in this interview about the server, because it goes to who she is just as much as this question of being a great ambassador. Here are these two sides of her. And should equal weight be given to those two sides? Maybe at this point equal weight ought to be given because we've seen repetitively now her ability to get up after being knocked down, to put the bubble in the level in the middle; but also at the same time this question of truthfulness -- that has bedeviled her. The last paragraphs of \"A Woman In Charge\" begin, \"Since her Arkansas days, Hillary Rodham Clinton has had a difficult relationship with the truth.\"", "And those two aspects exist side-by-side. You don't get one without the other. I think we know that now. And one of the things in this election that's so interesting to watch is the enormous distrust factor, which is partly the product of this \"difficult relationship with the truth.\" Her lies, especially. And I don't think there's any other way to talk about some of the things that she has said, particularly in regard to the email server. Despite the fact that Donald Trump's lying, by comparison, is incessant, and however unbalanced he may be.", "Let's be frank about it. There are fact-based reasons for the \"distrust factor,\" in quotes, about Hillary Clinton, why she has such negative numbers. You can talk about her enemies and the damage they have done to her, but there are so many of these self-inflicted wounds that come from an unwillingness to be truthful at various important times. The vast right wing conspiracy did not tell her to put a server in her basement or dispatch Monica Lewinsky to the Oval Office.", "We can now see that -- consistently through her life on the public stage. As I write at the end of the book, \"[J]udged against the facts ... it underlines how often she has chosen to obfuscate, omit and avoid.\" This goes to her, not just to enemies. And it may be the question that ultimately will be the answer to whether she will be the president of the United States. Because she is up not just against Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders. She is up against herself right now and these traits -- that have come more and more to the fore to define her for too many people for political comfort.", "And maybe -- and I've talked to many prominent Democrats and a lot of people who have adored Hillary Clinton and been in her circle for years who now think that the worst thing she has done is to perhaps make it possible for Donald Trump -- the first neofascist demagogue in our history likely to be nominated by a major party -- to become President of the United States,  through her recklessness.", "Why can she not put this issue of the email server behind her?", " ", "(This interview was conducted before FBI Director James Comey announced his decision last week not to recommend charges.)", "There's a thread from Hillary's work on the Nixon impeachment, to Whitewater, to the server. About secrecy and not disclosing the truth, especially. Even keeping secret her failing the bar exam. Refusing to release her Wellesley senior thesis. Fiercely resisting disclosure of the transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches. I've given a lot of thought to this in the last few months. And I think you do have to connect some dots. I've been asked many times in the last year since the server first came to light, \"Was there anything Nixonian about this and about Hillary?\" To which I always have said, \"No, the parallel does not hold.\"", "But -- and I want to be very careful in what I say -- I've changed my mind about certain aspects of that, though Hillary is not Richard Nixon or anything approaching him. There are some Nixonian tendencies, however. I think now that we've seen in Hillary, particularly in the server controversy. Not just the lies. Some real paranoia, blaming enemies for problems of her own making, and real indications that she and Bill Clinton don't believe they are bound by rules that ought to be expected of them; that because others, especially Republicans, have flouted rules and political norms, that the Clintons are entitled to do it too. All in the larger scheme of \"doing good,\" which they  see themselves as totally committed to.", "But I do not believe that Hillary Clinton is a criminal in the Nixonian sense, or anything close to it; or Bill Clinton, though their ethical blindness to the conflicts of interest involving the Clinton Foundation and her being secretary of state are indefensible. And the money-grubbing. Yes, in some regards there are similarities between the Clinton Foundation and presidential libraries of the Bushes, and family dynasties and foreign donations. No excuse. It was said of Nixon, wrongly, that the cover-up was worse than the crime. Not true in Nixon's case, because Nixon was a criminal President from the beginning of his presidency until he resigned. The Watergate cover-up was inevitable -- because of the enormity of his crimes as president -- and thus the cover-up was almost the least of his crimes. And we know this from the tapes, not just from the reporting on Watergate, or from the Watergate committee or the impeachment investigation. It was a criminal presidency throughout. ", "But in the case of Hillary the, quote, \"cover-up\" about the server and the unwillingness to be truthful about it and its origins and real purpose, has caused her terrible difficulty. Look, this server was set up to evade accountability, so that her emails could not be subject to the Freedom of Information Act, and would be hidden from the press, and from members of Congress who might want to subpoena them. And I know this as a reporter from talking to people. It's indefensible.", "You said at the start of this interview that Hillary Clinton is the most famous woman in the world. She is a former first lady, senator and secretary of state. Her life is the proverbial open book. But do we know the real Hillary Clinton?", "That's the real question. Who is the real Hillary Clinton? That's why I wrote the book. That's what I attempted to answer through reporting, so that people could reach their own conclusions. And I don't state one. But what I do in the last three pages that turns out to be -- others who have read the book say -- prescient is I throw out there the idea that unless she can deal with her record about trustworthiness and honesty, then that part of the equation is going to increasingly define her and perhaps cost her the election.", "And the election I was talking about in the book was 2008. But now it turns out those pages are resonating in a way that I could not imagine when I wrote them. So, who at this date is Hillary Clinton? She is the sum of all of the parts in this book and in this picture of her. But in the years since the book was first published and while she was in the Senate and then the secretary of state, there has been a shifting in the weight of which aspects of the real Hillary Clinton are prevailing and have prevailed. Certainly in terms of how she is judged.", "Toward the end of the book, one of Hillary's oldest friends and political associates, a wonderful woman named Sara Ehrman says (as Hillary embarked on her first Senate campaign), \"I would say right now most everybody in her life is simply a means of getting where she has to go. ... I'm not saying she's an unethical person, because she's definitely not. But everything and everybody is part of the package of getting them there, getting them -- her and the president -- there for the greater good.\" By then Sara worried that Hillary's Christian, progressive optimism was in danger of devolving into arrogance -- \" 'God is on my side,' can be arrogance,\" Sara said. \"Hillary still believes she's going to shape the world.\"", "What has amazed me in these past months since she announced for the presidency is how many of Hillary's old friends -- who still support her -- say they are no longer sure, as they once were, who the real Hillary Clinton is. They express the same concerns as Sara Ehrman.", "Knowing Hillary Clinton as well as you do, what do you think she needs to do to convince America she should be the next President of the United States?", "First, continue with her message that Donald Trump is unfit to be president of the United States for all the reasons she -- and not a few Republicans -- have said. In fact, he is not fit, and, by comparison, she manifestly is, which she ought to be able to demonstrate on the basis of her life and record and the issues she has championed, whatever her shortcomings.", "Second, show and summon some real contrition about what has happened with the server and the underlying patterns that have led so many Americans to distrust her. Redemption: I suppose that's what she must come up with -- again. But this time for herself and not for her husband's presidency. There are plenty of attributes there. She's battle-tested, and that's admirable and helpful in this election. She's almost uniquely knowledgeable about the presidency. She understands America's national security needs. She actually has a history from her Senate years of learning how to work with Republicans. And thanks to Bernie Sanders, whose candidacy in part pushed her into it, she now has a vision of domestic political solutions that recognize the justifiable anger and dismay of so many struggling Americans who have been ignored by the \"elites\" and government policies and left behind in the \"new economy.\" The dismaying aspect for many of her old friends and supporters is that it took her so long to get there.", "It's probably her good fortune -- or the nation's misfortune if he wins -- that Donald Trump is her opponent, because given the downward trajectory of her campaign since she announced her candidacy, my guess is that her ship might have sunk by now if she had a different Republican opponent. She's got a lot of heavy lifting to do if she is going to win this thing.", "I say in the last paragraph in the book, and it probably still holds in 2016: \"But the jury remains out. She still has time to prove her case to effectuate those things that make her special, not fear them or camouflage them. We would all be the better for it because what lies within may have the potential to change the world, if only a little.\"", "Yeah, redemption.", " "]},

Jungians say advances in quantum physics and chaos theory also reinforced the principles of synchronicity.

It's self-generated -- it's produced by people looking for answers to personal problems, says Williams, author of \"Demystifying Meaningful Coincidences.\"", "Williams says synchronicities are neither random events nor coded messages from a transcendent divinity. Striking coincidences often occur when people are experiencing a psychological gridlock in their life.", "A person who swears off drinking, for example, may turn on the television set the same day of their resolution and see a movie about Alcoholics Anonymous. When one resolves to solve a personal problem, one will often see a \"resonant message\" embedded in a moment, he says.", "\"You're looking for patterns. It's like you're on your own psychological scavenger hunt. You look for pieces to fit the puzzle.

Kennedy.", "Both presidents had seven letters in their last names and were elected to office 100 years apart -- 1860 and 1960. Both were assassinated on a Friday in the presence of their wives, Lincoln in Ford's Theatre and Kennedy in an automobile made by Ford. Both were felled by assassins who went by three names, John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald. And both were succeeded by vice presidents who were Southern Democrats with the last name Johnson.", "What does it mean?", "Absolutely nothing, wrote Bruce Martin in an essay for Skeptical Inquirer magazine. Mathematical probability ensures that some coincidences will occur, but people assign less probability to coincidences than they deserve. Probability ensures that in a random selection of 23 people, he says, there is a 50% chance that at least two of those people celebrate the same birth date.", "Synchronicity supporters also ignore facts that challenge the meaning of their coincidences, he says. Take Lincoln and Kennedy: They shared similarities, but they were also born and died in different months, states and at different ages. What about those differences?", "\"For any two people with reasonably eventful lives it is possible to find coincidences between them,\" Martin wrote in the essay \"Coincidences: Remarkable or Random?\"", "\"Two people meeting at a party often find some striking coincidence between them, but what it is -- birthdate, hometown, etc. -- is not predicted in advance.\"", "Hollis, the Jungian analyst, readily concedes some coincidences exist apart from synchronicity. But he says there are other odd coincidences that go beyond mathematical possibility. You just can't explain them away. He says these strange stories reveal \"the spectral presence\" of some kind of energy that deliberately infiltrates people's daily lives.", "Consider one of the strangest synchronicity stories ever told:", "In 1938, Joseph Figlock, a street sweeper, was cleaning an alley in Detroit when a baby fell from an open, fourth-floor window. The baby hit Figlock in the head, the impact saving the child's life. A year later, Figlock was sweeping another alley when another baby fell from a fourth-floor window -- onto Figlock. Same fate. Both Figlock and the baby were unharmed.", "What does one make of such a story?", "Time magazine matter-of-factly reported Figlock's story under the headline, \"Coincidence in Detroit.\" It did not include any interviews -- and the story is one the Internet loves to debate as truth or fiction. This much appears to be sure: No one ever caught up with Figlock or either of the babies to see how their lives were shaped by those amazing moments.", "Try to explain why these coincidences occur, and few agree.

Ted Cruz.", "Excitement over O'Rourke's candidacy has been bubbling just below the surface for Democrats in Texas and Washington for a few months now, with optimism built, largely, on O'Rourke's fundraising ability and ", "President Donald Trump's surprisingly unimpressive poll numbers in the Lone Star State", ".", "Still, that optimism has been guarded -- largely because Democrats have been promising since at least 2002 that ", "this", " is the election where the changing face of Texas -- less white, more Hispanic -- gives them a real chance to win a statewide election.", "That optimism may be less guarded in the wake of this massive fundraising haul by O'Rourke.  But, raising oodles of money doesn't guarantee an O'Rourke win. (If money = victory, then Tony Sanchez would have been governor and Ron Kirk would be in the Senate.", " They aren't", ".)", "While O'Rourke's cash haul doesn't prove he's a sure-fire winner, it does reveal a few things about the race. Here are five.", "1. Democratic donors hate Cruz", ": Sure, O'Rourke is young, personable and handsome.  And, yes, Texas is a big state with", " lots and lots of donor money in it", ". But, a good chunk of O'Rourke's cash is the result of donors -- inside and outside of Texas -- who simply want to make Cruz sweat. Other than the current occupant of the White House, there's no Republican who Democrats hate more than Cruz -- largely as a result of his near-miss 2016 presidential campaign. That Cruz hatred among Democratic givers doesn't take away anything from O'Rourke; he saw the opportunity to run and capitalize on that dislike before anyone else did.", "2. O'Rourke has a much higher $$$ ceiling", ": The $6.7 million O'Rourke raised between January 1 and March 31 came from 141,000 donations. Some simple back of the envelope math means that the average contribution was around $50. (Obviously that's a broad estimate, not a hard-and-fast number.)  What it means is that O'Rourke should be able to go back to lots and lots of his donors and ask for more. (The contribution limit for an individual is $2,700 for the primary and another $2,700 for the general election.) The more he looks like he can be truly competitive, the easier that ask becomes.", "3. PAC money is overrated", ": When O'Rourke announced his candidacy, he pledged not to accept any donations from political action committees -- a move aimed at proving he wasn't part of the DC swamp. Most independent observers crushed him for that decision, insisting that the residual benefits he would get from being able to cast himself as un-owned by the permanent political class would be overshadowed by how much money he would be sacrificing. (Cruz has raised north of $580,000 from PACs.)  Turns out that O'Rourke hasn't needed PAC cash at all.", "4. O'Rourke isn't a creation of the national Democratic Party: ", "Per point No. 1, there's a tendency to assume that for any Democrat to raise the amount of money O'Rourke has that it must be coming from wealthy liberals on the two coasts who have cash to burn and just want to make Cruz's life difficult. Not so, at least as of February 18, the last day for which we have detailed information on O'Rourke's cash flow. (O'Rourke announced his fundraising through March 31 via press release but the actual report, which gives us a more detailed sense of where the money came from -- and how much of it he has left -- has yet to show up at the Federal Election Commission.)  As of that date, 49.99% of O'Rourke's donations came from inside of Texas with the remainder from outside the state. That's a healthy split that suggests O'Rourke is not simply a creation of national Democrats but has actual, on-the-ground support among Texans.", "5. This is a real race", ": Make no mistake: Cruz is still the favorite here. Texas remains a Republican state and despite what is expected to be a very good year for Democrats nationally, any credible GOPer starts with an edge over a Democrat in this state. That said, O'Rourke's fundraising will allow him to build a real voter identification and turnout effort statewide as well as battle Cruz on the TV airwaves. That doesn't guarantee victory. But it almost always ensures competitiveness."]},

On Friday, the eggs were already emblazoned with \"Presidential Primary NH 2020.\"", "Flake argued that Trump's rhetoric and style will eventually wear on the electorate and a return for civility will be in demand.

You can drill down hard on the base, you can have a great rally and have a lot of people excited, but that doesn't translate into electoral success these days,\" he said. \"You can only drill down so hard on the base.\"", "In his speech, which resembled remarks he gave at the National Press Club on Thursday in Washington, ", "Flake described Trump as a \"chaotic\" President ", "who has \"no strategic brilliance\" and has damaged the country's institutions. \"It's well past time for us to put country before party. We've tried the other way for too long. We've done our worst, now it's time to do our best.\" ", "Flake's anti-Trump crusade this past year has marked a stunning rebuke of a president from a senator of the same party, and while some Republicans have criticized the President, none have matched the degree to which Flake has scorched Trump. His biggest complaints involve the President's attacks on the media, his track record of telling falsehoods and what Flake describes as \"dysfunctional\" leadership from the White House.  ", "Trump has returned the fire. He told a small group of Republicans he was prepared to spend $10 million on defeating Flake in the primary, and he publicly offered support on Twitter for one of the senator's GOP challengers last year when it appeared Flake would run for re-election. He's also referred to the senator and former US congressman as \"Flake(y)\" and \"unelectable\" on Twitter.", "While the Democratic bench is filling up with, by some estimates, close to two dozen potential candidates, the list of possible Republican challengers is much shorter, with Flake, Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas most frequently mentioned, among others, by pundits.", "Of the group, Flake has been the most directly outspoken against the President. He delivered a major speech on the Senate floor targeting Trump and wrote an entire book blasting his own party for enabling Trump's success.", "\"Never has a party abandoned, fled its principles and deeply held beliefs so quickly as my party did in the face of the nativist juggernaut,\" he said Thursday at the National Press Club. \"We have become strangers to ourselves. Even as we pretend everything is fine.\"", "The last major primary challenge against a sitting president was in 1992, when former Nixon adviser Pat Buchanan unsuccessfully ran against George H.W.

", "Flake acknowledged that a primary bid will be a difficult fight due to the President's heavy support among the base.
