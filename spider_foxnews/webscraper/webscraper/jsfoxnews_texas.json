Ted Cruz.", "ADVERTISEMENT", "Beto O'Rourke, a 44-year-old Democrat from the remote West Texas city of El Paso, has advocated for legalizing marijuana and preaches tolerance on the U.S.-Mexico border in defiance of President Donald Trump's \"Build that wall\" mantra.", "On Friday, O'Rourke should formally announce his 2018 Senate candidacy against Cruz, a conservative who finished second to Trump in last year's GOP presidential primary.", "The third-term congressman and fluent Spanish speaker is the kind of rising political star Democrats hope can help begin turning deep red Texas blue, aided by a booming Hispanic population and state politics pushed even farther right by Trump and Cruz. He first made a name for himself playing guitar for Foss, an El Paso punk rock band that included drummer Cedric Bixler-Zavala, who went on to play for the Grammy Award-winning act The Mars Volta.", "But before O'Rourke can challenge Cruz, he'll have to emerge from a Democratic primary field that could include another up-and-comer, fellow Rep. Joaquin Castro from San Antonio.", "\"The Trump factor. He's the gift that keeps on giving to Democrats in Texas,\" said the state's Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa. \"It's energizing the base and changing the whole dynamics of electoral politics here, and that's what these two guys see.\"", "It's hard to imagine any Democrat taking Texas by storm, much less toppling Cruz, who added to his national stature running for president while remaining popular in most GOP circles back home. A Democrat hasn't won statewide office in Texas in 23 years, the nation's longest losing streak by a political party.", "Still, O'Rourke insists Cruz is beatable and there are some positive signs for Democrats, who in November swept down-ballot races in Harris County, which includes Houston, and made notable gains in other fast-growing areas. Trump still beat Hillary Clinton in Texas by 9 percentage points -- but that was the first time a Republican didn't carry the state by double digits since 1996.", "Castro hasn't tamped down speculation he too will run for Senate and would be favored over O'Rourke. Both have crisscrossed the state, engaging top donors and party activists. Hinojosa says he's assuming Castro will run with help from his twin brother, Julian, the former San Antonio mayor who was President Barack Obama's Housing and Urban Development Secretary.", "On resume alone, O'Roruke would seem an unlikely choice, but he has been an underdog before.", "O'Rourke was elected to the El Paso City Council at age 32 but remained virtually unknown outside his hometown until the 2012 Democratic primary, when he ousted eight-term Rep. Silvestre Reyes, a former House Intelligence chairman.", "His El Paso district is strongly Democratic, making general elections since then an afterthought. The dynamics will be far different in a Senate race: Even if O'Rourke survives a dogfight primary, beating Cruz would be far tougher.", "\"I think his history indicates if he decides to do this, he will spend all his energy, time and resources on getting elected,\" said Jose Rodriguez, a state senator from El Paso who has hosted past O'Rourke congressional fundraisers. \"There are indicators that people are tired of what's going on with the current administration (and) the kind of campaign that Ted Cruz ran.\"", "O'Rourke has long been a supporter of legalizing pot to slow the drug war that for years turned Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, into one of the world's deadliest places. He authored the 2011 book, \"Dealing Death and Drugs,\" which argued that America's war on drugs had failed.", "O'Rourke was arrested in 1995 for breaking and entering after jumping a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso during what he now says was a prank, but prosecutors declined the case. Three years later, O'Rourke was arrested for drunken driving and received deferred adjudication to avoid conviction, an incident he has called a mistake.", "His father was a former El Paso County judge and a longtime Democrat who switched parties in 1996 to run unsuccessfully for Congress as a Republican. The younger O'Rourke is an outspoken advocate for bipartisanship, saying both parties should work together to foment trade and cultural exchange on the border.", "When a snowstorm canceled flights into Washington this month, O'Rourke and Republican Rep. Will Hurd, from a sprawling Texas district next to his, spent 36 hours driving a rented Chevy Impala from San Antonio to the nation's capital, livestreaming much of the way. The pair became an internet sensation during hours of listening to Johnny Cash, hitting Whataburger and jointly opposing Trump's border wall.", "There was widespread speculation Cruz could face a GOP primary challenge for being slow to endorse Trump last fall -- but much of that has faded since Cruz has become a vocal supporter of Trump after November. Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier declined to comment on O'Rourke's entering the 2018 Senate race.", "Perhaps tellingly, Cruz has sometimes singled out the Castro brothers for past criticism. He hasn't targeted O'Rourke, at least not yet."]},

President Trump is telling Congress, Do your job, get to work on passing historic, Reaganesque tax reform that the American people voted for and they will benefit from.", "Now, tonight on this program, we will offer up solutions and we will explain why this is needed now more than ever. And more importantly, we will continue to hold Washington accountable. And that is tonight's important \"Opening Monologue.\"", "All right, President Trump is pushing for sweeping tax cuts and major tax reform. Why? To unleash the American economy and provide relief to the American people. Why? Because millions of Americans desperately need the health and the growth of the economy. ", "Now, the president sat down with a group of bipartisan lawmakers at the White House earlier today, and here's what he said.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)", "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have four principles for tax reform. Make the tax code simple and fair. Cut taxes substantially. It'll be the largest tax decrease in the history of our country for the middle class. Encourage companies to hire and grow in America, and by doing that, we're going to have to reduce the taxes for companies.", "TRUMP: Another bipartisan project that is urgently needed is infrastructure and infrastructure investment. ", "TRUMP: It's time now to build new roads, new bridges, airports, tunnels, highways and railways all across our great land. ", "TRUMP: We don't want to forget DACA. And it's already been a week-and-a-half and people don't talk about it as much. We want to see if we can do something with regard to immigration, with regard to the 800,000 people that are now -- young people. They're not children anymore. They were children. Now they're young people. But we want to see if we can do something in a bipartisan fashion. ", "TRUMP: We want to get our country working again and competing again worldwide. And there'll be nothing that can stop us.", "(END VIDEO CLIPS)", "HANNITY: Now, notice, but for DACA, the president was echoing everything he promised you in the campaign. Now, the president also wrote on Twitter earlier today, \"The approval process for the biggest tax cut and tax reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast, Congress.\" And he added, \"With Irma and Harvey devastation, tax cuts and tax reform is needed more than ever before. Go, Congress, go.\"", "Now, President Trump is right. The time for tax reform is right now. We did not do this since 1986! And tonight, the president dined with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. ", "Here's what's happening. Look, the president is reaching across the aisle to try and get things done because, let's face it, Republican leadership in Congress -- they have failed miserably and at every turn.", "Now, Republican failure -- they've broken promises. They have now left the president with no other option if he's going to keep his promises to the American people. They have proven themselves to be incompetent, ineffective. And the president -- frankly, I don't blame him -- he's done waiting and he's forging ahead with or without Mitch McConnell. We'll have more on him in just a second.", "But first, let's look at some of these statistics on how massive and how burdensome this tax system in this country has now become. Now, according to Republican members on the House Ways and Means Committee, the current federal tax code -- look at this, over 70,000 pages! Who could ever comprehend that?", "Now, put that in perspective for you -- back in 1913, when the income tax was introduced, it was only 400 pages long. Now, the Tax Foundation also has an estimate that Americans spent 8.9 billion hours in tax preparation last year! And that translates to over $400 billion in lost productivity.", "Now, the president understands this all has to change, because unlike the vast majority of politicians in the swamp and the sewer and the so-called policy wonks in D.C., well, the president -- he's actually run a business. And here's what the president has been calling for. Pay close attention.", "He wants bold tax cuts and tax reforms. He wants an emphasis on benefiting the middle class, including middle class tax cuts. He wants seven brackets to go to three brackets to make it easy and simple. He wants that 15 percent corporate tax rate. Why? Because that makes American businesses more competitive on the global stage. ", "And of course, he's been talking about allowing multi-national corporations -- what? To repatriate trillions of dollars that they have sitting overseas at a low rate. And that way, they can invest in American workers and build factories and manufacturing centers right here in Michigan, in Wisconsin and Ohio and Pennsylvania.", "And of course, he's also pushing energy independence. Why? Because there are literally millions of high-paying career jobs available. And the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin -- he's saying the administration wants to make these tax cuts retroactive. Wow! People start spending money.", "Texas Senator Ted Cruz -- who will join us in just a minute -- he's also offering up his own tax reform plan. Now, here's the senator explaining today what you, the American people, need and why you need tax reform. Take a look.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)", "SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: Our economy since World War II has grown on average 3.3 percent a year. And yet for the past eight years, we've been mired in stagnation. ", "CRUZ: From 2008 to 2012, the economy grew on average 0.9 percent a year.", "CRUZ: Ronald Reagan was elected on a promise of tax cuts, of tax reforms. We saw historic tax reform in '81 and '86. And by the fourth year of Reagan's presidency, 1984, we went from stagnant economic growth, less than one percent a year, to 7.2 percent a year -- massive, booming growth lifting millions out of poverty, increasing significantly median incomes!", "(END VIDEO CLIPS)", "HANNITY: Senator Cruz is right. In the Reagan years, Reagan went from 70 to 28 percent top marginal tax rates in this country. OK, how did it result? Government doubled the revenues that they had in eight years, 20 million new jobs were created. ", "And by the way, Here are the highlights of what Senator Cruz is proposing. This makes perfect sense, and it's simple and it's easy and it's basic and it's fundamental. A low flat tax rate, tax returns that can be filed on a postcard, immediate expensing for businesses, a low corporate tax rate, repatriation, ending the death tax, getting rid of the alternative minimum tax. ", "Now, President Trump and Senator Cruz's philosophy on tax reform is simple. They want to get the government off your back and let you keep more of your hard-earned money in your wallet, spend it the way you want.", "And as we've been seeing, President Trump is working nonstop. He wants to get his major agenda items passed with members of Congress, meeting with them day and night and by taking his message on the road and speaking directly to the American people. ", "Now it's time for Congress. I cannot believe they have no urgency. Get your job done! And I'm specifically talking about, you, Senator Mitch McConnell and the never-Trumpers out there like, let's see, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake -- oh, Ben Sasse. We'll add him to the list.", "You know what? It's now or never. And by the way, no more excuses as to why you can't keep your promises. Oh, it's so hard! Well, for seven-and- a-half years, you promised to repeal, replace ObamaCare, and you couldn't get it done. ", "No more blaming the president like Mitch McConnell did last month, and he said the president had excessive expectations, and well, he doesn't understand the parliamentary procedures and the difficulties of legislation because he's never done this before. Take a look.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, AUG. 7)", "SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., MAJORITY LEADER: Now, our new president has, of course, not been in this line of work before and I think had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.", "(END VIDEO CLIP)", "HANNITY: That's so pathetic! That's the swamp! That's the sewer! And now, according to Roll Call, Senator McConnell is now saying tax reform may have to wait until next year? This is pathetic! It's inexcusable! It's unacceptable! Why did we elect you? ", "Now, it's time for an ultimatum. Senator McConnell, other Republicans, if you don't get the urgency to work for the American people, if you don't pass tax reform by the end of this year, you need to resign, go home, play golf, and get out of the way and let's get people in those positions that can serve the American people. ", "I'm tired of the complacency and business as usual. You know what? It's not been working. Congress is now failing the American people -- 50 million Americans in poverty, 50 million on food stamps, 90-plus million out of the labor force, lowest home ownership rate in 51 years. Really? ", "This is why, Congress, you have an approval rating that hovers around 15 wonderful percent. It's why Mitch McConnell has a dismal 18 percent approval rating in his own home state of Kentucky!", "Now, instead of whining and complaining and pointing fingers about why you can't pass legislation, you people in Washington and Congress, time to roll up your sleeves, get in a room -- I'll send you pizza and beer -- and turn off the air conditioner, like our framers and founders, and get to work and don't leave the room until you build consensus to help people.", "You know what? It's not like these issues or ideas are new. Just like with ObamaCare. What have you been doing? You've been promising and promising and running and elect us and elect us. The American people -- you've been doing this for years! And you know what? You said you're going to do this. You said you'll cut taxes. You said you'll pass reform. You said you'll repeal and replace. Where is your sense of urgency? Every American I know has a sense of urgency on their job. Where's your accountability?", "Now, the president can't do everything on his own. You need to hold up your end of the bargain. You need to accomplish something for once!", "Here with reaction, Texas senator Ted Cruz. Senator, are my expectations out of whack?", "SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: Sean, you're exactly right. Your expectations are what the American people are rightly demanding. We need to get the job done. We've got a mandate, an overwhelming victory from the voters in November. They've given us a Republican president, Republican heads of every agency and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. We don't have any more excuses. We need to get the job done.", "And the big four that we promised the American people is repeal the train wreck that is \"Obama care.\" We've got to get that done. Major tax cuts, major tax reform -- we got to get that done. Regulatory reform, getting Washington off the backs of small businesses and job creators. And confirming constitutionalists to the U.S. Supreme Court and the federal courts.", "If we do those four, this could be the most productive Congress in decades. And if we don't do any of them, it will be a heartbreaking missed opportunity.", "HANNITY: Listen, I see that your plan and the president's plan are almost identical. I can live with either one and the American people would benefit. You add energy independence to that. ", "CRUZ: Absolutely.", "HANNITY: You're right about justices. You build 400 miles -- 300 miles of the wall. You show you're getting that job done. And Republicans can have the best year they ever dreamed of in 2018!", "CRUZ: Yes.", "HANNITY: But it's not happening. And I -- do you agree that the Republicans, especially in the Senate, have pushed the president into the arms of the Democrats now, and he's got to look for alternates?", "CRUZ: Well, look, I think the president is frustrated. I think the American people are frustrated because we're not getting the job done. On \"Obama care,\" we came one vote short. It was beyond -- it made your head explode. But let me tell you, on \"Obama care,\" we're going to get the job done. I believe failure is not an option. I've told Mitch McConnell, I've told other senators we need to keep at it until we honor that promise, and critically, we lower premiums and give people more choices, more options, put you in charge of your health care.", "On tax reform, we've got to do it. And what the president just said that you aired earlier on the show, simple and fair. Put it on a postcard. Get rid of those 9 billion hours that we waste filling out forms, paying accountants, paying lawyers. Make it simple, fair and focus on jobs. ", "HANNITY: All right...", "CRUZ: Let small businesses create more jobs, raise wages. If we get the economy booming, we cut taxes, repeal \"Obama care,\" we'll have a terrific election in 2018. If we don't get any of it done, we'll have a terrible election in 2018!", "HANNITY: Senator, here's your plan. Now, it's what I've been saying. It's what the president has been saying. It's simple! Give the middle class a tax cut, corporate tax cuts, repatriation, file on a postcard. I agree with you 100 percent. And you add that to energy jobs and you've got millions of Americans now working. And you got money flowing in to Washington. You guys will have more money than you ever dreamed of. And Newt Gingrich told me he thinks it's about a 50 percent shot we get that done. Those aren't great odds to me.", "CRUZ: Well, and let me emphasize a couple of points from the tax speech I gave today. Number one, the president said today he wants a big, big tax cut. There's some Republicans in Congress that are talking about making tax reform revenue-neutral. Revenue-neutral means they're not cutting taxes. They're just moving money around from one bucket to another. We don't need revenue-neutral. We need a big tax cut on you, on families who are struggling, on small businesses. We need a Reaganesque tax cut that unleashes incredible growth.", "And I laid out today how we do it. We do that under the budget rules by having a 30-year budget window, which means we can have a big tax cut that isn't revenue-neutral that lasts for 30 years and unleashes booming growth.", "Let me make a second point, which is something I called for today, which is total expensing, immediate expensing of capital expenditures. What that does, if you're a farmer, it lets you buy a new tractor. If you're a steel worker, it lets the company invest in a new steel factory. If you're a truck driver, it lets you buy a new truck.", "We care about jobs here in America, Main Street jobs, manufacturing jobs, union jobs, blue-collar jobs. Immediate expensing unleashes incredible growth. I think that's a very important part of tax cuts and tax reforms that we're pushing forward.", "HANNITY: Senator, you mentioned that you still think the window's open on health care. One of the proposals -- and as a conservative, I always kind of like the idea of sending stuff back to the states...", "CRUZ: Absolutely.", "HANNITY: Lindsey Graham has that proposal. I talked to Dave Brat and I talked to Mark Meadows. They support it, but they said the devil is in the details. ", "CRUZ: Sure.", "HANNITY: Something that could work, is that maybe the alternate, maybe you get it done by the 30th using reconciliation or considering reconciliation?", "CRUZ: I think Lindsey Graham's proposal could easily be part of the solution. I am a big, big believer in federalism, sending things to the states, empowering the states. You know, that's something -- if Lindsey's proposal brings a few moderates on board, great. And let different states have different approaches. Let a John Kasich in Ohio have one approach, and let a conservative like Greg Abbott in Texas have a different approach. That's why we've got 50 states.", "HANNITY: Absolutely.", "CRUZ: And...", "HANNITY: That's why I'll move to Texas.", "CRUZ: ... and I think we're close on ObamaCare. You know, I think we're -- ", "HANNITY: I'm -- Senator, I want to say one last thing. I don't -- I'm really -- like, I can't tell you the type of feedback I'm getting from my audience in radio and TV. They are livid! They're apoplectic. And I will say this. You -- on health care, you keep saying on the economy, Keep your promises. The Freedom Caucus is working day and night with you and together to keep their promises. If these guys don't wake up, you're the only few people I trust in Washington now. It's really despicable.", "CRUZ: Well, Sean, the role I'm trying to play is do everything I can to help and encourage the president to go in a positive direction, not a negative direction, and to bring Republicans together, talking to conservatives and moderates and leadership and the president and the administration saying, Everyone, look, if we do our job, just keep our word, the economy booms...", "HANNITY: That's it.", "CRUZ: ... we see more jobs. And that's a win-win for everyone!", "HANNITY: Why does it have to be so hard? ", "CRUZ: Yes.", "HANNITY: Senator, I do appreciate you keeping your promises. It means a lot to us. Thank you. ", "And when we come back, Dr. Sebastian Gorka calling out the D.C. sewer, swamp. He's next.", "Later, Hillary Clinton still blaming -- on the blame game book tour! You're going to see Lanny Davis try to defend that and much more straight ahead.", "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "HANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Former deputy assistant to the president Dr. Sebastian Gorka had an interesting message for D.C. Republicans in a recent LA Times interview. Now, just take a look at the title of the piece. Sebastian Gorka says the GOP did not win last November, Donald Trump did. He joins us now to explain what he meant. He's also the author of \"Defeating Jihad.\"", "Dr. Sebastian Gorka, certainly, I would argue the president, and even today, was on message with the promises he made. To me, the Republican Party has no identity right now. They're not fighting for anything that they promised. You agree?", "SEBASTIAN GORKA, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely. Look, the president won the election. The rank outsider, the man who was anti-establishment as far as the right is concerned and the left is concerned -- he won an agenda of make America great again, not make the Republican Party great again. ", "And the sad thing is, Sean -- and this is the wakeup call and this is why he met with Schumer and Pelosi last week -- the GOP doesn't understand. It isn't the Republican Party that won last November the 8th. It is a New York real estate billionaire who won. And there's a reason for that, because they haven't served the nation's interests for more than a decade.", "HANNITY: You know, look, let's be honest here. Pelosi and Schumer -- they hate him, too.", "GORKA: Right.", "HANNITY: And they're political opportunists. And come 2020, there will be nothing he did that they're going to like and they will support the Democrat. Knowing the president as well as I do, I suspect, knowing Donald Trump, that he's basically sending a loud message, Get your act together or I'm going to find another way. I still think there's time and hope, but probably, the time is getting short now.", "HANNITY: You're absolutely right. This is the man who closes the deal. And he sent a very clear message. The viewers need to understand -- I saw a lot of stuff on social media that the president has caved and he's giving in to the Democrats. The opposite is true. He will keep to his agenda. That's the message he sent me the day after I left the White House. He said, I'm staying on the agenda, and I'd like you to help me. And I said, I'm going to help you. ", "He's not going to give up. But if he has to work with somebody else to get things done, he's going to do that, Sean, because he is results-oriented. And he doesn't matter...", "HANNITY: You know -- ", "GORKA: He doesn't care -- it doesn't care whether he's got an R behind your name or a D behind your name. He wants to make America great again.", "HANNITY: Is this statement true, that Republican inaction and failure and lack of vision and lack of urgency has pushed Donald Trump into the arms of Democrats? Is that a true statement?", "GORKA: I think it misrepresents what he wishes to do. He hasn't -- he hasn't pushed -- this was his call. They didn't invite themselves to the Oval Office. The president of the United States invited them. And you know, they say -- some people said he was firing a shot across the bow of the GOP. Wrong. Donald J. Trump fired a torpedo into the hull of the GOP to say, Guys, wake up.", "HANNITY: Wake up.", "GORKA: I'm serious...", "HANNITY: Wake up.", "GORKA: ... about what I want to do.", "HANNITY: Oh, listen, I think his more important issue is serving the American people. He's got to fulfill his promises, whether they do or not. Dr. Gorka, great insight. Always good to see you, my friend. Thanks.", "GORKA: Thanks, Sean.", "HANNITY: When we come back, Hillary Clinton continues -- we're now up to 42 specific excuses, blaming everyone but herself for her election loss. You don't want to miss this. Lanny Davis, Caley McEneny (ph) will debate and face off. A \"Hannity\" shoot-out straight ahead.", "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "(NEWSBREAK)", "HANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" So Hillary Clinton continues to blame everyone and anything for her loss in 2016 in the election except, of course, herself.

Watch this.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)", "MATT LAUER, NBC NEWS: When it comes to the self-inflictd wounds, when you look at the list of them -- and you go through them in the book -- did you make enough mistakes yourself to lose the election without any of the other things you talk about?", "HILLARY CLINTON, D-FMR. PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, I will say no, Matt. I don't think that will surprise you.", "(END VIDEO CLIP)", "HANNITY: No, Matt, I didn't do anything! And there's more.

Why isn't she on the list? And by the way, why isn't Trump on the list, because he beat her soundly? ", "LANNY DAVIS, TRIDENT DMG FOUNDER: I have no idea why you just read that list. But first off, good evening, Sean, nice to be with you.", "HANNITY: Just for your entertainment purposes. ", "DAVIS: I was entertained. But let's take the occasion for a historic moment, and that is there's something that Hillary Clinton and President Trump agree on, which Clinton has said publicly now. And that is the poor, I would say reckless judgment of James Comey. And I don't know whether he deserved to the fired because of the Russian investigation. That sounds like a poor decision by the president which led to the Mueller appointment, but I do think he should have been disciplined because of his recklessness and the way he handled Hillary's email investigation, and President Trump and his deputy attorney general agree with that statement. So let's start out on what we agree with. ", "HANNITY: All right, Lanny, this is what I love about you. I didn't ask you any of those questions. ", "DAVIS: I made you speechless. It's a historic moment. ", "HANNITY: I didn't ask you that question in any way, shape, matter, or form. ", "DAVIS: You did not. ", "HANNITY: And the fact that Comey exonerated Clinton before he even did the investigation is pretty amazing. ", "All right, Kayleigh, maybe you'll answer my question because Lanny has no desire to answer it.", "(LAUGHTER)", "KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC SPOKESPERSON: I'm ready to answer it. Yes, Sean, it's incredible. She blames Comey. As you point out, he exonerated her months before he had even interviewed her. Instead of blaming Comey, she should be crediting him with her evasion of just, but instead she blames him. ", "And let's just debunk this myth right now, Lanny. The \"New York Times\" Nate Cohn, obviously no friend of Republicans here, said I even question this so-called Comey defense because his poll showed the day the Comey came out with that announcment that Trump was winning by four points in Florida. Trump was already on the upswing. I would advise Hillary Clinton to take a self-reflective moment and blame herself for the election loss rather than some faux reasoning for James Comey.", "DAVIS: Of all people that Hillary Clinton will not be taking advice from, Kayleigh, with all due respect, is you. ", "MCENANY: Well, she'd probably be in 1600 Pennsylvania if she did.", "DAVIS: We do agree, and, Sean, I believe you agree, that when the deputy attorney general criticized Comey for poor judgment, for violating the rules, and that he deserved to be disciplined, I can show you data that on the day that Comey wrote his letter Hillary Clinton was ahead in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan but six to eight percentage points, and within two days of that letter, she plunged.

Here's the most amazing thing, and I can't take it anymore, Danielle. I don't like that conservatives, that the president -- this is a lie. And this is a narrative that happens every two years and every four years. Republicans, conservatives, the president are racists, sexist, misogynistic.

I think we remember what happened to Curt Schilling because of a post that he made on Facebook. Again, it was not on the channel, but his repercussions were far more strict than the little talking to that they gave the other host over at ESPN.

Having said that, she has the right to say it. ", "But here's the thing, Sean. It's as if ESPN doesn't realize that the Trump voter is their audience. If you look at the NFL players, you look at the PGA, the LPGA even, very frequent voters, very conservative people, and those are your ESPN viewers. And so if they were going to do anything with this particular commentator, they may want to think of replacing her just because she is bashing their own audience. This is why the left continues to lose, and this is why conservatives tend to build their numbers.

Tomi, I assume, and I don't know for sure, I know I've been a target of all of this, and fire Hannity and boycott Hannity. And the left isn't really tolerant. I've seen horrible things about you and Dr. Loudon, myself on social media and by these groups that are funded seemingly from Soros type of people. ", "LAHREN: Of course. And I'm not someone that has gone to bat for what I believe in, I've had to feel the repercussions. So I'm not somebody that calls for boycott or calls for firings either, and I would never do that. I have been very vocal about that. ", "But I will say this, kind of what Dr. Gina was talking about there, the Trump voter is a sports watcher and we're folks that enjoy watching ESPN, love watching the commentary. And I wouldn't call for a boycott, I wouldn't call for a firing, but I would just say to ESPN, your numbers are not going to lie, because we're going to start turning off the TV. And that's how we're going to voice our opinion, that's how we're going to use our freedom of expression, our freedom of speech. So watch you. You might be losing a big chunk of your audience, and we're not going to feel bad for you when you do. ", "HANNITY: And, Danielle, last point to you. It hasn't been helping the NFL.

That's one of the foundational values of this country. And I don't like it when it comes from the left or the right.", "On Colin Kaepernick, he has the free-speech right to protest, to take a knee, which I personally think is a very reverential thing to do obviously when you listen to the National Anthem. People have the right to like it, to not like it. His employers, a private entity, have the right to hire him or not. And maybe this is the free market talking, but I will defend his right to take that knee until my last breath.

Why do I think that? Because his wife who is safely ensconced in Pakistan has now reportedly decided to turn herself in to American authorities. She wouldn't do that unless an immunity deal was in the works to implicate people like Debbie Wasserman Shultz.", "Now, did Russians actually hack our system? A senior investigative official said, does it mean that this guy sold the information to the Russians? I don't know. So, Sean, they're clearly looking at whether a Democratic insider is the one who gave the information to the Russians, not hacking at all.", "HANNITY: And add to that, Sara Carter, that Imran Awan actually took Debbie Wasserman Shultz's computer, left it in a place with a message for law enforcement, here, it's all here. I've got to believe Debbie Wasserman Shultz, I think that plea deal is coming. She's in trouble. ", "SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: Well, I have to believe something is coming because not only did Imran leave her laptop sitting there in that small room at the Rayburn office building, but he left a letter for the U.S. attorney. He left copies of his identification sitting all around. Luke was very detailed in this story on how this happened. ", "And just like Gregg said, Sean, these are huge national security implications. Imran Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, they moved data apparently, if this story is true, from protected servers of members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, to an offsite server that was connected to the House Democratic Caucus. And that could have been established right there. They could have put it within the server that's connected to the House Democratic Caucus, created a backdoor where they could infiltrate that system wherever they wanted. ", "And not only that, he created a Dropbox account where he put everything into this Dropbox account where he could access it after February 2nd when he was removed. And all of his trips to Pakistan for months at a time and having armored escort in Pakistan has to raise the suspicion that possibly Imran and his wife Hina Alvi are connected to Pakistani intelligence.

Anybody goes anywhere, refugees flooding in. Nobody knows who is coming and who is going.", ": Right.", " We don't have that here in the U.S.A. and we have some problems but not nearly to the extent that they have. Is that right?", " Well, you know, when it comes to open borders a few days ago I was down on the border in Arizona. And I will tell you it was a tiny little fence. My five-year-old daughter could have crossed that border in all of about 10 seconds. Actually, we had a bunch of reporters there. Several of the reporters jumped the fence into Mexico because they had a better shot from their cameras. And I was laughing we are literally watching them cross the border illegally and enter Mexico. And, you know, we have had 12 million people coming into this country illegally. We are not securing the border right now at a time with threats from ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism, it makes no sense to not know who is coming in this country.", " All right. So, you agree with me and with your competitor Trump that you need a wall, you need a formidable wall.", ": Absolutely yes.", ": All right. We're all on board --", ": But a wall alone doesn't do it.", ": No.", ": More important than that is boots on the ground. That's why we are going to triple the border patrol and used fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft to monitor the wall. The wall alone slows them down. But you've got to have the boots on the ground.", ": Yes. That's like the Israeli too, that's the model we should be using.", " Yes.", " Now, you made some other statements against ISIS today. And one of them caught my eye. You say you would carpet bomb them. You said that before.", " Um-huh.", " You know that carpet bombing means women and children dead in the street. You know that?", " It doesn't mean that. What I mean by carpet bombing is using overwhelming air power not doing --", " They hide in civilian areas.

We will come after you and we are not coming after to you negotiate, to compromise, to capture you, if you have declared jihadi in America, we are coming after to you kill you.", " Okay. Let's just recap this segment so everybody is clear. All right? You don't believe in carpet bombing cities where ISIS is for the civilian casualties. You are not going to do that.", ": You don't wantonly target civilians but at the same time, you don't use rules of engagement that make it impossible for our troops.", ": You step up the bombing. You would encourage NATO to declare war on ISIS.", " Absolutely.", " You have all of that power then.", " Yes.", ": Launched against these savages. You want increased law enforcement surveillance here in the United States on radical Muslim concerns, would that be fair?", " Absolutely.", " And you are for a very stringent border with more backup.", " Yes.", ": To keep the -- all right? Do I have it?", " And we shouldn't be allowing in tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees that ISIS has said they want to infiltrate and send jihadist --", ": Sure. That's what's happening in Europe. I mean, it's obvious that is happening there. All right. Now, we would hold you over to talk about the political thing.

Thanks for watching this special edition of The Factor, \"Election 2016.\"", "And our top story tonight, Ted Cruz on the attack. The Texas Senator went after Donald Trump on The Factor last night saying he is not much different from an establishment politicians like Hillary Clinton.", " It's actually not a question of being more conservative or not. If you are fed up with the corruption of Washington.", "Yes.", " Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are flip sides of the same coin. Hillary Clinton has made millions of dollars selling power and access in Washington and Donald Trump has made billions of dollars buying power and access in Washington, buying people like Hillary Clinton.", " He did it as a businessman.", " But he is part of the corruption. He is part of the corruption.", ": All right.", ": He has funded open border Democrats for 40 years. And the people of New York are hurting.", ": With us now in New York Andrea Tantaros, co-host of \"OUTNUMBERED\" and Democratic strategist Jessica Tarlov. Seems to me Cruz's strategy in New York is, I don't go to Clinton weddings and they're the insiders. They're the influence peddlers, they buy and sell politicians and I'm this big outsider. Do you think that's going to work for Ted Cruz in New York?", "I don't think it's going to work. And New Yorkers are upset at Ted Cruz for his New York values comment.", ": Right.", ": But also as much as he tries to paint himself as an outsider and I do agree, Ted Cruz for being in insider isn't really part of the establishment. He's not well liked. But he runs into trouble, Jesse, because he said before that he doesn't take money from lobbyists when he does. I mean, Cruz takes money like most politicians as well as their PACs from organizations like Goldman Sachs, the big banks, Credit Suisse. So, I think it's a bit of a problem. Also, Donald Trump took that vulnerability off the table for himself a long time ago by saying, I admit it, I'm part of the problem.", "That's right.", ": I'm a lobbyists, I use my influence. I use my money. Because that's what I have to do. I have to buy influence with Democrats and Republicans. But I will fix it when I get to Washington.", "Right.", " So, he took that attack off the table kind of hard to get him on that.", " He said, you know, no one plays the game better than I do.", " Exactly.", ": Now I'm going to work for you, the people.", ": He does have a point, Jessica, about Hillary Clinton, who has been at the center of pay-for-play her entire career selling the Lincoln bedroom. Clinton Foundation, I mean, that's what the Clintons do. That's how they roll, is that wrong?", " Yes, I do think that you are wrong.", ": Really?", ": I mean, the Lincoln bedroom thing for sure. But no, I think you are wrong and so far as and I know that we really have to get into the weeds here and pierce has written extensively about the, you know, Clinton world and Clinton cash and something that has said. You know, there is no evidence of a quid pro quo here. And I'm not at all going to say that there isn't a murkiness, there certainly is and I think this is one of the things that drives her problem with the honest and trustworthiness ratings and also for Donald Trump as well and I think that it doesn't benefit any Hillary supporter to say, you know, she is squeaky clean. She is not. But there is an evidence.", " Well, I mean, there is evidence, the \"New York Times\" reported that, you know --", ": Yes.", " -- Bill Clinton gets a half a million dollars from the Russians and then the State Department gives them all the uranium that they need.", "-- Explicitly. We cannot prove that this is why that happened. Peter Schweizer, we cannot prove this is why that happened.", ": That's where the quid pro quo is, is I scratch your back you scratch -- that's how it works.", ": No. There is no smoking gun on this. There just isn't.", ": But Jessica, Jessica --", ": Go ahead, Andrea.", ": Where there is smoke there is fire. And when it comes to the Clintons, I mean, you are coughing from all the smoke.", "I mean, No one can breathe anymore. I mean, you look at the quid pro quo and there is no such thing as the Clinton coincidence.", ": Right.", ": I mean, Jesse, you brought up, I should say the deal, the uranium plant that was sold to the Russians and then coincidently Bill Clinton gets a big speaking fee in Moscow for, you know, half a million dollars. And the list goes on and on. It's not just that deals, its deals in Oslo, its deals in Sweden, it's the Haiti business deals with the Clinton Foundation. All of this points to really shady sketchy activity. And when Clintons do corruption they go big.", ": Right.", ": They go really big.", ": Jessica -- Jessica, if it's -- if she is not being shady, then why isn't she releasing the transcripts, the speeches to Wall Street? If she is not being shady, why did she continue to solicit donations to the foundation while she was secretary of state when she said she wouldn't?", ": There wasn't soliciting of the foundation.", ": She was taking money from overseas countries while Secretary of State when she told Obama she wasn't.", " The foundation was taking money.", ": Yes. It's the same thing.", ": It's not the same thing.", ": It's not the Clinton Foundation?", " No, well I think that was the Bill Clinton Foundation. It was the Clinton Foundation the way that it was after she was secretary of state.", ": Same name.", " Everything your wife does you do, too?", ": I have to. Or else I get in trouble.", ": That's true.", ": But what about the server? I mean, we know that the server, her server that's in question was set up by the Clinton Foundation. I mean, there are so many connections between Bill and Hillary Clinton and the foundation and how she pedaled her influence as secretary of state. And that's the biggest difference. And you can't pin that on a Donald Trump or a Ted Cruz. I mean, she really has a problem, Jessica, when it comes to her position and using it.", ": There is a problem there, absolutely. And as I said earlier, I think that this is effecting obviously her support. But going back to the Donald Trump issue, you said yes, he got it out of the way and he said hey there, I bribe people. This is how it works in the business world. I hope you like it, I hope you vote for me.", ": And he didn't say I bribe people, he said I grease politicians. Every real estate developers greases politicians. How do you think you are going to get a golf course through?", ": Right.", ": That's how the world works, you know it. Hey, listen, he has distanced himself from pay to play. He says I don't do it anymore. I'm self-funding, Hillary Clinton hasn't returned any Donald Trump donations, has she?", " This is a joke, right?", ": Is Hillary returned any Donald Trump donations, yes or no?", ": I will call her right now.", ": Yes. Yes. Find out for me because I don't think she has.", " I don't think that that's the point here. Donald Trump is the number one opportunist in this race whether it's, you know, Trump steaks, Trump University, having convicted felons.", ": Hillary has been running for president for 30 years.", ": Isn't she great at it?", ": We don't know yet.", " The Clintons have been in office for so long, they have made so much money by being professional politicians. I mean, they have made all their money in the public sector on the backs of taxpayers and big donors, and I do think it points to a huge problem.", ": Are we agreeing that Donald Trump is a saint here because I'm a little bit confused to what's going on?", ": And the Clintons stole the White House China. All right? Let's not forget that.", ": And the W's off the keyboard.", ": That's right. Andrea and Jessica, thank you guys very much."]},
