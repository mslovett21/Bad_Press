Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia investigation.", "The assertion by Ms. Sanders was surprising because the general understanding has been that Mr. Trump himself cannot directly fire Mr. Mueller, and that he would instead have to order the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purpose of the Russia inquiry, to do so. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any involvement in the investigation.", "Mr. Rosenstein has repeatedly said that he will refuse any order to fire Mr. Mueller unless he decides the special counsel committed misconduct. If the general understanding is correct, then, Mr. Trump would probably have to fire Mr. Rosenstein and hunt for a successor willing to carry out the order \u2014 echoing the \u201c", "Saturday Night Massacre", "\u201d during the Watergate scandal.", "In 1973, President Richard M. Nixon decided to force the Justice Department ", "to fire Archibald Cox", ", the first special counsel investigating Watergate. Both the attorney general and the deputy attorney general resigned rather than carry out those orders before the solicitor general, then the No. 3 official in the department, finally agreed to do so. The episode was a milestone in the eventual decision by the House to begin impeachment proceedings.", "Ms. Sanders\u2019s initial remark on Tuesday was vague. But when pressed to clarify whether she meant only that Mr. Trump could direct Mr. Rosenstein to fire Mr. Mueller, she insisted instead that \u201ca number of individuals in the legal community and including at the Department of Justice\u201d have said that Mr. Trump himself has the power to oust him.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve been advised that the president certainly has the power to make that decision,\u201d she added.", "But there is scant precedent supporting the notion that Mr. Trump has lawful authority to bypass the acting attorney general and directly fire Mr. Mueller, legal scholars said.", "Martin S. Lederman, a Georgetown University law professor who served in the Office of Legal Counsel during the Obama administration, pointed to a series of Supreme Court cases in which justices across generations have said that the power to remove a government employee resides with the official \u2014 or a successor \u2014 who appointed the person, unless Congress has enacted a statute making an exception.", "Among them, ", "in a seminal 1839 case", ", the Supreme Court said the heads of departments appointed inferior officials and had the power to remove them, adding \u201cthe president has certainly no power to remove.\u201d As recently ", "as in a 2010 case", ", Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., observed that if Congress had vested in a department head the power to appoint an inferior officer, \u201cit is ordinarily the department head, rather than the president, who enjoys the power of removal.\u201d", "Against that backdrop, Mr. Lederman argued: \u201cSurely if Richard Nixon could have fired Archie Cox himself, he would have done so to avoid the Saturday Night Massacre. He didn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t have the authority to do so.\u201d", "Still, Jack L. Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and former head of the Office of Legal Counsel in the Bush administration, said the previous Supreme Court statements did not arise in a context exactly like a situation in which Mr. Trump said he had the constitutional power to fire Mr. Mueller directly and then tried to do it. Mr. Goldsmith said it was unclear what would happen then.", "\u201cI agree that the proper and most legally sound route would be to order Rosenstein to dismiss Mueller and then fire him if he doesn\u2019t comply,\u201d Mr. Goldsmith said. \u201cThat is clearly the right way under the law. That is the right way under the precedents. And that would be the legally safer way to do it. But there is an argument that he could do so directly and that question has never been tested in a context exactly like this.\u201d", "Further complicating matters is the question of how much the Justice Department\u2019s regulation for special counsels is protecting Mr. Mueller.", "People who do not want the Trump administration to fire Mr. Mueller have taken comfort from the fact that when Mr. Rosenstein ", "appointed Mr. Mueller", ", he stated that a portion of those regulations \u2014 including a provision that says only the attorney general can fire a special counsel and only for misconduct \u2014 would be \u201capplicable\u201d to Mr. Mueller.", "In a statement criticizing Ms. Sanders\u2019s statement on Tuesday, Matt House, a spokesman for the Senate minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, \u201cThe D.O.J. regulations could not be more clear.\u201d", "In ", "the 1974 case ", "over the Watergate tapes, the Supreme Court cited a similar regulation protecting Mr. Cox\u2019s successor, Leon Jaworski, from being fired without good reason and said that unless it was rescinded, \u201cthe executive branch is bound by it.\u201d", "Still, one novel question is whether a president must obey a Justice Department regulation.", "Another is whether the regulation is actually protecting Mr. Mueller from arbitrary firing by anyone other than Mr. Rosenstein, specialists said. The last question is raised by the fact that Mr. Rosenstein did not technically appoint Mr. Mueller under that regulation.", "Rather, he invoked ", "statutes", " in which Congress authorized the attorney general to appoint special lawyers for specific investigations, but those statutes include no special protections.", "That has left it murky whether Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s statement that the regulation applies to Mr. Mueller is legally binding or was more like a personal promise about the approach he would follow as Mr. Mueller\u2019s supervisor. Still, Mr. Lederman said the distinction might make little difference in practice, since any successor to Mr. Rosenstein who was determined to fire Mr. Mueller could also just rescind Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment letter or the regulation itself.", "\u201cYou\u2019re already way out there if you\u2019re willing to fire Mueller, so if you have to get rid of the regulation or the appointment letter to do so, that person, whoever that would be, would probably be happy to do so,\u201d he said."]},

And 2018 seems like an especially good time for an active, unapologetic heroine who is neither condescended to nor sexualized.", "Ms. Rashad, a graceful and electric performer, is the ninth actress to step into Joan\u2019s battle dress on Broadway. The director Daniel Sullivan cast her, in part, because \u201cJoan is angry for much of the play,\u201d he said, and he counted on Ms. Rashad\u2019s ease, enthusiasm and nobility to keep that anger from turning \u201crather strident.\u201d", "Would a strident Joan be so bad? We won\u2019t know this season. Because Ms. Rashad, 31, doesn\u2019t see Joan as strident.

She said it more than once.", "As for \u201cSaint Joan\u201d as a #MeToo play, she wanted it noted that for every man who burned Joan, there were many more who fought with her. \u201cWe can\u2019t just look at one side because it feels better,\u201d she said.", "I met Ms. Rashad \u2014 who has a straight-arrow supporting role in the Showtime series ", "\u201cBillions,\u201d", " plays a sympathetic preacher\u2019s wife in the new Netflix film ", "\u201cCome Sunday\u201d", " and leads the alternative band ", "Condola and the Stoop Kids", " \u2014 on a recent afternoon that felt more like winter than spring. Sartorially, she\u2019d split the difference: black coat, flowered pants, turquoise eyeliner.", "She had a break from rehearsal \u2014 it was a week before previews began, stagehands were loading in the set \u2014 and she\u2019d taken a car to a traffic triangle on the Upper West Side.

(Her cast mates in the Manhattan Theater Club production include Adam Chanler-Berat, Patrick Page and Jack Davenport.) She doesn\u2019t mind being one of the few people who are not white. \u201cOf course I want there to be more people of color in the room, but there\u2019s also the thing of \u2018Well, I\u2019m here. Let\u2019s make the most of it,\u2019 \u201d she said.", "When her casting was announced, a few French ultranationalist Twitter users and some bullying Reddit posters accused her of cultural appropriation. She read a few of the comments and then she stopped. The abuse didn\u2019t make her mad. Actually, she mostly felt sorry for the complainers, she said. \u201cYou guys are missing out.\u201d", "It is tempting to want to poke at Ms. Rashad\u2019s extraordinary poise, to wonder if it\u2019s innate or a necessary adaptation to a business and a culture that doesn\u2019t always applaud female truth-telling. Where does serenity stop and really solid media training begin?", "Well, a potential manager once told Ms. Rashad that she was too elegant to play prostitutes, which is an icky way of suggesting that she carries herself with a certain reserve. But she isn\u2019t cold, and she isn\u2019t snooty. I spoke to five directors who worked with her and they threw around nouns like maturity and intelligence and strength and dignity and humanity and authenticity and, in Mr. Sullivan\u2019s words, \u201ca wonderful simplicity.\u201d", "So I don\u2019t think the equanimity is an act. Or if it is, she has everyone fooled. Even her mother.

She told a childhood story of watching Condola standing in the driveway, waiting for a butterfly to alight on her fingers. The butterfly did.", "Still, the denial of Joan\u2019s anger nagged at me. Could Ms. Rashad be great in a great part if she refused to play the full range of it?", "Her Broadway roles have included a sweetie-pie Juliet in a ", "muddled Shakespeare,", " a grief-struck daughter in ", "\u201cStick Fly,\u201d", " a melancholy young bride in ", "\u201cThe Trip to Bountiful.\u201d", " She has a strong affinity for good characters (with typical humility she disputes this: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I\u2019m captain good guy\u201d), and she has the rare ability to make goodness fascinating. When characters act dishonorably, it throws her.", "This season, Kate Sacker, the assistant United States attorney she plays on \u201cBillions,\u201d makes some less-than-aboveboard moves, and she found the filming hard. I\u2019d watched her rehearse the first scene of \u201cSaint Joan,\u201d and her Joan had been determined, girlish, joyful. Would she be more?", "I worried about it all the way home, from the Upper West Side back to Brooklyn, and then I read the play again. Now I\u2019m pretty sure Ms. Rashad is right about the anger and the character and probably some other things. Joan is good at converting doubters to her cause. Ms. Rashad is, too.", "I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised.

(Here\u2019s her mother on that part: \u201cIt was the bomb! My God, girl, where did you get that all from?\u201d) So I knew her as a persuasive performer whose incisive instincts were typically matched by scrupulous technique. She makes you feel and know and warm to her characters without ever showing how she does it.", "Because Ms. Rashad doesn\u2019t go in for emotional fireworks. As with Joan and her sword, they are an armament she doesn\u2019t use. Her style, which she honed at the experimental training program at the ", "California Institute of the Arts", " (she grew up in Westchester and \u201cwanted to be in a place my parents would have to take a plane,\u201d she said) is more grounded and more granular. As Kenny Leon, a frequent director and a family friend said: \u201cCondola never reminds you that she\u2019s acting. She engages you because it looks like she\u2019s not.\u201d", "Joan is her first Broadway lead since Juliet. In the fall, when her casting was confirmed, she cleared her schedule and read book after book about Joan of Arc, becoming so fluent in medieval history that she now serves as the play\u2019s unofficial dramaturge. On the day I visited rehearsal, I saw a hand-drawn map of the siege of Orl\u00e9ans. She had sketched it from memory the day before.", "Despite her research and her training, Ms. Rashad is not an analytical actor. She believes that every character exerts a particular energy and that it\u2019s her job to \u201cmerge with that energy and trust that whatever that energy field tells you, you need to be told,\u201d she said. (She said it while wearing a hunk of black tourmaline that was supposed to connect her to her root chakra.)", "So yes, the woo-woo runs deep and it extends to how she sees Joan. \u201cI think she\u2019s someone who had a very high energy quotient,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was someone open to her intentions.\u201d Maybe that all sounds pretty New Age-y, but it\u2019s rare to receive three Tony nominations by the time you turn 30, so the woo-woo seems to be working.", "To merge with Joan, she has connected not to any righteous anger or Time\u2019s Up timeliness, but to the idea of being called, of aligning herself with a larger purpose. \u201cThere is a divine energy and we are all connected to it and we are all made of it,\u201d she said.", "Obviously, Ms. Rashad and her character have different to-do lists. Joan was turning around the Hundred Years\u2019 War. Ms. Rashad is trying to prove herself as a Broadway leading lady. No one is going to burn her. Not literally anyway. But she believes that she has been called to this task just as Joan was called to hers.", "\u201cI\u2019m also someone doing what I think I\u2019m supposed to do,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I do it with intense joy.\u201d"]},

It is a steaming, hyper-air-conditioned, boom-bust-boom town that oozes across 500 relentlessly flat, bayou-laced square miles, the most ethnically and racially diverse, most unionized city in all of Texas, with aching disparities between rich and poor matched in few other places in the country.", "It is the city that oil built. Houston was nothing much until the first gusher came in; that was Spindletop, on the Gulf coast, which blasted Houston and Texas and the whole blessed world into the era of petroleum on Jan. 10, 1901. Since then, Houston has been a city of flamboyant oilmen like Glenn McCarthy and Hugh Roy Cullen, a city of big gestures and big spenders and bigger hair, where minimalism is a dirty word and nobody would dream of dressing down.", "It is the city a whole generation remembers for a single radio transmission in 1969, from an astronaut on the moon to the NASA installation southeast of town: ''Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.'' It is the city that gave birth, with Judge Roy Hofheinz's Astrodome, to the startling idea that baseball and football could be played indoors -- and, of course, to that emerald-green apotheosis of artifice, Astroturf.", "It is a city much more Southern than Western, green and not brown, full of magnolias, live oaks and Spanish moss. The cactus and the tumbleweeds are stored farther west (though Houston's rodeo, on now, is the nation's biggest).", "It is a city that has lent major political figures to the nation. People like Jesse H. Jones, who spearheaded the building of the Houston Ship Channel that made Houston a great port, who owned big chunks of the Texas Commerce Bank and The Houston Chronicle, whom Franklin D. Roosevelt summoned to Washington to run the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which he did so arrogantly that F.D.R. called him ''Jesus H. Jones.'' Men like Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and George Bush, the 41st President. Women like Oveta Culp Hobby, the wartime head of the WAC, and the eloquent Barbara Jordan. Lawyers from elite firms like John B. Connally of Vinson & Elkins and James A. Baker 3d of Baker & Botts, who held no fewer than four Cabinet-level positions.", "It is an ugly, sprawling city, unprotected by zoning laws. Block after barren block of weed-infested parking lots and disintegrating houses stand close by upscale shopping centers and lushly landscaped residential Edens like River Oaks. Too many hours are spent in cars on the congested but indispensable freeways. Yet in its way, it is also a city of art and culture, of exciting museums and distinguished buildings and world-class performing arts organizations. When J. B. Priestley, the English writer, visited Houston in the 1950's, somebody told him it was ''strictly a whisky and trombone town.'' That was before the gentling hand of Dominique de Menil took hold.", "Mrs. de Menil, who died last December at 89, used her large fortune, which came from oil-well technology, to advance the cause of the arts in Houston. Her monuments are a series of buildings in the modestly bohemian section of town called Montrose -- the Rothko Chapel, a nondenominational building housing 14 somber canvases by Mark Rothko, with a Barnett Newman sculpture called ''Broken Obelisk'' nearby; the Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum, one block to the south, built to house a series of 13th-century wall paintings from a votive chapel in Cyprus, and the Menil Collection, a private museum on the scale of the Frick Collection in New York and the Wallace Collection in London.", "The Menil Collection is housed in one of the best museum buildings erected since World War II -- a gray clapboard structure, low-built like the neighborhood surrounding it, with noise-absorbing wooden floors and a clever system of S-shaped light baffles. It is the work of Renzo Piano, co-architect of the Pompidou Center in Paris. Mrs. de Menil (pronounced men-EEL) had a famous eye, and the museum's rooms are filled with stunning objects, ranging from a sixth-century Coptic funeral stele depicting a wide-eyed woman, to exquisite Chi-Wara antelope sculptures from Mali in West Africa, to icons from Novgorod and Venice and Turkey, to 20th-century Surrealist paintings. There is not a clunker in sight.", "All seems serene, but Texas is a land of surprises. The museum is currently playing host (along with the Museum of Fine Arts and the Contemporary Arts Museum) to the Robert Rauschenberg retrospective first shown at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. No sooner had it opened, with the 72-year-old artist, a native of nearby Port Arthur, in attendance, than constables swooped in and hauled away 15 works from his personal collection, to satisfy a $5.5 million judgment against him in a lawsuit brought by a disgruntled Austin art dealer. [The paintings have since been returned to the museum.]", "The Contemporary Arts Museum, which has no permanent collection, and the Museum of Fine Arts, which does, are a few blocks away, so the whole show can be seen with relatively little difficulty. The M.F.A., as the locals call it, has a good collection of Impressionist and modern paintings, highlighted by superior pictures by ''secondary'' artists like Caillebotte, an excellent sculpture garden and substantial Old Master holdings. Material from the latter collections forms part of a current show, ''The Body of Christ in the Art of Europe and New Spain.'' Included is one of Zurbaran's most touching paintings, showing the Lamb of God trussed for sacrifice, as well as works by Durer and Giovanni Bellini.", "A third building for the Museum of Fine Arts is now under construction and scheduled for opening in the spring of 2000. The largest museum of its kind in the Southwest, though not in the same league with the Kimbell in Fort Worth, it has made a particular effort to involve the Hispanic community in its programs.", "The impulse to reach out is also evident on once-a-month family days, with free admission, at Bayou Bend, a mini-Winterthur bequeathed to the museum by Ima Hogg, the unfortunately named daughter of Texas's first native-born Governor. Named for the lazy stream that flows through the 14-acre property, Bayou Bend, a pale pink house built in 1927, stands amid gardens adorned with statues and fountains and notable for their azaleas, now approaching full bloom.", "Reached by a pedestrian suspension bridge that crosses the bayou, the house contains 4,800 English and American objects installed in 28 room settings. There is a silver sugar bowl by Paul Revere and a refined lyre-base epergne by an anonymous English craftsman; portraits by Copley and Charles Willson Peale; furniture by Duncan Phyfe and Benjamin H. Latrobe, a corner cupboard filled with delicate creamware and another with rustic Pennsylvania spatterware.", "Miss Hogg, whose brother Will developed River Oaks, was also a founder of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Once overseen by such notables as Leopold Stokowski and Sir John Barbirolli, it has embellished its reputation under Christoph Eschenbach, whose style has been compared to that of Wilhelm Furtwangler, the great German conductor. Mr. Eschenbach's tenure as music director here ends next May, and no successor has been chosen; he himself is mentioned among potential successors to Claudio Abbado when he leaves the Berlin Philharmonic in 2002.", "Houston also has a first-rate resident stage company, the Alley Theater, in business since 1946, which mounts a dozen or so productions a year on two stages; a nationally known ballet company under Ben Stevenson, its artistic director, and the innovative Houston Grand Opera, with which the ballet shares the new Wortham Theater Center at the heart of the revitalized theater district downtown.", "A little too revitalized: the recently opened Bayou Place, a complex of restaurants and performance spaces, has taxed the area's parking resources. There are also problems with crowd circulation at the otherwise splendid Wortham Theater Center, which houses a 2,200-seat auditorium and a 1,100-seat hall.", "In 25 years as the opera company's general director, David Gockley has championed modern opera, staging many world premieres, and brought semi-operatic American musicals like Porgy and Bess and Showboat into the opera house. One of this year's features was the Francesca Zambello production of Benjamin Britten's Billy Budd, which won awards at Covent Garden and at the Opera Bastille in Paris. It starred the hot young Danish baritone Bo Skovhus, making only his second American operatic appearance after singing in San Francisco earlier.", "If I had to choose Houston's premier art form, it would be architecture. Long before Mr. Piano's eloquently understated building for the Menil Collection went up, long before the Astrodome, there were interesting, mostly modern structures in Houston's three main nodes -- downtown, the Galleria area to the west and the Rice University/Texas Medical Center neighborhood to the south.", "The Rice campus, where building began in 1912, is arranged in a series of quadrangles laid out by Ralph Adams Cram (a new master plan has been prepared by Cesar Pelli). Cram used collegiate Gothic at West Point and Princeton, but for Houston's climate, he decided that a generalized Mediterranean style would be appropriate. Rice's new showplace is the Baker Institute for Public Policy, named for George Bush's Secretary of State and headed by Edward P. Djerejian, a former Ambassador to Israel and Syria. With state-of-the-art conference facilities, it aspires to a place alongside similar centers at Harvard and Princeton.", "Just to the south rise the architecturally mediocre buildings of the medical center, one of the finest in the country. It embraces almost 40 hospitals and medical and nursing schools, including the outstanding M. D. Anderson cancer clinic. Two of the nation's most celebrated heart surgeons, Dr. Michael E. DeBakey and Dr. Denton Cooley, perform operations at the center.", "Downtown, where the city was founded in 1836 by its own Romulus and Remus, the brothers Augustus C. and John K. Allen of New York, is a forest of silver and green and terra-cotta-colored skyscrapers leaping from the flatlands. Among the best are the Enron Building, oval in cross-section, wrapped in a sleek membrane of white aluminum and silvered glass, with a neon ''halo'' around the top at night; the beautifully proportioned Tenneco building, now known as the El Paso Energy Building, by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and the massive 71-story Wells Fargo Plaza, composed of two quarter-round towers, clad in dark green glass and offset from one another by 15 feet.", "But Houston is Philip Johnson country, home to some of his most acclaimed buildings. Pennzoil Place, at 711 Louisiana Street, is the most spectacular of Mr. Johnson's downtown designs, a pair of wedge-shaped towers, their tops lopped off at a 45-degree angle, joined at the base by a glassed-in pedestrian gallery filled with trees, flowers and sunlight. Less successful, if no less distinctive, is the Republic Bank Center at 700 Louisiana Street, built of Swedish red granite. Drawing upon and vastly magnifying the distinctive stepped gables of 16th-century Dutch churches and houses, it jabs an astonishing silhouette into the Texas sky.", "At the feet of these and other buildings is a delightful array of public sculpture by Oldenburg, Calder, Richard Lippold, Henry Moore, Dubuffet, Nevelson (''Frozen Laces,'' 1979) and Miro. The Miro, entitled ''Personage and Birds'' and completed in 1970, is an angular, Tinkertoy-like construction in primary colors that sits below I. M. Pei's Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Bank Building), a granite tower, cut at the corners, at 600 Travis Street.", "Mr. Johnson also designed a quadrangle at University of St. Thomas, not far from the Menil Collection, where he married Jefferson's plan at the University of Virginia to a Miesian esthetic. Right at the top of the main axis, where the rotunda stands in Charlottesville, Mr. Johnson recently completed a geometric tour de force, St. Basil's Chapel, composed of a white cube cut by a black plane and topped with a gold dome.", "Farther west, near the Galleria shopping mall, is yet another must-see Johnson project, designed with John Burgee: the Transco Tower, of which he wrote, ''This will always seem like the tallest building in the world.'' Though only 65 stories, it seems taller because it stands not with other skyscrapers but above low-rise retail buildings; it is, in fact,  the tallest building anywhere outside a city center.", "With its distinctive setbacks, it is reminiscent of the Empire State Building (and of some designs in the famous 1922 Tribune Tower competition in Chicago), executed not in stone but in faceted mirror glass. A revolving beacon on top adds to the Art Deco image.", "From the Alley Theater to Anthony's, From the Rothko Chapel to Pennzoil Place: Where to Cool the Heels and Drench the Senses", "Here is information about Houston:", "Where to Stay", "THE LANCASTER HOTEL, 701 Texas Avenue, in the heart of the downtown theater (and concert and opera) district, was restored to its original 1920's elegance a few years ago; with a cheery, canary-yellow lobby and gleaming antiques in many of its 93 bedrooms, this is one of Houston's gems. Actors and singers love the food in its Bistro and from its 24-hour room service. An unusually friendly staff provides solicitous service.  Rates: For double occupancy, daily weekday rates range from $255 to $300; Friday and Saturday rates range from $145 to $155. (713) 228-9500.", "THE FOUR SEASONS, 1300 Lamar Street, also downtown, is not one of the Canadian-owned chain's superstars, like its sisters in Chicago and Boston. But it's still a first-rate business and leisure hotel, with thick carpets downstairs and memorably comfortable beds upstairs. The hotel's employees try hard, but they seem overstressed on holiday weekends and during conventions. Ten of its 30 floors are devoted to apartments, mostly owned by well-off locals. Rates: For double occupancy, daily weekday rates range from $290 to $355; Friday and Saturday rates range from $145 to $205. (713) 650-1300.", "LUXURY COLLECTION, 1919 Briar Oaks Lane, in the Galleria area. The Hotel Formerly Known as Ritz, they might call it. But in fact, the best of Houston's hotels, having lost the right to use the Ritz-Carlton name, answers the phone, ''Luxury Collection,'' a clumsy moniker at best. Happily, the flowers and the lavish use of marble, plus the high staff-guest ratio, still make you feel as if you're staying on a peer's estate. Rates: For double occupancy, daily weekday rates range from $250 to $2,000; Friday and Saturday rates range from $135 to $2,000. (713) 840-7600.", "THE HOUSTONIAN, 111 North Post Oak Lane, west of downtown, is the most Texan of Houston's top hotels, which may or may not commend it to you. It sits on a woodsy, 22-acre site, and the lobby decor resembles that of a laid-back country lodge. Some of the 291 guest rooms are resplendent, some drab. The health club is top-notch. This was George Bush's voting address during his years in Washington, and where he stayed during trips back to Texas. Rates: Rates: Daily weekday rate based on double occupancy is $249; Friday and Saturday rate is $119. (713) 680-2626.", "LA COLOMBE D'OR, 3410 Montrose Boulevard. A Prairie-style mansion built in 1923 as a residence for Walter Fondren, the founder of Humble Oil, now part of the Exxon group, has been converted into an inn with a pricey Continental restaurant. Just six suites, each filled with antiques and modern art, the Colombe d'Or (Golden Dove) is conveniently near Houston museums, between downtown and the Galleria. It has most of the amenities of far bigger places. Rates: Double occupancy room rates range from $195 to $275; $575 for the penthouse, weekdays or weekends. (713) 524-7999.", "Where to Eat", "CAFE ANNIE, 1728 Post Oak Boulevard, for my money, is the best restaurant in Houston and maybe the best in Texas, which is saying something. Like many good restaurants here, it's incongruously housed in a strip mall, but inside, the mahogany paneling glows luxuriously. Shy, serious and bursting with talent, Robert del Grande, the chef, cooks bold food with roots in both the Mexican and European traditions: coffee-roasted beef, on one hand, and a perfectly seared scallop paired with foie gras on the other. Mimi, his animated wife, deftly directs the dining room. Do not deny yourself the warm chocolate cake with a beret of coffee meringue on top, or a bottle or two from the formidable wine list. (713) 840-1111.", "BRENNAN'S OF HOUSTON, 3300 Smith Street. Houston shares the Gulf and its humidity with New Orleans, so it is not surprising that the Crescent City's Brennan clan has put down roots here, too. At their local outpost, the chef, Carl Walker, adds Texas touches to Creole favorites -- shrimp remoulade with a vinegary corn-jalapeno relish on the side, for example -- and creates brilliant new dishes, like boneless quail on spicy spinach, served with a crawfish enchilada. Sunday brunch, with the jazz singer Yvonne Washington, is a real treat. (713) 522-9711.", "ANTHONY'S, 4007 Westheimer Road. Tony Vallone has been numero uno in Houston dining forever, but for me, the clientele at his flagship, Tony's, with its 25,000-bottle wine list and fondness for truffles, is too preoccupied with who's who and who's wearing what. Not so at Anthony's, his ambitious but relaxed second restaurant. The Pompeian red decor is a bit gaudy, but this is Texas, and we were dazzled by a lunch that included duck pillows with ponzu and pear essence; a small, chewy lobster and crabmeat souffle, and a flawless piece of grilled superfresh red snapper. The good wine list is inexplicably weak in Italian vintages. (713) 961-0552.", "MARK'S, 1658 Westheimer Road. Mark Cox used to cook at Tony's; now he cooks for himself, at Mark's, a crowded, casual spot in a deconsecrated red-brick church. The waiters are still learning, but you'll enjoy the first-course salad of pears, greens and Gorgonzola, and the nursery desserts -- fresh-made strawberry shortcake and a grown-up version of campfire s'mores, with gooey chocolate and marshmallow cream. Try the Chilean sea bass, if it's on the menu, with charred edges and melting flesh, or the pasta with boned shortribs of beef, or (remember, you're in Longhorn country) the classic strip or rib-eye steaks. (713) 523-3800.", "LATIN MENUS. Houstonians love Latin food. You can sample Tex-Mex at the original Ninfa's, 2704 Navigation Street, (713) 228-1175, a Bush family favorite, where the skirt-steak fajitas are still made with care. You can try Tex-Tex at Mr. del Grande's terrific new self-service cafe, Taco Milagro, on Westheimer Road at 2255 Kirby Drive, (713) 522-1999, where the margaritas are unsweetened, the salsas are freshly made each day and the pork barbacoa enchiladas with milagro mole sauce will knock your socks off (if you're wearing any). Or try Latin modern in a wacky setting at Americas, 1800 Post Oak Boulevard, (713) 961-1492; one of the best dishes is taquito de cordoniz (bacon-wrapped quail chunks on a flour tortilla).", "GOODE CO. Then there is Jim Goode, who will show you how to eat well hereabouts for a few bucks. At Goode Co.

Texas Seafood, 2621 Westpark, go for Gulf-fresh shrimp -- in a po' boy sandwich, mesquite-grilled with remoulade sauce or in a campechana, a Mexican-style seafood cocktail, served in a sundae glass with a sauce the color of Maureen O'Hara's hair.

O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200.

The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)", "'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)", "'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from \"The Producers,\" and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)", "'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prizewinner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45).

This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30).

(Brantley)", "'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)", "'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)", "* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)", "'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50).

Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30).

Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed.

This visually rhapsodic film is both profound and profoundly enigmatic. (Holden)", "* 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old, seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy.

Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)", "'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)", "* 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)", "* 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie.

(Scott)", "'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of \"La Boh\u00e8me\" to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)", "'THE RINGER' (PG-13, 94 minutes) A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers. Johnny Knoxville stars, dimly, as a cash-strapped office clerk who tries to rig the Special Olympics. (Nathan Lee)", "'RUMOR HAS IT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Jennifer Aniston, trying her best, traipses through this pointless updating of \"The Graduate,\" in which we learn that Ann Bancroft was really Shirley MacLaine all along, and that Dustin Hoffman grew up to be Kevin Costner. Actually, that makes the movie sound much more interesting than it is.

The cast looks strong, with the ardent tenor Ram\u00f3n Vargas and the splendid soprano Ruth Ann Swenson in the leading roles. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)", "'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Most stagings of Strauss's ever popular operetta, including some revivals of the Met's 1986 Otto Schenk production, seem uncomfortable with the mix of silliness and cynicism in the story of playful infidelities in 1870's Vienna. But the Met's current presentation boasts a winning cast of singers who, for the most part, take the story seriously and give subtle portrayals, especially Bo Skovhus as the ladies' man Gabriel von Eisenstein, Sondra Radvanovsky as his knowing wife, Marlis Petersen as the perky chambermaid Adele and Earle Patriarco as the wily Dr. Falke. Jacques Lacombe conducts a lithe and bracing performance. And with the masterly comedic actor Bill Irwin as the drunken jailer Frosch, the show has plenty of hilarity. Those attending the New Year's Eve gala performance can count on surprise guests showing up to sing during the party scene in Act II. (There will be several cast changes for Wednesday's performance.)

Such is the case for the final two performances this season of Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor,\" starting tonight. There will be a new Lucia, the established Korean soprano Youngok Shin. The young Italian tenor Giuseppe Filianoti, who made an impressive Met debut earlier in the run as Lucia's beloved Edgardo, returns to the cast to sing the role tonight. But Ram\u00f3n Vargas, a veteran bel canto tenor, takes over on Thursday. Edoardo M\u00fcller, who has been conducting the revolving-door \"Lucia\" casts all along, provides some consistency on the podium. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205.

But James Levine is a masterly interpreter of this musically stunning and dramatically compelling work, which he keeps bringing back to the Met in a noble effort to make \"Wozzeck\" essential to the company's repertory. With Mark Lamos's arrestingly abstract 1997 production and an inspired cast headed by Alan Held in the title role, this revival should be seen by all serious opera fans. Mr. Levine elicits a searingly beautiful performance from the great Met orchestra. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220.

A member of the mid-20th-century European Informal art movement based on mentally improvised rather than formal motifs, this Spanish artist is concerned with the body but not in its traditional manifestations. His abstractions and semiabstractions give it a morphing, metaphysical presence; sometimes they involve the depiction of actual body parts, but they rely more on textures, colors and vague forms to evoke the body's ever-shifting sense of itself. But for all the blustery vigor on display, the work gives the viewer a powerful sense of been-there-seen-that. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719.

In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde.

There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details.

For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry.

Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)", "Nobuyoshi Araki, 'Painting Flower and Diaries' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)", "Miki Carmi: 'Psychic Readymades' This young Israeli-born painter makes strangely creepy pictures of oversize bald heads based on those of elderly members of his family. He lavishes painterly attention on veins, age spots, baggy eyes, wrinkles and drooping lips, and he floats the heads like weird balloons against white backgrounds. The paintings are far from beautiful, but their unsettling impact feels right for the often confusing roles that elders play in our psychic lives. Stux, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-1600, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)", "* ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith)", "RYAN DOOLAN: 'RATIONAL GAYZ'  This appealingly arcane debut by a Scottish artist includes small, vaguely photo-based paintings and a photo-performance work involving golf that look great in this austere but cozy new gallery. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, at 29th Street, (212) 481-0362, through Jan. 11. (Smith)", "Matthew McCaslin This inventive sculptor plays with the tension between nature and technology. A working fountain has water flowing from sunflowers made of wide showerheads and copper pipe planted in a claw-foot bathtub. And the arrangement of a cuckoo clock and a flat-screen video view of peaceful lake waters on a natural plywood wall slyly enhances the faux-rustic ambience. Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)", "GORDON MOORE Elegantly understated paintings animated by ghostly linear figures and their shadows, which gambol before the large-paned grid of -- well, maybe a factory window. Composed of lines of different lengths and colors and various thicknesses, these antic figures seem to vibrate on and under the paintings' lightly brushed surfaces. Mr. Moore rings many intricate variations on his basic format, which, while it commits to the visible, manages to engage the mystery of what lies beyond it. Betty Cuningham Gallery, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 242-2772, through Jan. 28. (Glueck)", "Annysa Ng: 'Love & Fear' A beautiful new gallery occupying two floors of a tiny brick house presents works of postmodernist faux-antiquity by a Chinese artist who has studied in Hong Kong, New York and Germany. The large, Victorian-style silhouettes are not without possibilities, though perhaps they are too Kara Walker-like; the hanging assemblages made of braided hair, fabric and found objects have an erotically stirring poetic delicacy. Holasek Weir, 502 West 27th Street, (212) 367-9093, through Jan. 20. (Johnson)", "Nicholas Nixon: 'Life and Times' Among other photographs from the last 30 years, this show features Mr. Nixon's famous \"Brown Sisters,\" a set of group portraits of four sisters made annually, starting in 1975. It is almost painfully touching to see the beautiful siblings evolve from teenagers to late middle age. And then you begin to wonder how long this can go on before one of the five participants will no longer be available. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)", "* LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through Jan. 21. (Smith)", "PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson)", "Felix Schramm: 'Comber' It looks as if a tornado ripped parts off an ordinary house and slammed them into the gallery, creating a Cubist-Expressionist-style environment that was, in fact, carefully designed and assembled by this young and innovative German sculptor. Grimm/Rosenfeld, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-2388, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)", "Catherine Sullivan: 'The Chittendens' In a multiprojection video work, professional actors, none speaking, perform scripted sequences of actions. At first the effect is comical, but humor is overridden by an academic mission to deconstruct codes of behavior in film, theater and real life. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)", "Galleries: SoHo and TriBeCa", "* JIM DRAIN and ARA PETERSON: 'HYPNOGOOGIA' With a kaleidoscopic, mirrored DVD installation and multifaceted sculptures that resemble gaudy, 12-foot-high soccer balls, two of contemporary art's most interesting collaborators have masterminded a kind of wonderland of digital and analog psychedelia. The best piece is best experienced by descending on a ladder into a kind of rabbit hole. The total effect is amazing, if a little vacant. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, through Jan. 28. (Smith)", "'The Last Generation' More or less obscurely, this group show addresses how digital forms of communication and representation are altering human experience. Best are Kota Ezawa's black-and-white animation of a scene from \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"; Jan Mancuska's text and video sculpture; motorized military hats doing synchronized movements, by Malachi Farrell; and Laurent Montaron's combination of a digital photograph of someone sleeping and an audio system that plays on headphones the sounds a sleeper makes. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)", "Last Chance", "* THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS' Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)", "* MET: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT' Hands down the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, s\u00e9ance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. (See above.) Closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)", "* Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS' Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. (See above.) Closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)", "NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: BRIAN JUNGEN Aware that the Nike Air Jordan sneakers worn by the basketball star Michael Jordan are a fetish item for youth throughout the world, Mr. Jungen, a young British Columbian partly of Northwest Coast Indian descent, has cleverly refashioned these trophy sneakers into ceremonial masks that strikingly suggest those produced by Northwest Coast tribes..

Primary Fights Worry Party Leaders"], "article_text": ["BLOOMINGTON, Ind. \u2014 In many parts of the country, Republican candidates are trying to put distance between themselves and President Trump. In the Indiana Senate primary, the bruising fight is over which candidate is the more authentically Trumpian.", "As the May 8 primary election approaches, the race here has taken a nasty turn, with candidates attacking one another as insufficiently aligned with the president, or way too late to Team Trump. Some Republicans worry that the tenor has the potential to bloody the winner so badly that he will be weakened in the general election contest against Senator Joe Donnelly, one of this election year\u2019s most vulnerable Democrats.", "\u201cOf course it helps Donnelly,\u201d said Robert T. Grand, a lawyer and powerful figure in state politics for decades. \u201cAny division in the Republican Party helps Donnelly.\u201d", "The Indiana primary is among several, including those in West Virginia and Wisconsin, where Republicans are locked in nominating battles in states Mr. Trump won in 2016 and where the party has hoped to add to its slender two-seat majority. In Wisconsin, a Marine Corps veteran and political newcomer, Kevin Nicholson, is taking on a state senator, Leah Vukmir, for the right to challenge the incumbent senator, Tammy Baldwin. Both have deep-pocketed donors ready to bankroll an extended primary fight.", "In West Virginia, a half-dozen Republicans want to challenge Senator Joe Manchin III, but three have emerged as the most formidable in a drawn-out battle, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, Representative Evan Jenkins ", "and the former mining executive Don Blankenship", ", who went to prison for the deadly Upper Big Branch coal mining disaster in 2010 but emerged unrepentant.", "Winning in all three of these states has taken on added urgency after the unanticipated retirements of Republican senators in Tennessee, Arizona and Mississippi left open seats that could suddenly be competitive.", "In Indiana, Representative Todd Rokita started airing a television ad this week that labeled one of his opponents, Representative Luke Messer, a \u201cNever Trump lobbyist\u201d and the other, Mike Braun, a business executive, as voting for either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. His slogan: \u201cDefeat the Elite.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate three-way race,\u201d said John Hammond, a lawyer and member of the Republican National Committee from Indiana, \u201cand everybody will probably go right up to the line with rhetoric and negative message. It\u2019s happening and it\u2019s intensifying.\u201d", "He added, \u201cAll the opposition research will have been done for Joe Donnelly at that point.\u201d", "Mr. Rokita said he had no concerns that the attacks would help the incumbent Democrat. \u201cI think this primary is very cleansing,\u201d he said. \u201cI want voters to know about these two guys. And I want them to know about me.\u201d", "Referring to two previous Republican presidential candidates, John R. Kasich and Mitt Romney, Mr. Rokita added: \u201cMesser at this point is like all losing candidates, like Kasich or Romney, \u2018if you beat up on me, we are all going to lose.\u2019 Absolutely wrong. I am not waiting for Joe Donnelly to stick a knife in Luke Messer or Mike Braun in November. I am getting it all out now. Because Donnelly will stick in a knife in them.\u201d", "That kind of language has prompted concern among some of the state\u2019s most influential Republicans.", "Mr. Grand, who supports Mr. Messer, was particularly critical of Mr. Rokita trying to claim a populist mantle by deriding so-called elites. Mr. Rokita\u2019s \u201celites\u201d are something else to Mr. Grand: \u201cPeople that know what\u2019s good for the Republican Party, yes, longstanding Republicans, yes. People who know how to elect Republican candidates.\u201d", "\u201cOr,\u201d he asked, does Mr. Rokita \u201cwant to go back to the group that gave us Mourdock?\u201d", "That was a reference to Richard E. Mourdock, a candidate whose backing from Tea Party groups and national conservative organizations six years ago led to the ", "defeat of a ", " longtime incumbent Republican, Senator Richard G. Lugar", ", in the Indiana primary. Mr. Mourdock went on to ", "lose to Mr. Donnelly", ".", "Mr. Mourdock painted Mr. Lugar as out of touch with the state, and emphasized the fact that he lived in Virginia, a theme that Mr. Rokita has reprised against Mr. Messer. He has also made an issue of the fact that Mr. Messer\u2019s wife, a lawyer, is on the payroll of an Indianapolis suburb even though she, too, lives in Virginia.", "Mr. Messer, the father of two teenage daughters, said he was raised by a single parent and felt it important to be closer to his children, and said voters would understand.", "A competitive primary or multicandidate field can sometimes actually reflect party strength and enthusiasm, but if the contest becomes too negative, the party can suffer.", "\u201cWhere there are particularly competitive or divisive primaries, it is bad for the parties when they go to the general,\u201d said Andrew B. Hall, a political scientist at Stanford University who has studied the subject. \u201cThings are getting put on record that make you look weak. You alienate some of your own base. You\u2019ve expended some of your resources.\u201d", "Mr. Donnelly has no serious opposition for the Democratic nomination, though he is already under assault from Republican-aligned groups that are spending millions of dollars to defeat him.", "Each of the Republican candidates has tried to emphasize ties to Mr. Trump in ", "a state ", " the president won by 19 percentage points", ". Mr. Braun claims a Trump-like background, having built a logistics company in southern Indiana that now employs 850 people and gave him wealth that he can spend heavily on his own campaign.", "He said Mr. Messer and Mr. Rokita were professional politicians, lawyers who \u201cnever practiced\u201d but always had their eyes on the next political rung. Mr. Braun served briefly in the State Legislature.", "In a candidate debate, in which Mr. Braun wore jeans and a denim shirt, he made the case harshly. In a new ad, he uses humor, carrying cardboard cutouts of the two men \u2014 dressed identically in white shirt, red tie and dark suit \u2014 and asked voters if they could tell the difference between them.", "\u201cWhere is your real world experience?\u201d Mr. Braun said in an interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any.\u201d He added: \u201cThey are creating a large avenue up the middle between two career politicians. That was a gift that kept on giving.\u201d", "Mr. Braun dismissed Mr. Rokita as a \u201csmash mouth.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019ll do and say things that might impress,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he\u2019s trying to act like Trump it\u2019s kind of a poor impression.\u201d", "He also said there could be lingering damage: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got sharp elbows, that creates a long memory for the people hit by those elbows.\u201d", "He rejected Mr. Rokita\u2019s charge that he was a recent Republican convert, saying he had never voted for a Democrat for a federal office.", "Mr. Messer, whose campaign so far has been the most measured of the three, accused Mr. Rokita of \u201ctrying to make things up.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Mr. Messer said. \u201cYou can\u2019t find one interview in the entire campaign where I didn\u2019t make the point that we need to elect President Trump. Do I agree with every single President Trump tweet? No. I\u2019ve expressed a few times my concerns about the president. But throughout, I have supported him and voted for the president in the primary.\u201d", "All the candidates embrace some of the president\u2019s core positions, like the need for a wall along the Mexican border, and all pledge to be a solid voice for the president\u2019s agenda.", "Mr. Rokita\u2019s opponents say his voting record suggests otherwise: Mr. Rokita voted against the budget deal that Mr. Trump signed this year", "He said he did so because the bill contained too much federal spending. But, Mr. Rokita added, because he supported Mr. Trump before his rivals and has the endorsement of people who ran the Trump campaign in the state, he can disagree with the president, something he said Mr. Messer could not do.", "\u201cNow he has to do everything he can to pander to the president and Mike Pence,\u201d Mr. Rokita said. \u201cOh, the president wanted this terrible spending bill. Whereas I, in a very healthy way, can say no to things like the spending bill and still be on the side of the president.\u201d", "Even with all the friction in the primary so far, if there are safe places for the midterm elections to be a referendum on Mr. Trump, Indiana is surely among them. Republicans will pour extraordinary resources into the effort to oust Mr. Donnelly, and the president and Vice President Mike Pence, the former Indiana governor, will be able to give the senate nominee added firepower.", "That gives Republicans comfort that they can endure a fractious primary. \u201cPeople are very energized,\u201d Mr. Grand said. \u201cThey are not playing into this thing that \u201918 is going to be a bad year.\u201d"]},

Mr. Copley, 39 and a registered Republican, was \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d with ", "Donald J. Trump", " then, he said. But over time, in a paradox of the Bible Belt, Mr. Copley, a deeply religious father of three, put his faith in a trash-talking, thrice-married Manhattan real estate mogul as a savior for coal country \u2014 and America.", "\u201cGod has used unjust people to do his will,\u201d Mr. Copley said, explaining his vote.", "Now coal country is reckoning with an inconvenient truth: Experts say Mr. Trump\u2019s expansive campaign promise to \u201cput our miners back to work\u201d will be ", "very difficult to keep", ". Yet as he prepares to move into the Oval Office, Appalachians are eyeing Washington with a feeling they have not had in years: hope.", "The American market for coal is shrinking, industry analysts agree. Utility companies have drastically reduced their reliance on coal, in part because of ", "President Obama", "\u2019s aggressive regulations to cut emissions from power plants, but also because ", "natural gas", " is cheaper. Nationally, about 300 coal-fired power plants have closed since 2008, according to the National Mining Association, a trade group.", "Many of those plants \u2014 including one in nearby Louisa, Ky., where a giant cooling tower was ", "recently demolished", " after the plant converted from coal to natural gas \u2014 are not coming back. Politicians and economists agree that what Appalachia really needs is ", "a diversified economy", ", a goal that has eluded Mr. Obama and state and local politicians.", "But in this land of staggering beauty and economic pain, Trump backers said over and over again that while coal might never be what it once was, the businessman they helped send to the White House could indeed put them back to work \u2014 if not in mining, then in some other industry.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think he can ever fulfill all the promises he made even in four or eight years,\u201d Danny Maynard, 59, said after Bible study at the Chattaroy Missionary Baptist Church. Mr. Maynard lost his job at a coal company last year. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re headed in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wants to make America great again.\u201d", "Mr. Trump pummeled Mrs. Clinton in coal country. Here in West Virginia, he won every county and took ", "69 percent of the vote", ", a landslide also fueled by his promise to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices who would roll back abortion rights. As Mr. Copley put it, \u201cCoal is secondary to me.\u201d", "It is difficult for outsiders to fathom how deeply faith and work are intertwined here, or the economic and psychological depression that sets in when an entire region loses the only livelihood many of its people have ever known. Coal has always been boom and bust; its decline began long before Mr. Obama took office. But in West Virginia alone, 12,000 coal industry jobs have been lost during his tenure.", "At the Huddle House on Route 119, Kayla Burger, 32, a waitress, has worked three jobs since her husband lost his; they take home less than a quarter of the roughly $100,000 he used to earn. She took an offer for miners\u2019 wives to train as phlebotomists, but with so many miners out of work, the phlebotomy market was flooded. She also substitute teaches and cooks at the school.", "They have given up cellphones and sold their boat; one car has been repossessed; the only reason they still have their house, she said, is that they saw layoffs coming and saved money. Her husband, who cares for the children, has experienced depression. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel like a man,\u201d Ms. Burger said. Her father was a miner, too; he and her mother drive tractor-trailers now.", "In Williamson \u2014 population roughly 3,100, down from 4,300 two decades ago \u2014 everyone has a story.", "The city used to market itself as \u201cthe heart of the billion-dollar coal fields,\u201d but it now wraps its tourism pitches around the Hatfield-McCoy trails that run through the nearby mountains. (\u201cWe\u2019re the 50-cent coal fields,\u201d said Natalie Taylor, the executive director of the Tug Valley Chamber of Commerce.) Williamson\u2019s downtown, on the border with eastern Kentucky, sits between the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River and the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks.", "At the newly opened pulmonary clinic here for patients with black lung disease, Patricia Sigmon, a respiratory therapist, has been caught in the trickle-down. With coal paying less in severance tax to the state, there is less funding for schools. Her husband, a school bus driver in nearby Boone County, was forced to take a $4,000 cut in pay.", "Larry Gannon, 61, retired early from his job as a coal processing plant foreman so that a younger man could keep his. Mr. Copley\u2019s wife, Lauren, has a photography business, which is how they make do. They used to have \u201cCadillac\u201d health coverage; now they have ", "Medicaid", ".", "So when scientists, and Democrats like Al Gore, ", "warn", " that Mr. Trump will endanger the planet, people hear that as something off in the future; feeding your family is here and now. Many say Mother Nature will have her way.", "\u201cWhen I was growing up, they said we were in an ice age,\u201d said Kyle Lovern, the managing editor of ", "The Williamson Daily News", ". He voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and Mr. Trump this year.", "Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in West Virginia, where anger at politicians has been building for years. Mr. Copley remembers the Democrats who held power here \u2014 men like Senator Robert C. Byrd, who died in 2010 and ", "whose name", " is on buildings and roads built with the tax dollars he brought home \u2014 and wonders why they did not see the coal bust coming and work to diversify the economy.", "\u201cWe\u2019re a forgotten people,\u201d Ms. Taylor said, explaining why it did not take much for Mr. Trump to win coal country\u2019s trust. \u201cHe mentions West Virginia, he mentions the coal workers, and that was pretty much all he had to do to seal this deal.\u201d", "Now that the deal has been sealed, Mr. Trump has put a ", "climate change contrarian", " and friend of the coal industry in charge of his Environmental Protection Agency transition team. Environmentalists are horrified, but Bill Raney, the president of the West Virginia Coal Association, a trade group, is thrilled.", "\u201cJust a positive attitude in the White House is enormously important,\u201d he said.", "While American utilities are shunning coal, Mr. Raney says, some mines are shipping coal overseas. He sees promise in clean coal technology and says that \u201csome plants can get back on line\u201d if Mr. Trump dismantles Mr. Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. But that will take time. The plan is tied up in litigation; the Supreme Court was expected to hear the case next year.", "Mr. Copley, and many others, are waiting \u2014 and contemplating a divided nation.", "Mr. Copley is now a mini-celebrity here. ", "Yahoo News", " declared that he had helped shape the race and invited his family to its studios in New York on election night. The family had never been to the city. Mr. Copley did not like having to explain to his children why anti-Trump protesters were shouting profanities in Times Square, and he later felt put off by the cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d reading a statement he deemed \u201crude\u201d to Mike Pence, the vice president-elect.", "At home, though, Mr. Copley sees nuance. His children\u2019s drama teacher, Dusty Smith, 36, who has purple and blue streaks in her hair, said she had voted for Mr. Trump because he seemed \u201cvery humble\u201d on ", "\u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\u201d", " At the Thanksgiving play Ms. Smith directed, an African-American teenager delivered a spoken-word homage to racial harmony. Watching it, Mr. Copley worried that his black friends would think he was racist because of his vote.", "People have asked Mr. Copley if he will run for public office; if God leads him to, he said, he will. As for Mr. Trump, he will give the president-elect time: \u201cHe\u2019s got four years.\u201d"]},

A gun battle between mine company officials and unionized workers in 1920 brought the nickname \u201cBloody Mingo,\u201d fodder today for history tourists and TV serials.

A pair of drug addicts have been arrested.", "Williamson itself, a town of 3,000, is a picture of social and economic decay. Unemployment, at 12 percent, is more than twice the United States average. Cash-for-gold stores crowd alongside lawyers\u2019 offices and gun dealerships. Rates of heroin overdoses and obesity are among the highest in America. Many residents scrape by on food stamps.", "In the surrounding hills, abandoned coal mines hum with the noise of ventilation pumps still circulating oxygen through the empty shafts, in the hope that they might one day be reopened.", "Yet the people of Mingo County have forged their own brand of resilience, one born of the tight-knit rural values that draw embattled citizens together. For some, that means planning for a better future: Dr. Dino Beckett, a local physician, has spearheaded initiatives to grow healthy food locally and reduce diabetes. For others, it means lifting a defiant finger to the outside world.", "At the ", "Regional Church", " in Delbarton, 10 miles from Williamson, Sunday services were both exuberant and solemn, a mark of the conservative Christianity that holds strong here.

With salaries starting at $70,000 a year, a job in the mines was long considered the local jackpot. Mingo County\u2019s breathtaking valleys and hollers \u2014 narrow creeks bordered by high hills \u2014 are lined with spacious homes, swimming pools and gleaming vehicles.

People are more likely to use words like \u201cbitchy\u201d and \u201chostile\u201d to describe female anger, while male anger is more likely to be described as \u201cstrong.\u201d Kring reported that men are more likely to express their anger by physically assaulting objects or verbally attacking other people, while women are more likely to cry when they get angry, as if their bodies are forcibly returning them to the appearance of the emotion \u2014 sadness \u2014 with which they are most commonly associated.", "A 2016 study found that it took longer for people to correctly identify the gender of female faces displaying an angry expression, as if the emotion had wandered out of its natural habitat by finding its way to their features. A 1990 study conducted by the psychologists Ulf Dimberg and L.O. Lundquist found that when female faces ", "are", " recognized as angry, their expressions are rated as more hostile than comparable expressions on the faces of men \u2014 as if their violation of social expectations had already made their anger seem more extreme, increasing its volume beyond what could be tolerated.", "In \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d her account of the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton describes the pressure not to come across as angry during the course of her entire political career \u2014 \u201ca lot of people recoil from an angry woman,\u201d she writes \u2014 as well as her own desire not to be consumed by anger after she lost the race, \u201cso that the rest of my life wouldn\u2019t be spent like Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens\u2019s \u2018Great Expectations,\u2019 rattling around my house obsessing over what might have been.\u201d The specter of Dickens\u2019s ranting spinster \u2014 spurned and embittered in her crumbling wedding dress, plotting her elaborate revenge \u2014 casts a long shadow over every woman who dares to get mad.", "If an angry woman makes people uneasy, then her more palatable counterpart, the sad woman, summons sympathy more readily. She often looks beautiful in her suffering: ennobled, transfigured, elegant. Angry women are messier. Their pain threatens to cause more collateral damage. It\u2019s as if the prospect of a woman\u2019s anger harming other people threatens to rob her of the social capital she has gained by being wronged. We are most comfortable with female anger when it promises to regulate itself, to refrain from recklessness, to stay civilized.", "Consider the red-carpet clip of Uma Thurman that went viral in November, during the initial swell of sexual-harassment accusations. The clip doesn\u2019t actually show Thurman\u2019s getting angry. It shows her very conspicuously ", "refusing", " to get angry. After commending the Hollywood women who had spoken out about their experiences of sexual assault, she said that she was \u201cwaiting to feel less angry\u201d before she spoke herself. It was curious that Thurman\u2019s public declarations were lauded as a triumphant vision of female anger, because the clip offered precisely the version of female anger that we\u2019ve long been socialized to produce and accept: not the spectacle of female anger unleashed, but the spectacle of female anger restrained, sharpened to a photogenic point. By withholding the specific story of whatever made her angry, Thurman made her anger itself the story \u2014 and the raw force of her struggle ", "not", " to get angry on that red carpet summoned the force of her anger even more powerfully than its full explosion would have, just as the monster in a movie is most frightening when it only appears offscreen.", "This was a question I began to consider quite frequently as the slew of news stories accrued last fall: How much female anger has been lurking offscreen? How much anger has been biding its time and biting its tongue, wary of being pathologized as hysteria or dismissed as paranoia? And what of my own vexed feelings about all this female anger? Why were they even vexed? It seemed a failure of moral sentiment or a betrayal of feminism, as if I were somehow siding with the patriarchy, or had internalized it so thoroughly I couldn\u2019t even spot the edges of its toxic residue. I intuitively embraced and supported ", "other", " women\u2019s anger but struggled to claim my own. Some of this had to do with the ways I\u2019d been lucky \u2014 I had experienced all kinds of gendered aggression, but nothing equivalent to the horror stories so many other women have lived through. But it also had to do with an abiding aversion to anger that still festered like rot inside me. In what I had always understood as self-awareness \u2014 ", "I don\u2019t get angry. I get sad", " \u2014 I came to see my own complicity in the same logic that has trained women to bury their anger or perform its absence.", "For a long", " time, I was drawn to \u201csad lady\u201d icons: the scribes and bards of loneliness and melancholy. As a certain kind of slightly morbid, slightly depressive, slightly self-intoxicated, deeply predictable, pre-emptively apologetic literary fan-girl, I loved Sylvia Plath. I was obsessed with her own obsession with her own blood (\u201cWhat a thrill ... that red plush\u201d) and drawn to her suffering silhouette: a woman abandoned by her cheating husband and ensnared by the gendered double standards of domesticity. I attached myself to the mantra of her autobiographical avatar Esther Greenwood, who lies in a bathtub in \u201cThe Bell Jar,\u201d bleeding during a rehearsal of a suicide attempt, and later stands at a funeral listening \u201cto the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.\u201d Her attachment to pain \u2014 her own and others\u2019 \u2014 was also a declaration of identity. I wanted to get it tattooed on my arm.", "Whenever I listened to my favorite female singers, it was easier for me to sing along to their sad lyrics than their angry ones. It was easier to play Ani DiFranco on repeat, crooning about heartbreak \u2014 \u201cDid I ever tell you how I stopped eating/when you stopped calling me?\u201d \u2014 than it was to hear her fury, and her irritation at the ones who stayed sad and quiet in her shadow: \u201cSome chick says/Thank you for saying all the things I never do/I say, you know/The thanks I get is to take all the [expletive] for you.\u201d", "I kept returning to the early novels of Jean Rhys, whose wounded heroines flopped around dingy rented rooms in various European capitals, seeking solace from their heartbreak, staining cheap comforters with their wine. Sasha, the heroine of \u201cGood Morning, Midnight\u201d \u2014 the most famous of these early picaresques of pain \u2014 resolves to drink herself to death and manages, mainly, to cry her way across Paris. She cries at cafes, at bars, in her lousy hotel room. She cries at work. She cries in a fitting room. She cries on the street. She cries near the Seine. The closing scene of the novel is a scene of terrifying passivity: She lets a wraithlike man into her bed because she can\u2019t summon the energy to stop him, as if she has finally lost touch with her willpower entirely. In life, Rhys was infamous for her sadness, what one friend called \u201cher gramophone-needle-stuck-in-a-groove thing of going over and over miseries of one sort and another.\u201d Even her biographer called her one of the greatest self-pity artists in the history of English fiction.", "It took me years to understand how deeply I had misunderstood these women. I\u2019d missed the rage that fueled Plath\u2019s poetry like a ferocious gasoline, lifting her speakers (sometimes literally) into flight: \u201cNow she is flying/More terrible than she ever was, red/Scar in the sky, red comet/Over the engine that killed her \u2014 the mausoleum, the wax house.\u201d The speaker becomes a scar \u2014 this irrefutable evidence of her own pain \u2014 but this scar, in turn, becomes a comet: terrible and determined, soaring triumphant over the instruments of her own supposed destruction. I\u2019d always been preoccupied with the pained disintegration of Plath\u2019s speakers, but once I started looking, I saw the comet trails of their angry resurrections everywhere, delivering their unapologetic fantasies of retribution: \u201cOut of the ash/I rise with my red hair/And I eat men like air.\u201d", "I\u2019d loved Rhys for nearly a decade before I read her final novel, \u201cWide Sargasso Sea,\u201d a reimagining of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s \u201cJane Eyre\u201d whose whole plot leads inexorably toward an act of destructive anger: The mad first wife of Mr. Rochester burns down the English country manor where she has been imprisoned in the attic for years. In this late masterpiece, the heroines of Rhys\u2019s early novels \u2014 heartbroken, drunk, caught in complicated choreographies of passivity \u2014 are replaced by an angry woman with a torch, ready to use the master\u2019s tools to destroy his house.", "It wasn\u2019t that these authors were writing exclusively about female anger rather than female sorrow; their writing holds both states of feeling. \u201cWide Sargasso Sea\u201d excavates the deep veins of sadness running beneath an otherwise opaque act of angry destruction, and Plath\u2019s poems are invested in articulating the complicated affective braids of bitterness, irony, anger, pride and sorrow that others often misread as monolithic sadness. \u201cThey explain people like that by saying that their minds are in watertight compartments, but it never seemed so to me,\u201d Rhys herself once wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s all washing about, like the bilge in the hold of a ship.\u201d", "It has always been easier to shunt female sadness and female anger into the \u201cwatertight compartments\u201d of opposing archetypes, rather than acknowledging the ways they run together in the cargo hold of every female psyche. Near the end of the new biopic \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d Tonya Harding\u2019s character explains: \u201cAmerica, they want someone to love, but they want someone to hate.\u201d The timing of the film\u2019s release, in late 2017, seemed cosmically apt. It resurrected a definitional prototype of female anger \u2014 at least for many women like me, who came of age during the 1990s \u2014 at the precise moment that so many women were starting to get publicly, explicitly, unapologetically angry.", "Harding was an object of fascination not just because of the soap opera she dangled before the public gaze \u2014 supposedly conspiring with her ex-husband and an associate to plan an attack on her rival figure skater Nancy Kerrigan \u2014 but also because she and Kerrigan provided a yin and yang of primal female archetypes. As a vision of anger \u2014 uncouth and unrestrained, the woman everyone loved to hate, exploding at the judges when they didn\u2019t give her the scores she felt she deserved \u2014 Harding was the perfect foil for the elegant suffering of Kerrigan, sobbing in her lacy white leotard. Together they were an impossible duo to turn away from: the sad girl and the mad girl. Wounded and wicked. Their binary segregated one vision of femininity we adored (rule-abiding, delicate, hurting) from another we despised (trashy, whiny, angry). Harding was strong; she was poor; she was pissed off; and eventually, in the narrative embraced by the public, she turned those feelings into violence. But \u201cI, Tonya\u201d illuminates what so little press coverage at the time paid attention to: the perfect storm of violence that produced Harding\u2019s anger in the first place \u2014 her mother\u2019s abuse and her husband\u2019s. Which is to say: No woman\u2019s anger is an island.", "When the Harding and Kerrigan controversy swept the media, I was 10 years old. Their story was imprinted onto me as a series of reductive but indelible brush strokes: one woman shouting at the media, another woman weeping just beyond the ice rink. But after watching \u201cI, Tonya\u201d and realizing how much these two women had existed to me as ", "ideas", ", rather than as women, I did what any reasonable person would do: I Googled \u201cTonya and Nancy\u201d obsessively. I Googled: \u201cDid Tonya ever apologize to Nancy?\u201d I Googled: \u201cTonya Harding boxing career?\u201d and discovered that it effectively began with her 2002 \u201cCelebrity Boxing\u201d match against Paula Jones \u2014 two women paid to perform the absurd caricatures of vengeful femininity the public had projected onto them, the woman who cried harassment versus the woman who bashed kneecaps.", "In the documentaries I watched, I found Harding difficult to like. She comes off as a self-deluded liar with a robust victim complex, focused on her own misfortune to the exclusion of anyone else\u2019s. But what does the fact that I found Harding \u201cdifficult to like\u201d say about the kind of women I\u2019m comfortable liking? Did I want the plotline in which the woman who has survived her own hard life \u2014 abusive mother, abusive husband, enduring poverty \u2014 also emerges with a \u201clikable\u201d personality: a plucky spirit, a determined work ethic and a graceful, self-effacing relationship to her own suffering?", "The vision of Harding in \u201cI, Tonya\u201d is something close to the opposite of self-effacing. The film even includes a fantastical re-enactment of the crime, which became popularly known as the \u201cwhack heard round the world,\u201d in which Harding stands over Kerrigan\u2019s cowering body, baton raised high above her head, striking her bloody knee until Harding turns back toward the camera \u2014 her face defiant and splattered with Kerrigan\u2019s blood. Even though the attack was actually carried out by a hired hit man, this imagined scene distills the version of the story that America became obsessed with, in which one woman\u2019s anger leaves another woman traumatized.", "But America\u2019s obsession with these two women wasn\u2019t that simple. There was another story that rose up in opposition. In this shadow story, Harding wasn\u2019t a monster but a victim, an underdog unfairly vilified, and Kerrigan was a crybaby who made too much of her pain. In a 2014 Deadspin essay, \u201cConfessions of a Tonya Harding Apologist,\u201d Lucy Madison wrote: \u201cShe represented the fulfillment of an adolescent revenge fantasy \u2014 ", "my", " adolescent revenge fantasy, the one where the girl who doesn\u2019t quite fit in manages to soar over everyone\u2019s [expletive] without giving up a fraction of her prerogative \u2014 and I could not have loved her more.\u201d When Kerrigan crouched sobbing on the floor near the training rink, right after the attack (Newsweek described it as \u201cthe sound of one dream breaking\u201d), she famously cried out: \u201cWhy? Why? Why?\u201d But when Newsweek ran the story on its cover, it printed the quote as: \u201cWhy Me?\u201d The single added word turned her shock into keening self-pity.", "These two seemingly contradictory versions of Harding and Kerrigan \u2014 raging bitch and innocent victim, or bad-girl hero and whiny crybaby \u2014 offered the same cutout dolls dressed in different costumes. The entitled weeper was the unacceptable version of a stoic victim; the scrappy underdog was the acceptable version of a raging bitch. At first glance, they seemed like opposite stories, betraying our conflicted collective relationship to female anger \u2014 that it\u2019s either heroic or uncontrollably destructive \u2014 and our love-hate relationship with victimhood itself: We love a victim to hurt for but grow irritated by one who hurts too much. Both stories, however, insisted upon the same segregation: A woman couldn\u2019t hurt and be hurt at once. She could be either angry or sad. It was easier to outsource those emotions to the bodies of separate women than it was to acknowledge that they reside together in the body of every woman.", "Ten years ago", " in Nicaragua, a man punched me in the face on a dark street. As I sat on a curb afterward \u2014 covered in my own blood, holding a cold bottle of beer against my broken nose \u2014 a cop asked me for a physical description of the man who had just mugged me. Maybe 20 minutes later, a police vehicle pulled up: a pickup truck outfitted with a barred cage in the back. There was a man in the cage.", "\u201cIs this him?\u201d the cop asked. I shook my head, horrified, acutely aware of my own power \u2014 realizing, in that moment, that simply saying ", "I was hurt", " could take away a stranger\u2019s liberty. I was a white woman, a foreigner volunteering at a local school, and I felt ashamed of my own familiar silhouette: a vulnerable white woman crying ", "danger", " at anonymous men lurking in the shadows. I felt scared and embarrassed to be scared. I felt embarrassed that everyone was making such a fuss. One thing I did not feel was anger.", "That night, my sense of guilt \u2014 my shame at being someone deemed worthy of protection, and at the ways that protection might endanger others \u2014 effectively blocked my awareness of my own anger. It was as if my privilege outweighed my vulnerability, and that meant I wasn\u2019t entitled to any anger at all. But if I struggled to feel entitled to anger that night in Nicaragua, I have since come to realize that the real entitlement has never been anger; it has always been its absence. The aversion to anger I had understood in terms of temperament or intention was, in all honesty, also a luxury. When the black feminist writer and activist Audre Lorde described her anger as a lifelong response to systemic racism, she insisted upon it as a product of the larger social landscape rather than private emotional ecology: \u201cI have lived with that anger, on that anger, beneath that anger, on top of that anger ... for most of my life.\u201d", "After the Uma Thurman clip went viral, the Trinidadian journalist Stacy-Marie Ishmael tweeted: \u201c*interesting* which kinds of women are praised for public anger. I\u2019ve spent my whole career reassuring people this is just my face.\u201d Michelle Obama was dogged by the label of \u201cangry black woman\u201d for the duration of her husband\u2019s time in office. Scientific research has suggested that the experience of racism leads African-Americans to suffer from higher blood pressure than white Americans and has hypothesized that this disparity arises from the fact that they accordingly experience more anger and are simultaneously expected to suppress it. The tennis superstar Serena Williams was fined over $80,000 for an angry outburst against a lineswoman at the U.S. Open in 2009: \u201cI swear to God, I\u2019ll [expletive] take this ball and shove it down your [expletive] throat.\u201d Gretchen Carlson, a Fox anchor at the time, called another one of Williams\u2019s angry outbursts in 2011 a symbol of \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with our society today.\u201d Carlson, of course, has since come to embody a certain brand of female empowerment: One of the leading voices accusing the late Fox News chairman Roger Ailes of sexual harassment, she recently published a book called \u201cBe Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back.\u201d But the portrait on its cover \u2014 of a fair-skinned, blond-haired woman smiling slightly in a dark turtleneck \u2014 reminds us that fierceness has always been more palatable from some women than from others.", "What good is anger,", " anyway? The philosopher Martha Nussbaum invokes Aristotle\u2019s definition of anger as \u201ca response to a significant damage\u201d that \u201ccontains within itself a hope for payback\u201d to argue that anger is not only \u201ca stupid way to run one\u2019s life\u201d but also a corrosive public force, predicated on the false belief that payback can redress the wrongdoing that inspired it. She points out that women have often embraced the right to their own anger as a \u201cvindication of equality,\u201d part of a larger project of empowerment, but that its promise as a barometer of equality shouldn\u2019t obscure our vision of its dangers. In this current moment of ascendant female anger, are we taking too much for granted about its value? What if we could make space for both anger and a reckoning with its price?", "In her seminal 1981 essay, \u201cThe Uses of Anger,\u201d Audre Lorde weighs the value of anger differently than Nussbaum: not in terms of retribution, but in terms of connection and survival. It\u2019s not just a byproduct of systemic evils, she argues, but a catalyst for useful discomfort and clearer dialogue. \u201cI have suckled the wolf\u2019s lip of anger,\u201d she writes, \u201cand I have used it for illumination, laughter, protection, fire in places where there was no light, no food, no sisters, no quarter.\u201d Anger isn\u2019t just a blaze burning structures to the ground; it also casts a glow, generates heat and brings bodies into communion. \u201cEvery woman has a well-stocked arsenal of anger potentially useful against those oppressions,\u201d Lorde writes, \u201cwhich brought that anger into being.\u201d", "Confronting my own aversion to anger asked me to shift from seeing it simply as an emotion to be felt, and toward understanding it as a tool to be used: part of a well-stocked arsenal. When I walked in the Women\u2019s March in Washington a year ago \u2014 one body among thousands \u2014 the act of marching didn\u2019t just mean claiming the right to a voice; it meant publicly declaring my resolve to use it. I\u2019ve come to think of anger in similar terms: not as a claiming of victimhood but as an owning of accountability. As I write this essay eight months pregnant, I don\u2019t hope that my daughter never gets angry. I hope that she lives in a world that can recognize the ways anger and sadness live together, and the ways rage and responsibility, so often seen as natural enemies, can live together as well.", "\u201cOnce upon a time/I had enough anger in me to crack crystal,\u201d the poet Kiki Petrosino writes in her 2011 poem \u201cAt the Teahouse.\u201d \u201cI boiled up from bed/in my enormous nightdress, with my lungs full of burning/chrysanthemums.\u201d This is a vision of anger as fuel and fire, as a powerful inoculation against passivity, as strange but holy milk suckled from the wolf. This anger is more like an itch than a wound. It demands that something ", "happen", ". It\u2019s my own rage at that faculty meeting, when the voices of students who had become statistics at our fingertips were being asked to hush up, to step back into their tidy columns. This anger isn\u2019t about deserving. It\u2019s about necessity: what needs to boil us out of bed and billow our dresses, what needs to burn in our voices, glowing and fearsome, fully aware of its own heat."]},
