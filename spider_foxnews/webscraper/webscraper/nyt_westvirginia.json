O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200.

The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)", "'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)", "'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from \"The Producers,\" and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)", "'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prizewinner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45).

This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30).

(Brantley)", "'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)", "'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)", "* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)", "'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50).

Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30).

Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed.

This visually rhapsodic film is both profound and profoundly enigmatic. (Holden)", "* 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old, seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy.

Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)", "'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)", "* 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)", "* 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie.

(Scott)", "'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of \"La Boh\u00e8me\" to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)", "'THE RINGER' (PG-13, 94 minutes) A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers. Johnny Knoxville stars, dimly, as a cash-strapped office clerk who tries to rig the Special Olympics. (Nathan Lee)", "'RUMOR HAS IT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Jennifer Aniston, trying her best, traipses through this pointless updating of \"The Graduate,\" in which we learn that Ann Bancroft was really Shirley MacLaine all along, and that Dustin Hoffman grew up to be Kevin Costner. Actually, that makes the movie sound much more interesting than it is.

The cast looks strong, with the ardent tenor Ram\u00f3n Vargas and the splendid soprano Ruth Ann Swenson in the leading roles. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)", "'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Most stagings of Strauss's ever popular operetta, including some revivals of the Met's 1986 Otto Schenk production, seem uncomfortable with the mix of silliness and cynicism in the story of playful infidelities in 1870's Vienna. But the Met's current presentation boasts a winning cast of singers who, for the most part, take the story seriously and give subtle portrayals, especially Bo Skovhus as the ladies' man Gabriel von Eisenstein, Sondra Radvanovsky as his knowing wife, Marlis Petersen as the perky chambermaid Adele and Earle Patriarco as the wily Dr. Falke. Jacques Lacombe conducts a lithe and bracing performance. And with the masterly comedic actor Bill Irwin as the drunken jailer Frosch, the show has plenty of hilarity. Those attending the New Year's Eve gala performance can count on surprise guests showing up to sing during the party scene in Act II. (There will be several cast changes for Wednesday's performance.)

Such is the case for the final two performances this season of Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor,\" starting tonight. There will be a new Lucia, the established Korean soprano Youngok Shin. The young Italian tenor Giuseppe Filianoti, who made an impressive Met debut earlier in the run as Lucia's beloved Edgardo, returns to the cast to sing the role tonight. But Ram\u00f3n Vargas, a veteran bel canto tenor, takes over on Thursday. Edoardo M\u00fcller, who has been conducting the revolving-door \"Lucia\" casts all along, provides some consistency on the podium. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205.

But James Levine is a masterly interpreter of this musically stunning and dramatically compelling work, which he keeps bringing back to the Met in a noble effort to make \"Wozzeck\" essential to the company's repertory. With Mark Lamos's arrestingly abstract 1997 production and an inspired cast headed by Alan Held in the title role, this revival should be seen by all serious opera fans. Mr. Levine elicits a searingly beautiful performance from the great Met orchestra. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220.

A member of the mid-20th-century European Informal art movement based on mentally improvised rather than formal motifs, this Spanish artist is concerned with the body but not in its traditional manifestations. His abstractions and semiabstractions give it a morphing, metaphysical presence; sometimes they involve the depiction of actual body parts, but they rely more on textures, colors and vague forms to evoke the body's ever-shifting sense of itself. But for all the blustery vigor on display, the work gives the viewer a powerful sense of been-there-seen-that. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719.

In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde.

There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details.

For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry.

Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)", "Nobuyoshi Araki, 'Painting Flower and Diaries' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)", "Miki Carmi: 'Psychic Readymades' This young Israeli-born painter makes strangely creepy pictures of oversize bald heads based on those of elderly members of his family. He lavishes painterly attention on veins, age spots, baggy eyes, wrinkles and drooping lips, and he floats the heads like weird balloons against white backgrounds. The paintings are far from beautiful, but their unsettling impact feels right for the often confusing roles that elders play in our psychic lives. Stux, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-1600, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)", "* ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith)", "RYAN DOOLAN: 'RATIONAL GAYZ'  This appealingly arcane debut by a Scottish artist includes small, vaguely photo-based paintings and a photo-performance work involving golf that look great in this austere but cozy new gallery. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, at 29th Street, (212) 481-0362, through Jan. 11. (Smith)", "Matthew McCaslin This inventive sculptor plays with the tension between nature and technology. A working fountain has water flowing from sunflowers made of wide showerheads and copper pipe planted in a claw-foot bathtub. And the arrangement of a cuckoo clock and a flat-screen video view of peaceful lake waters on a natural plywood wall slyly enhances the faux-rustic ambience. Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)", "GORDON MOORE Elegantly understated paintings animated by ghostly linear figures and their shadows, which gambol before the large-paned grid of -- well, maybe a factory window. Composed of lines of different lengths and colors and various thicknesses, these antic figures seem to vibrate on and under the paintings' lightly brushed surfaces. Mr. Moore rings many intricate variations on his basic format, which, while it commits to the visible, manages to engage the mystery of what lies beyond it. Betty Cuningham Gallery, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 242-2772, through Jan. 28. (Glueck)", "Annysa Ng: 'Love & Fear' A beautiful new gallery occupying two floors of a tiny brick house presents works of postmodernist faux-antiquity by a Chinese artist who has studied in Hong Kong, New York and Germany. The large, Victorian-style silhouettes are not without possibilities, though perhaps they are too Kara Walker-like; the hanging assemblages made of braided hair, fabric and found objects have an erotically stirring poetic delicacy. Holasek Weir, 502 West 27th Street, (212) 367-9093, through Jan. 20. (Johnson)", "Nicholas Nixon: 'Life and Times' Among other photographs from the last 30 years, this show features Mr. Nixon's famous \"Brown Sisters,\" a set of group portraits of four sisters made annually, starting in 1975. It is almost painfully touching to see the beautiful siblings evolve from teenagers to late middle age. And then you begin to wonder how long this can go on before one of the five participants will no longer be available. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)", "* LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through Jan. 21. (Smith)", "PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson)", "Felix Schramm: 'Comber' It looks as if a tornado ripped parts off an ordinary house and slammed them into the gallery, creating a Cubist-Expressionist-style environment that was, in fact, carefully designed and assembled by this young and innovative German sculptor. Grimm/Rosenfeld, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-2388, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)", "Catherine Sullivan: 'The Chittendens' In a multiprojection video work, professional actors, none speaking, perform scripted sequences of actions. At first the effect is comical, but humor is overridden by an academic mission to deconstruct codes of behavior in film, theater and real life. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)", "Galleries: SoHo and TriBeCa", "* JIM DRAIN and ARA PETERSON: 'HYPNOGOOGIA' With a kaleidoscopic, mirrored DVD installation and multifaceted sculptures that resemble gaudy, 12-foot-high soccer balls, two of contemporary art's most interesting collaborators have masterminded a kind of wonderland of digital and analog psychedelia. The best piece is best experienced by descending on a ladder into a kind of rabbit hole. The total effect is amazing, if a little vacant. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, through Jan. 28. (Smith)", "'The Last Generation' More or less obscurely, this group show addresses how digital forms of communication and representation are altering human experience. Best are Kota Ezawa's black-and-white animation of a scene from \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"; Jan Mancuska's text and video sculpture; motorized military hats doing synchronized movements, by Malachi Farrell; and Laurent Montaron's combination of a digital photograph of someone sleeping and an audio system that plays on headphones the sounds a sleeper makes. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)", "Last Chance", "* THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS' Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)", "* MET: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT' Hands down the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, s\u00e9ance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. (See above.) Closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)", "* Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS' Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. (See above.) Closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)", "NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: BRIAN JUNGEN Aware that the Nike Air Jordan sneakers worn by the basketball star Michael Jordan are a fetish item for youth throughout the world, Mr. Jungen, a young British Columbian partly of Northwest Coast Indian descent, has cleverly refashioned these trophy sneakers into ceremonial masks that strikingly suggest those produced by Northwest Coast tribes..

But lately, there\u2019s another way that opera has been recognizable to many in its audiences: its dissatisfaction with the state of the world.", "During a recent operagoing trip to Europe, I was struck not by the extent to which productions were placed in the present \u2014 contemporary settings are routine there to an extent they are not in the United States \u2014 but by the degree to which they were critical of the universes they portrayed. They were, above all, savage and skeptical, and therefore felt very much of our moment.", "The most straightforward of the bunch was Simon McBurney\u2019s ", "production of Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rake\u2019s Progress,\u201d", " at the Aix Festival in France. The sins of the young and rich \u2014 the protagonist, Tom Rakewell, enjoys a profligate life and enters into an ill-advised marriage \u2014 have not changed much since the 18th century, when the paintings and etchings on which the opera is based were created. Tom\u2019s adviser, Nick Shadow, is the Devil himself, here a slick capitalist in a black suit who makes his pitch with a slide deck. Stravinsky\u2019s angular, self-consciously antique score added pungent alienation to Mr. McBurney\u2019s pointed references to smartphones, social media and reality television.", "Satirizing the 1 percent might seem like a dicey proposition for the fancy world of European summer music festivals. This isn\u2019t new: G\u00e9rard Mortier\u2019s time at the Salzburg Festival in Austria in the 1990s involved many such bracing provocations. But Aix-en-Provence isn\u2019t Salzburg. Its atmosphere is comparatively down-to-earth \u2014 there\u2019s no red carpet at the opera house \u2014 but also, by design, the programming is more contemplative than star-struck.", "In an interview at the start of the festival, Aix\u2019s outgoing general director, Bernard Foccroulle, described his vision as one in which opera has \u201ca vivid and creative relationship to the past, with a focus that is of our time.\u201d The model should be one of \u201cparticipation, not consumerism,\u201d and he has sought to anchor the festival in larger artistic communities and to make connections with the broader Mediterranean world.", "Mr. Foccroulle\u2019s approach was evident in the other work I saw at Aix, Bizet\u2019s \u201c", "Carmen", ".\u201d It\u2019s opera\u2019s ultimate golden oldie, but Dmitri Tcherniakov\u2019s production, meticulously staged and performed with rare intensity, questions why we keep coming back to this story. The traditional Spanish setting has vanished, in favor of a complex framing narrative in which an alienated modern man in therapy is prescribed the enactment of Bizet\u2019s deadly love story so he can reconnect with his emotions.", "This is the production\u2019s sense of our world: deadened masculinity. It essentially replaces Don Jos\u00e9\u2019s obsession with Carmen (the character) with an obsession with \u201cCarmen\u201d (the opera). Despite its intricacy and novelty, though, it still felt utterly true to the characters\u2019 stories.", "I can\u2019t, however, make the same promise of accessibility when it comes to Krzysztof Warlikowski\u2019s production of Franz Schreker\u2019s 1918 rarity, \u201c", "Die Gezeichneten", ",\u201d which had its premiere at the Bavarian State Opera the previous week. While the libretto sets the work in the Italian Renaissance, this staging plays out, like \u201cRake,\u201d among an immoral contemporary elite, a group of men in a corporate boardroom.", "The plot concerns Alviano Salvago, a disfigured outcast who constructs an island paradise, the pleasures of which go awry when other aristocrats use it as a base for abducting and assaulting the maidens of Genoa. Schreker wrote a cautionary tale of moral decadence, but his effusive post-Romantic musical style makes sin sound really good.", "This production was, above all, a showcase for the Bavarian State Opera\u2019s outstanding, powerful orchestra, led here by Ingo Metzmacher. Singing with conviction and endurance, the cast included John Daszak as Alviano, and Catherine Naglestad as the painter Carlotta.", "Mr. Warlikowski\u2019s production is best when he pushes at the boundaries between art and life, pleasure and immorality. A self-reflexive thread made Alviano into a Schreker stand-in, with the loss of his island paradise standing in for this composer\u2019s condemnation by the Nazis. Sometimes the allusions were too much. (I still can\u2019t figure out what the references to a Kafka story about mice were up to.) But Mr. Warlikowski\u2019s enigmatic, melancholy images of showgirls, boxing rings, silent movies and performance art can be entrancing in their ambiguity, like a puzzle from a strange mind. If you\u2019re into David Lynch, Mr. Warlikowski is the director for you.", "Perhaps the strongest argument for opera in Europe is the variety of approaches. In Zurich, a revival of Andreas Homoki\u2019s production of Wagner\u2019s \u201c", "Lohengrin", "\u201d offered a very different model of what opera can be. Set in a 19th-century Alpine village, it features characters who are pointedly closed off to a wider society. (This, in itself, may be a comment on that \u2014 on our \u2014 world.) The evening plays out in a plain wooden box, and the costumes of lederhosen and dirndls, while picturesque, are hardly the medieval dress of a conventional \u201cLohengrin.\u201d", "The production rejects otherworldly effects: The knight-savior Lohengrin appears in a nightshirt amid a crowd of chorus members and never seems to wield any magical powers. The cast, with Brandon Jovanovich and Rachel Willis-Sorensen in the leading roles, was heartfelt, but, perhaps intentionally, never transcended the production\u2019s intimate scale. The opera became a simple, quietly compelling, all too reverberant tale of a community in crisis.", "Mr. Homoki\u2019s rejection of allegory is unusual for \u201cLohengrin,\u201d an opera whose questions of faith, trust and social cohesion have often lent themselves to fanciful interpretations, like Hans Neuenfels\u2019s mouse-themed ", "production", " for the Bayreuth Festival in Germany. After the rich food for thought in Aix and Munich, I found Mr. Homoki\u2019s approach rather plain, however luminous Fabio Luisi\u2019s conducting was. But it is never boring, and its careful craft and expressivity have their own kind of honesty, particularly in the intimate space of Zurich\u2019s opera house.", "It\u2019s also noteworthy that all these productions featured prominent, and excellent, performances by American singers: As well as Ms. Naglestad, Mr. Jovanovich and Ms. Willis-Sorensen, the list also included Michael Fabiano in \u201cCarmen,\u201d and Paul Appleby and Julia Bullock in \u201cRake\u2019s Progress.\u201d You hope they will bring something from these adventurous and intense operatic experiments back home."]},

It is a steaming, hyper-air-conditioned, boom-bust-boom town that oozes across 500 relentlessly flat, bayou-laced square miles, the most ethnically and racially diverse, most unionized city in all of Texas, with aching disparities between rich and poor matched in few other places in the country.", "It is the city that oil built. Houston was nothing much until the first gusher came in; that was Spindletop, on the Gulf coast, which blasted Houston and Texas and the whole blessed world into the era of petroleum on Jan. 10, 1901. Since then, Houston has been a city of flamboyant oilmen like Glenn McCarthy and Hugh Roy Cullen, a city of big gestures and big spenders and bigger hair, where minimalism is a dirty word and nobody would dream of dressing down.", "It is the city a whole generation remembers for a single radio transmission in 1969, from an astronaut on the moon to the NASA installation southeast of town: ''Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.'' It is the city that gave birth, with Judge Roy Hofheinz's Astrodome, to the startling idea that baseball and football could be played indoors -- and, of course, to that emerald-green apotheosis of artifice, Astroturf.", "It is a city much more Southern than Western, green and not brown, full of magnolias, live oaks and Spanish moss. The cactus and the tumbleweeds are stored farther west (though Houston's rodeo, on now, is the nation's biggest).", "It is a city that has lent major political figures to the nation. People like Jesse H. Jones, who spearheaded the building of the Houston Ship Channel that made Houston a great port, who owned big chunks of the Texas Commerce Bank and The Houston Chronicle, whom Franklin D. Roosevelt summoned to Washington to run the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which he did so arrogantly that F.D.R. called him ''Jesus H. Jones.'' Men like Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and George Bush, the 41st President. Women like Oveta Culp Hobby, the wartime head of the WAC, and the eloquent Barbara Jordan. Lawyers from elite firms like John B. Connally of Vinson & Elkins and James A. Baker 3d of Baker & Botts, who held no fewer than four Cabinet-level positions.", "It is an ugly, sprawling city, unprotected by zoning laws. Block after barren block of weed-infested parking lots and disintegrating houses stand close by upscale shopping centers and lushly landscaped residential Edens like River Oaks. Too many hours are spent in cars on the congested but indispensable freeways. Yet in its way, it is also a city of art and culture, of exciting museums and distinguished buildings and world-class performing arts organizations. When J. B. Priestley, the English writer, visited Houston in the 1950's, somebody told him it was ''strictly a whisky and trombone town.'' That was before the gentling hand of Dominique de Menil took hold.", "Mrs. de Menil, who died last December at 89, used her large fortune, which came from oil-well technology, to advance the cause of the arts in Houston. Her monuments are a series of buildings in the modestly bohemian section of town called Montrose -- the Rothko Chapel, a nondenominational building housing 14 somber canvases by Mark Rothko, with a Barnett Newman sculpture called ''Broken Obelisk'' nearby; the Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum, one block to the south, built to house a series of 13th-century wall paintings from a votive chapel in Cyprus, and the Menil Collection, a private museum on the scale of the Frick Collection in New York and the Wallace Collection in London.", "The Menil Collection is housed in one of the best museum buildings erected since World War II -- a gray clapboard structure, low-built like the neighborhood surrounding it, with noise-absorbing wooden floors and a clever system of S-shaped light baffles. It is the work of Renzo Piano, co-architect of the Pompidou Center in Paris. Mrs. de Menil (pronounced men-EEL) had a famous eye, and the museum's rooms are filled with stunning objects, ranging from a sixth-century Coptic funeral stele depicting a wide-eyed woman, to exquisite Chi-Wara antelope sculptures from Mali in West Africa, to icons from Novgorod and Venice and Turkey, to 20th-century Surrealist paintings. There is not a clunker in sight.", "All seems serene, but Texas is a land of surprises. The museum is currently playing host (along with the Museum of Fine Arts and the Contemporary Arts Museum) to the Robert Rauschenberg retrospective first shown at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. No sooner had it opened, with the 72-year-old artist, a native of nearby Port Arthur, in attendance, than constables swooped in and hauled away 15 works from his personal collection, to satisfy a $5.5 million judgment against him in a lawsuit brought by a disgruntled Austin art dealer. [The paintings have since been returned to the museum.]", "The Contemporary Arts Museum, which has no permanent collection, and the Museum of Fine Arts, which does, are a few blocks away, so the whole show can be seen with relatively little difficulty. The M.F.A., as the locals call it, has a good collection of Impressionist and modern paintings, highlighted by superior pictures by ''secondary'' artists like Caillebotte, an excellent sculpture garden and substantial Old Master holdings. Material from the latter collections forms part of a current show, ''The Body of Christ in the Art of Europe and New Spain.'' Included is one of Zurbaran's most touching paintings, showing the Lamb of God trussed for sacrifice, as well as works by Durer and Giovanni Bellini.", "A third building for the Museum of Fine Arts is now under construction and scheduled for opening in the spring of 2000. The largest museum of its kind in the Southwest, though not in the same league with the Kimbell in Fort Worth, it has made a particular effort to involve the Hispanic community in its programs.", "The impulse to reach out is also evident on once-a-month family days, with free admission, at Bayou Bend, a mini-Winterthur bequeathed to the museum by Ima Hogg, the unfortunately named daughter of Texas's first native-born Governor. Named for the lazy stream that flows through the 14-acre property, Bayou Bend, a pale pink house built in 1927, stands amid gardens adorned with statues and fountains and notable for their azaleas, now approaching full bloom.", "Reached by a pedestrian suspension bridge that crosses the bayou, the house contains 4,800 English and American objects installed in 28 room settings. There is a silver sugar bowl by Paul Revere and a refined lyre-base epergne by an anonymous English craftsman; portraits by Copley and Charles Willson Peale; furniture by Duncan Phyfe and Benjamin H. Latrobe, a corner cupboard filled with delicate creamware and another with rustic Pennsylvania spatterware.", "Miss Hogg, whose brother Will developed River Oaks, was also a founder of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Once overseen by such notables as Leopold Stokowski and Sir John Barbirolli, it has embellished its reputation under Christoph Eschenbach, whose style has been compared to that of Wilhelm Furtwangler, the great German conductor. Mr. Eschenbach's tenure as music director here ends next May, and no successor has been chosen; he himself is mentioned among potential successors to Claudio Abbado when he leaves the Berlin Philharmonic in 2002.", "Houston also has a first-rate resident stage company, the Alley Theater, in business since 1946, which mounts a dozen or so productions a year on two stages; a nationally known ballet company under Ben Stevenson, its artistic director, and the innovative Houston Grand Opera, with which the ballet shares the new Wortham Theater Center at the heart of the revitalized theater district downtown.", "A little too revitalized: the recently opened Bayou Place, a complex of restaurants and performance spaces, has taxed the area's parking resources. There are also problems with crowd circulation at the otherwise splendid Wortham Theater Center, which houses a 2,200-seat auditorium and a 1,100-seat hall.", "In 25 years as the opera company's general director, David Gockley has championed modern opera, staging many world premieres, and brought semi-operatic American musicals like Porgy and Bess and Showboat into the opera house. One of this year's features was the Francesca Zambello production of Benjamin Britten's Billy Budd, which won awards at Covent Garden and at the Opera Bastille in Paris. It starred the hot young Danish baritone Bo Skovhus, making only his second American operatic appearance after singing in San Francisco earlier.", "If I had to choose Houston's premier art form, it would be architecture. Long before Mr. Piano's eloquently understated building for the Menil Collection went up, long before the Astrodome, there were interesting, mostly modern structures in Houston's three main nodes -- downtown, the Galleria area to the west and the Rice University/Texas Medical Center neighborhood to the south.", "The Rice campus, where building began in 1912, is arranged in a series of quadrangles laid out by Ralph Adams Cram (a new master plan has been prepared by Cesar Pelli). Cram used collegiate Gothic at West Point and Princeton, but for Houston's climate, he decided that a generalized Mediterranean style would be appropriate. Rice's new showplace is the Baker Institute for Public Policy, named for George Bush's Secretary of State and headed by Edward P. Djerejian, a former Ambassador to Israel and Syria. With state-of-the-art conference facilities, it aspires to a place alongside similar centers at Harvard and Princeton.", "Just to the south rise the architecturally mediocre buildings of the medical center, one of the finest in the country. It embraces almost 40 hospitals and medical and nursing schools, including the outstanding M. D. Anderson cancer clinic. Two of the nation's most celebrated heart surgeons, Dr. Michael E. DeBakey and Dr. Denton Cooley, perform operations at the center.", "Downtown, where the city was founded in 1836 by its own Romulus and Remus, the brothers Augustus C. and John K. Allen of New York, is a forest of silver and green and terra-cotta-colored skyscrapers leaping from the flatlands. Among the best are the Enron Building, oval in cross-section, wrapped in a sleek membrane of white aluminum and silvered glass, with a neon ''halo'' around the top at night; the beautifully proportioned Tenneco building, now known as the El Paso Energy Building, by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and the massive 71-story Wells Fargo Plaza, composed of two quarter-round towers, clad in dark green glass and offset from one another by 15 feet.", "But Houston is Philip Johnson country, home to some of his most acclaimed buildings. Pennzoil Place, at 711 Louisiana Street, is the most spectacular of Mr. Johnson's downtown designs, a pair of wedge-shaped towers, their tops lopped off at a 45-degree angle, joined at the base by a glassed-in pedestrian gallery filled with trees, flowers and sunlight. Less successful, if no less distinctive, is the Republic Bank Center at 700 Louisiana Street, built of Swedish red granite. Drawing upon and vastly magnifying the distinctive stepped gables of 16th-century Dutch churches and houses, it jabs an astonishing silhouette into the Texas sky.", "At the feet of these and other buildings is a delightful array of public sculpture by Oldenburg, Calder, Richard Lippold, Henry Moore, Dubuffet, Nevelson (''Frozen Laces,'' 1979) and Miro. The Miro, entitled ''Personage and Birds'' and completed in 1970, is an angular, Tinkertoy-like construction in primary colors that sits below I. M. Pei's Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Bank Building), a granite tower, cut at the corners, at 600 Travis Street.", "Mr. Johnson also designed a quadrangle at University of St. Thomas, not far from the Menil Collection, where he married Jefferson's plan at the University of Virginia to a Miesian esthetic. Right at the top of the main axis, where the rotunda stands in Charlottesville, Mr. Johnson recently completed a geometric tour de force, St. Basil's Chapel, composed of a white cube cut by a black plane and topped with a gold dome.", "Farther west, near the Galleria shopping mall, is yet another must-see Johnson project, designed with John Burgee: the Transco Tower, of which he wrote, ''This will always seem like the tallest building in the world.'' Though only 65 stories, it seems taller because it stands not with other skyscrapers but above low-rise retail buildings; it is, in fact,  the tallest building anywhere outside a city center.", "With its distinctive setbacks, it is reminiscent of the Empire State Building (and of some designs in the famous 1922 Tribune Tower competition in Chicago), executed not in stone but in faceted mirror glass. A revolving beacon on top adds to the Art Deco image.", "From the Alley Theater to Anthony's, From the Rothko Chapel to Pennzoil Place: Where to Cool the Heels and Drench the Senses", "Here is information about Houston:", "Where to Stay", "THE LANCASTER HOTEL, 701 Texas Avenue, in the heart of the downtown theater (and concert and opera) district, was restored to its original 1920's elegance a few years ago; with a cheery, canary-yellow lobby and gleaming antiques in many of its 93 bedrooms, this is one of Houston's gems. Actors and singers love the food in its Bistro and from its 24-hour room service. An unusually friendly staff provides solicitous service.  Rates: For double occupancy, daily weekday rates range from $255 to $300; Friday and Saturday rates range from $145 to $155. (713) 228-9500.", "THE FOUR SEASONS, 1300 Lamar Street, also downtown, is not one of the Canadian-owned chain's superstars, like its sisters in Chicago and Boston. But it's still a first-rate business and leisure hotel, with thick carpets downstairs and memorably comfortable beds upstairs. The hotel's employees try hard, but they seem overstressed on holiday weekends and during conventions. Ten of its 30 floors are devoted to apartments, mostly owned by well-off locals. Rates: For double occupancy, daily weekday rates range from $290 to $355; Friday and Saturday rates range from $145 to $205.

But in fact, the best of Houston's hotels, having lost the right to use the Ritz-Carlton name, answers the phone, ''Luxury Collection,'' a clumsy moniker at best.

Shy, serious and bursting with talent, Robert del Grande, the chef, cooks bold food with roots in both the Mexican and European traditions: coffee-roasted beef, on one hand, and a perfectly seared scallop paired with foie gras on the other.

Not so at Anthony's, his ambitious but relaxed second restaurant. The Pompeian red decor is a bit gaudy, but this is Texas, and we were dazzled by a lunch that included duck pillows with ponzu and pear essence; a small, chewy lobster and crabmeat souffle, and a flawless piece of grilled superfresh red snapper.

The best comes near the end, when Ms. McDonald, as a singer in 2002 reaching for a comeback in a cheesy music video, puts Auto-Tune to shame. A later segment takes place in 1989, in which Ms. Plimpton plays a Washington senator keeping her lover (Ms. McDonald) a secret.

That sets them apart from the New York Yankees of the 1950s, the Boston Celtics of the 1960s and the Chicago Bulls of the 1990s.", "The victories have not always been pretty, including the one on Sunday, when Brady had to engineer his record eighth fourth-quarter playoff comeback. For long parts of the game, the Jaguars appeared poised to pull off one of the bigger upsets in playoff history. The Patriots fell behind by 14-3 in the second quarter and played from behind for much of the game, struggling to establish their running game. They also lost their top receiver, tight end Rob Gronkowski, to a head injury in the second quarter.", "But Brady, who has also appeared in more playoff games than any other quarterback, once again led the Patriots with ruthless efficiency when it mattered most. Facing a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter, he engineered two scoring drives \u2014 aided by several Jaguars penalties \u2014 and put the Patriots ahead for good with less than three minutes remaining, when he hit wide receiver Danny Amendola with a 4-yard touchdown pass.", "\u201cIf you look up \u2018good football player\u2019 in the dictionary, his picture is right beside it,\u201d Coach Bill Belichick said of Amendola.", "As they have done for years, Brady and Belichick did not buckle under pressure when trailing late. The Patriots\u2019 defense provided the necessary support, stifling the Jaguars, blocking passes and rushing Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles in the second half.", "That left Brady, 40 years old and showing few signs of slowing down, with plenty of time on the clock. Showered several times by chants of \u201cBrady, Brady\u201d from the Gillette Stadium crowd, he completed 26 of 38 passes for 290 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.", "\u201cWhen things start to crack a little bit, some teams haven\u2019t had the same experience,\u201d Patriots owner Robert K.

After Kraft learned of the injury, he raced home from Florida.", "The Patriots were tight-lipped as usual. Brady did not speak to the news media on Wednesday or Thursday, and he did not practice those days. When he returned on Friday, Brady wore a glove and said only \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d when asked if he was confident that he would start on Sunday.", "\u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of crazy injuries, but this was pretty crazy,\u201d Brady said after the game. \u201cThey come up and you just deal with them, and I wasn\u2019t quite sure how I was going to do.\u201d", "When he emerged for warm-ups on Sunday, it brought cheers from the early contingent of fans. He ran down the sideline wearing a white glove on his left hand and with black tape covering part of his right one. He then fist-bumped his coach, using the troublesome right hand, and started throwing passes to ball boys and receivers.", "\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about open heart surgery here,\u201d Belichick said with typical sarcasm after the game.", "Brady extinguished uncertainty on the opening drive, completing all six of his passes to four receivers.", "Perhaps in a concession to his injury, Brady often worked out of the shotgun and with an empty backfield \u2014 giving him more time and more receivers to target. Still, the Jaguars\u2019 pass rushers were able to get to Brady, chasing him out of bounds and sacking him near the line of scrimmage. In what amounted to a minor victory for a visiting team at Gillette Stadium, the Jaguars held the Patriots to a field goal on that first drive.", "With Brady\u2019s thumb no longer a mystery, the question was what Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles would do with his healthy throwing hand. The Jaguars kept things simple, handing the ball to the rookie running back Leonard Fournette, who had 76 yards rushing, and throwing short passes. Bortles (23 of 36 for 293 yards) drove the Jaguars down the field and hit tight end Marcedes Lewis for a 4-yard touchdown.", "The Jaguars pushed the lead to 14-3 after Fournette scored on a 4-yard run. They had a chance to pad their lead, but three penalties, including one that was declined, forced the them to punt with a little more than two minutes left in the first half.", "Brady made Jacksonville pay for those mistakes. For nearly two decades, fans here have watched him dissect opposing defenses. Before halftime, Brady hit Brandin Cooks, Amendola and running back James White.

Their portrayal of a Chicago couple who have made the best of a 38-year marriage despite the lie at its center is both plausible and moving.", "Marilyn, a feisty former dancer, has become an entrepreneur who sells her fragrances and cosmetics on the Home Shopping Network. \u201cPerfume is about our bodies talking to each other without words,\u201d she tells viewers.", "Lee is a commercial real estate developer, a Catholic who keeps a religious altar in his home where he prays for God\u2019s forgiveness for his sexual attraction to men, and says he has done his best to resist temptation.", "It\u2019s all slightly campy, but these two, whose relationship could easily have been portrayed in a mawkish or ridiculous way, came across to me as deeply sympathetic. God only knows how many marriages between ambitious women and closeted gay men were created (and endured, even now) during the decades-long rights revolution in the United States that culminated with the full striking down of sodomy laws, in 2003, and the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage, in 2015. How did these couples manage these lies, while striving to lead lives of decency and integrity?", "Like the series over all, this week\u2019s episode is not told in chronological order. It is 1997. We follow Marilyn from a work trip in Toronto back to her home on Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast, where she quickly notices that things are not as they should be. Two passing friends dial the police. Marilyn sits in the kitchen, her polished nails dancing on the granite countertop, as a bloodcurdling scream is heard from the garage: Lee\u2019s mutilated body has been found.", "\u201cI knew it,\u201d Marilyn says under her breath.", "Flash backward, a week earlier: Marilyn and Lee are at a fund-raising luncheon for Gov. Jim Edgar, Republican of Illinois.", "She introduces her husband in terms so admiring as to be gushing: \u201cSo often we are told the American dream is dead. Except I say: Look at my husband, Lee. One of seven children. The son of an Illinois coal miner. He began his career selling premixed pancake batter out of the trunk of a beat-up old car. And today Lee manages 32 million square feet of commercial property across the Midwest.\u201d", "Later, at home, Marilyn moisturizes her face and removes her cosmetic eyelashes. It would have been easy for the episode\u2019s writer (Tom Rob Smith) and director (Gwyneth Horder-Payton) to have this moment be the one when the mask of a happy marriage is removed, its ugly face revealed.", "In some ways that happens: In a quiet moment before the mirror, Marilyn applies a drop of perfume down the front of her silk robe, her eyes hollowed out with longing. In another room, Lee takes a call from Andrew Cunanan, dialing from a pay phone, and when Marilyn asks who is calling, he lies and says it\u2019s a business call. But the marriage is not merely a sham. When Marilyn asks Lee what he plans to do while she is away on business, he sounds down. She asks him to accompany her.", "\u201cI like it when you\u2019re there,\u201d she says, and she means it.", "It is their last meaningful encounter.", "With Marilyn away, Lee opens his door to the serial killer, who happens to be in town. Lee shows him his plans to build a 125-story, 1,952-foot ", "Sky Needle", ", which would have been the world\u2019s tallest building.", "The conversation does not go well. Andrew thinks the main point of having a building taller than the Sears Tower (now ", "Willis Tower", ") is to surpass the latter structure\u2019s observation deck. Andrew also urges Lee to name the tower for himself, something the self-effacing developer has no intention of doing.", "They kiss \u2014 \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m alive,\u201d Lee says \u2014 and Andrew boasts: \u201cEscorts don\u2019t normally kiss, do they? I am not like most escorts. I am not like most anybody. I could almost be a husband, a partner.\u201d", "I found this reference to marriage anachronistic, and puzzling, and not for the first time in this series. In earlier episodes, Gianni Versace\u2019s partner, Antonio D\u2019Amico, tired of their hedonistic lifestyle, proposes, and Cunanan tells a friend \u2014 falsely, we believe \u2014 that Versace once proposed to him.", "I\u2019m certainly not making light of commitment or the desire for it. But I\u2019m puzzled by the use of words like \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cproposed.\u201d They don\u2019t seem true to my own memories of the late 1990s, when gay men were more likely to speak of boyfriends, partners and companions, and they seem strangely ahistoric.", "My next quibble with this episode is more prosaic: the killing of Lee Miglin, in his garage, by Cunanan is so grisly and sadistic as to be difficult to watch. I\u2019ll spare the details, but the monologue Cunanan delivers before delivering the coup de gr\u00e2ce bears note:", "The monologue raises the question: Is Cunanan motivated by self-hatred, a desire to expose hypocrisy, or both? His use of homophobic language suggests self-hatred, but his focus on disgrace suggests some kind of crusade. It is not, of course, a crime to cross-dress, or to look at porn. This mutual failure of recognition \u2014 murderer and victim seem to agree on one thing, that to be gay is a disgrace \u2014 is perhaps the saddest moment in this series so far.", "The rest of the episode is a tour de force by Judith Light, whose portrayal of a wife in denial is simply magnificent. She offers a brisk inventory of what\u2019s missing from the house \u2014 a Lexus, $2,000 in cash, two leather coats, two suits, \u201csome inconsequential pieces of jewelry,\u201d rare gold coins and a dozen pairs of socks \u2014 as she reaches the conclusion that the killing must have been a random and opportunistic robbery.", "Told by the Chicago police superintendent about the gay porn found next to the body, Marilyn surmises that \u201cthey must have belonged to the killer,\u201d but goes on to say: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in his intentions. Find him, catch him, but don\u2019t talk to me about what or might not be going through his mind.\u201d", "She adds: \u201cDollars, jewelry, socks, suits \u2014 that\u2019s all I\u2019ll allow that man to steal from me. He won\u2019t steal my good name. Our good name. We worked too hard making that name, and we made it together.\u201d", "For an ambitious woman born in the 1930s to have a husband who is fully supportive of her professional aspirations might indeed, as she suggests, have been \u201ca fairy tale life.\u201d \u201cHow many husbands believe in their wives\u2019 dreams?\u201d she asks her Home Shopping Network viewers \u2014 and us \u2014 later in the episode. \u201cHow many treat us as partners, as equals?\u201d", "Left unsaid: Perhaps his being gay allowed him to be such a supportive partner.", "Compared with all this, Cunanan\u2019s murderous escapades seem mundane. He flees to New Jersey, and the police failure to capture him after a radio station reveals that investigators have been tracking his movements by car phone. In search of a new car to steal, he stops at a cemetery, where he marches one of the groundskeepers into a basement and makes him get down on his knees.", "The man begs for mercy, but his plea is cut short. And for the first time in this series I was so disgusted by this killer\u2019s lack of remorse that \u2014 for a moment at least \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to keep watching.", "At least most of carnage is out of the way. Six more episodes, two more bodies to go."]},

We have to tell it like it is.\"", "As he has done before, Trump conjured images of violence and suffering when he described the perils of illegal immigration, though statistics show that immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than citizens. He dubbed MS-13 gang members \"thugs\" and said his administration's crackdown on the group was \"like a war.\"", "\"MS-13 is emblematic of evil, and we're getting them out by the hundreds,\" said Trump, who sat on stage at a long table in a gym draped in American flags and decorated with signs that read \"USA open for business.\" ''This is the kind of stuff and crap we are allowing in our country, and we can't do it anymore.\"", "Invoking the lines of his June 2015 campaign kickoff speech, in which he suggested that some Mexican immigrants were rapists, the president mused about the threat of violence among immigrants and appeared to make reference to a caravan of migrants that had been working its way north through Mexico toward the United States.", "\"Remember my opening remarks at Trump Tower when I opened? Everybody said, 'Oh, he was so tough,' and I used the word rape,\" he said. \"And yesterday it came out where this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before. They don't want to mention that.\"", "It was not clear what Trump was referring to. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Trump wasn't talking about the caravan but rather about extreme victimization of those making the journey north with smugglers in general. And press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later said that she was \"not sure why the media is acting like this isn't a well-established fact \u2014 women and young girls are brutally victimized on the journey north.\"", "Trump also defended his proposed tariff plan, which many of his fellow Republicans fear will start a trade war with China. He criticized West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who has expressed openness to working with the White House, for opposing the GOP tax plan. He praised attendees Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, both running in the Republican primary for Senate next month, suggesting an applause test between the two. And, of course, he reminisced about his 2016 electoral victory in the Mountain State.", "All of that overshadowed any time spent promoting the tax plan.", "It underscored the frustration of many congressional Republicans with the president's frequent indiscipline. Many members of his own party have blamed the president's lack of focus for helping to stymie their agenda, and they are eager for him to focus on the tax cut, the most significant legislation achievement on which to run in the upcoming midterm elections.", "While Trump went off script, the attendees \u2014an assemblage of state politicians, local business owners, workers and families \u2014 stayed dutifully on task, talking about how the tax cuts have helped them.", "One woman, Jessica Hodge, tearfully told Trump: \"I just want to say thank you for the tax cuts. This is a big deal for our family.\" Jenkins said that \"West Virginians understand your policies are working\" and that Trump was \"welcome to come back any time.\"", "___", "Lemire reported from New York.", "___", "Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Lucey at http://twitter.com/@catherine_lucey"]},

But the president grew tired of his prepared remarks after a few moments and returned to the bitter complaints about the United States\u2019 immigration laws that have dominated his attention this week and prompted him on Wednesday to ask governors to deploy the National Guard to the southern border.", "\u201cThis was going to be my remarks \u2014 it would have taken about two minutes, but what the hell \u2014 that would have been a little boring,\u201d Mr. Trump said, tossing a sheet of paper covered with neat paragraphs of text into the audience. \u201cI\u2019m reading off the first paragraph, I said, \u2018This is boring.\u2019 Come on. We have to tell it like it is.\u201d", "Instead, he recounted the ", "terrorist attack ", "last October", " in Lower Manhattan, in which an Uzbek immigrant killed eight people when he drove a truck onto a pedestrian and bicycle path on the West Side Highway.", "\u201cThis is what the Democrats are doing to you, and they like it because they think they\u2019re going to vote Democrat,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it for that reason, and other reasons.\u201d", "The president later told reporters aboard Air Force One that he intended to deploy 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard troops to the border with Mexico. If Mr. Trump sends the low end of his proposal, it would barely exceed the 1,200 sent by President Barack Obama in 2010 to support other border agencies. Even if Mr. Trump sends 4,000, the top end of his proposal, he would be dispatching fewer than President George W. Bush did in 2006.", "In a statement on Thursday, the Pentagon press secretary, Dana White, said that the National Guard troops would focus on engineering, logistical support and vehicle maintenance among other things. The statement did not mention the troops taking part in law enforcement.", "Republican leaders have urged the president to sell the tax cut that he signed in December, and have tried to make economic growth and low taxes the central theme of 2018 as they move toward a difficult midterm election season. But Mr. Trump has refused to keep to the script.", "Instead on Thursday, he opted to blast immigrants and the country\u2019s immigration laws, including a practice known as \u201ccatch and release,\u201d in which migrants who present themselves at the border are released from custody to await an immigration hearing to determine whether they should be allowed to remain in the United States.", "\u201cWe\u2019re toughening up at the border,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe cannot let people enter our country \u2014 we have no idea who they are, what they do, where they came from.\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019re murderers, if they\u2019re killers, if they\u2019re MS-13,\u201d Mr. Trump went on. \u201cWe\u2019re throwing them out by the hundreds.\u201d", "He boasted that he had ", "described immigrants as rapists when he announced his presidential candidacy", ", saying that he had recently learned that during the journey north made by a caravan of Honduran migrants, \u201cwomen are raped at levels they\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d", "Mr. Trump also said his administration had cracked down on MS-13, the transnational gang with links to El Salvador, detailing its brutal methods.", "\u201cThis is the kind of stuff and crap that we\u2019re allowing into our country, and we can\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Trump said.", "He also repeated his false claim that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election.", "\u201cThey always like to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a conspiracy theory,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNot a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people.\u201d", "Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks drew enthusiastic applause from an audience of about 200 in a state that he won with 68 percent of the vote, his largest margin of victory in the country.", "But it also drew rebukes.", "\u201cPresident Trump is insulting American voters by making up lies,\u201d said Jason Kander, a former Democratic candidate for the Senate and now the president of Let America Vote, a voting rights group. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s lies cause the American electorate to lose faith in our system of elections and take our elections less seriously, which is one of his goals. If people don\u2019t trust that their vote counts, then they won\u2019t vote.\u201d", "The round table on taxes was a lovefest for the president, in which attendees took turns praising him and recounting the ways in which the tax measure and Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda had helped them and their families.", "\u201cThis is a big deal for our family,\u201d Jessica Hodge said, choking back tears after her husband told Mr. Trump that their family had saved $2,417 because of the tax cut. He said they planned to spend it on a kitchen renovation.", "\u201cThank you for listening to us. Thank you for fighting for us,\u201d she added.", "The president grinned and nodded his approval.", "Evan Jenkins, a West Virginia House member, and Patrick Morrisey, the state\u2019s attorney general \u2014 who are competing in a May primary to run for the Senate \u2014 flanked Mr. Trump and took turns showering him with praise.", "\u201cYou\u2019re a man keeping your promises,\u201d Mr. Jenkins said. \u201cThanks for keeping your promise.\u201d", "Mr. Morrisey chimed in. \u201cYour policies really have made an incredible difference in our state,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe had the bull\u2019s-eye on us until you got here, so thank you for that.\u201d", "As he wrapped up the event, Mr. Trump asked the audience to weigh in on which man should win the primary next month.", "\u201cShould we do a little test?\u201d he said. \u201cWho\u2019s voting for Patrick? Who\u2019s voting for Evan?\u201d", "The applause was loudest for Mr. Jenkins, who represents the district that White Sulphur Springs is in.", "Mr. Trump also attacked Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, saying that he had opposed tough immigration laws and the rest of the president\u2019s agenda.", "\u201cI thought he would be helpful because he talks,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Manchin, a centrist who is known for seeking compromises with Republicans. \u201cBut he votes against everything, and he voted against our tax cuts.\u201d", "While Mr. Trump spent little time promoting the tax measure he had come to celebrate, he seemed to feed off the adulation of his crowd and relish his detour off-script. Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington, the president asked how the event had gone.", "Greeted with silence, Mr. Trump answered his own question, saying he was \u201cvery happy.\u201d", "\u201cThought it was really great,\u201d he added."]},
