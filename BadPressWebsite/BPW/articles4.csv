2017-04-27	https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/politics/joe-manchin-trump-hundred-days/index.html	Manchin charts own path in Trump-era West Virginia 	5	1	1	" Huntington, West Virginia (CNN) It was as if a light bulb went off over Sen. Joe Manchin's head. Manchin was touring a job fair hosted by his office last week and had just met the director of West Virginia's affiliate for Dress for Success, an organization that helps provide professional clothes for women. ""He's on 'Say Yes to the Dress,'"" Manchin repeated, still searching for the last name of the celebrity bridal consultant from the TLC reality show. It was the 17th job fair Manchin's office had hosted, this time in Huntington, West Virginia, a city with nearly 50,000 people on the western edge of the state. Manchin was already a well-known figure in West Virginia and on the national stage, but he has seen renewed attention under the first 100 days of President Donald Trump's administration. Though the senator -- who's had a long career in public service -- has high name recognition in the state and a brand as a centrist Democrat, he's still campaigning among an electorate that picked Trump over Hillary Clinton by a whopping 42 points. In fact,  Democrats in West Virginia outnumbered Republicans in last year's election -- 44% to 31%  -- but the state still yielded Trump one of his greatest victory margins over Clinton. ""If I was a constituent and I looked at me and I said 'Joe Manchin, he's changed to a Republican or changed to an independent. Aiming to be the 'honest broker' Instead, Manchin is building a case that he's a Democrat with Trump's ear and can be what he calls an ""honest broker"" between the White House and his own party. Manchin's relationship with the President -- as well as the senator's efforts to cozy up to conservative media outlets like Breitbart -- have generated buzz this year, and last week Manchin sounded open to a potential endorsement from Trump, though he said he hasn't spoken with the president about it. And while he said he's ""happy"" with Manchin as his senator and plans to vote for him next year, he said at the end of the day he's ""not sure"" he can trust him. Jarrett Peters, 78, said he's not registered with any party and voted for Trump last year. Marilyn Meade, a 63-year-old Democrat who also stressed that she votes ""for the person,"" preferred Bernie Sanders over Clinton in the primary, but said she likes Manchin's moderate spirit and stated that she'll be voting for him next year. It's that same congressman who's considering a challenge against Manchin next year, as is state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Also likely to come up is Manchin's 2013 proposal with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey to expand background checks on gun purchases, a position that drew sharp rebuke from gun rights activists, including the National Rifle Association. Also anticipated from his opposition are attacks involving his daughter, Heather Bresch,  over criticism that her company, Mylan, raised prices for the life-saving medicine EpiPen by nearly 500% last year in order to enrich her company And Republicans are sure to reiterate Manchin's loyalty to Clinton last year, even after she made the damaging comment in a CNN town hall that she was ""going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."" The only Democrat who had a higher ranking was Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who's also up for re-election next year in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump."	56	5
2014-05-16	https://www.cnn.com/2014/05/16/us/west-virginia-school-controversy/index.html	W. Virginia AG: Middle school concealed alleged sex assaults, protected suspects	5	1	1	" The case moved behind closed doors Friday at the Mingo County courthouse, where two school district officials and four faculty members made their first appearance in a courtroom for a hearing a week after the state's top lawyer accused them in a civil complaint of concealing alleged sexual abuse at a Mingo County middle school. Names of neither the boys nor the girls have been released, but the attorney general's court filing identifies the suspects as Juvenile 1 and Juvenile 2, and states they are both relatives of employees of the Mingo County school system. Attorney General Morrisey declined to be interviewed for this article, but West Virginia State Police Public Information Officer Lt. Mike Baylous explained that a civil injunction -- like the one requested by Morrisey in this case -- is an ""extreme"" court order that is made for the purpose of restraining the defendant -- or in this case, the defendants - from pursuing any conduct that amounts to harassment. Court filings cite repeated examples of school officials allegedly protecting the accused in the seventh-grade sexual assault allegations, and claim that ""a relative of (one of the boys) was directly involved in the handling and investigation into the allegations against (him), and involved in decisions relating to the discipline/punishment of the male juvenile offenders."" In one instance, for example, a school official ""'disciplined' (the boys) for the alleged abuse of a female student by denying them a break for ice cream during statewide testing,"" the attorney general's court filing said. Jason Long, the attorney representing the Mingo County Board of Education and the Mingo County school superintendent, released a statement that said ""the Mingo County Board of Education is committed to working with the attorney general's office to resolve this investigation in a timely manner."	19	7

Residents of nine counties -- including the one that is home to Charleston, West Virginia's capital and most populated city -- were urged last week not to use their tap water to do anything except flush their toilets. The Greater Cincinnati Water Works, which serves that Ohio city and parts of four counties in Ohio and Kentucky, will temporarily stop taking water from the Ohio River as a precaution, allowing water that might contain traces of the chemical to pass the city, company spokeswoman Michele Ralston said Tuesday."	23	5

Joe Manchin is heading into his re-election fight as a top target for Republicans, but to hear him tell it, he does not care about the pressure on his seat. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican challenging Manchin in the 2018 Senate race, issued a letter last week calling on Manchin to resign his position in Senate Democratic leadership, casting Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as far too liberal and at odds with the interests of West Virginia.	28	7
2018-03-23	https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/23/politics/trump-tweet-spending-bill-senate-republican-primaries/index.html	Trump's veto threat on spending bill gives ammo to conservative candidates in GOP primaries  	5	1	1	" Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's Friday tweet threatening to veto the $1.3 trillion spending bill has intensified a battle already being waged in key Republican Senate primaries over the measure. In three states -- Arizona, West Virginia and Indiana -- right-wing candidates had already staked out their opposition to the bill. But Trump's tweet has given them a new opening to cast their opponents -- all House members who voted for the bill -- as being on the wrong side of the Trump agenda. In West Virginia, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who along with former coal baron Don Blankenship is running against Rep. Evan Jenkins in a May Senate primary, said Trump should veto the bill. Congress & Evan Jenkins caved on the wall, paved the way for more gun control, and give money to Planned Parenthood. In Arizona, state Sen. Kelli Ward had already blasted Rep. Martha McSally for her vote, tweeting Thursday night: ""Want to know the difference between me and my opponent @RepMcSally? Try her vote today in favor of a $1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that doesn't include funding for a new #BorderWall but continues to fund #SanctuaryCities."" Friday morning, she retweeted Trump, thanking him and saying she was ""working hard so you have a conservative"" from Arizona to help his agenda. In Indiana, Rep. Todd Rokita -- who voted against the bill, calling it ""the Washington swamp at its worst"" -- retweeted Trump, signaling that he intended to use the issue against Rep. Luke Messer, a leading primary foe who voted for it. Later, he tweeted his criticism of the bill, saying it ""did not include the priorities"" of Trump and Hoosiers. In Ohio as well, Mike Gibbons, a Republican running in the Senate primary against Rep. Jim Renacci, is hitting Renacci on the spending bill -- even though Renacci voted against it. Gibbons' argument is that Renacci, as a House Budget Committee member, is responsible for the product. ""The budget bill that just passed spends money we don't have, fails to fund the wall, but does fund Planned Parenthood. Jim Renacci can't hide his failure and ineffectiveness behind a 'no' vote on the floor,"" Gibbons said. Gibbons on Friday morning retweeted Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who tweeted: ""I agree @realDonaldTrump should veto this sad excuse for legislation because it's $1.3 trillion in spending that (almost) no one read."""	9	7
2018-01-03	https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/politics/steve-bannon-senate-candidates-trump-feud/index.html	Some Bannon-backed Senate hopefuls begin distancing themselves amid Trump feud	5	1	1	" Washington (CNN) Several Republican candidates endorsed by Steve Bannon began distancing themselves from the former White House chief strategist Wednesday after President Donald Trump said Bannon had ""lost his mind."" In Arizona, a spokesman for Kelli Ward -- the conservative that hard-liner Bannon backed even as leading GOP strategists and Trump himself attempted to recruit someone else into the race to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake -- cast Bannon's endorsement as unimportant. Her focus remains on winning this race, which she is in a great position to do, and then helping President Trump advance an America First agenda,"" Ward press secretary Zachery Henry said. A spokeswoman for West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the Bannon-backed candidate who faces Rep. Evan Jenkins in the primary before a match-up with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, criticized Bannon's remarks about Trump's family. Attorney General Morrisey does not support these attacks on President Trump and his family, and was proud to stand with President Trump in 2016 when they were both overwhelmingly elected in West Virginia and when he cast his vote for Trump in the Electoral College,"" Morrisey spokeswoman Nachama Soloveichik said. They are baseless attacks against the President's family, beyond disturbing, and I fully support our Commander in Chief,"" Grimm said in a statement. In Nevada, Sen. Dean Heller's campaign seized on the Trump-Bannon feud to attack his primary opponent, the Bannon-backed Danny Tarkanian. ""Danny Tarkanian and Steve Bannon are frauds whose only skill is losing elections and costing Republicans seats,"" said Heller spokesman Keith Schipper. Tarkanian, meanwhile, was the only candidate to say directly Wednesday that he still wants Bannon's support. ""If Mr. Bannon chooses to support me in our effort to repeal and replace Dean Heller with someone who will truly have the President's back, I welcome his support,"" he said. In Mississippi, state Sen. Chris McDaniel is considering launching a primary challenge against Sen. Roger Wicker -- with Bannon's encouragement. Conservatives need to work together, not tear each other apart,"" he said in a text message when asked about the Trump-Bannon feud. In other Senate races, Bannon has endorsed Attorney General Josh Hawley in Missouri, state auditor Matt Rosendale in Montana, Rep. Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee and businessman Kevin Nicholson in Wisconsin."	14	6

The decision In Tuesday's ruling, the court was asked to mull the meaning of the word ""sex"" and if that includes ""sexual orientation."" Thirty years ago, the state Legislature defined a civil rights crime as a ""threat, intimidation and/or injury to another person or another person's property because of specifically enumerated characteristics, including the victim's 'sex,'"" the  decision states . In the war of words, the court ruled that what's in the Legislature's code stands: ""Based upon the common and plain meaning of the word 'sex,' as well as the Legislature's clear intent, we are left with the ineluctable conclusion that the word 'sex' does not include 'sexual orientation.'"" ""The facts of this case are deeply disturbing and heinous, and I remain steadfast in describing the alleged behavior as despicable, but such conduct does not give the judicial system a license to rewrite state law,"" Morrisey's office said in a statement. Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's president and CEO, said: ""At a time when anti-LGBTQ hate violence is on the rise, this ruling reiterates the need to advocate for LGBTQ-inclusive hate-crime laws in all states across the nation."" While Workman agrees that the statute does not include the ""two magic words"" sexual orientation, she said ""this court adopted an overly narrow focus, metaphorically missing the forest for the trees."""	40	1

But the panelists sitting alongside Trump at the roundtable event -- a medley of local business executives, employees and regular families -- accomplished the White House's goals, sharing personal stories of tax savings, bonuses and raises they attributed to the GOP tax law. Previewing the event, a senior White House official told CNN that Trump would focus on the tax reform proposals, which Republicans hope to make central to their efforts to hold onto their majorities in Congress. Ultimately, Trump called Manchin out several times -- first over the tax reform bill, then over his opposition to an Obamacare repeal bill and even over ""other things we don't like."" Trump's remarks at a roundtable touting his tax reform law came as he sat in between two of Manchin's would-be Republican opponents for the 2018 Senate election, GOP Rep. Evan Jenkins and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Similar to an Ohio event last week, the roundtable was billed as an official White House event -- not a campaign event -- but Trump spent most of his time talking about electoral politics and repeatedly railed against Manchin, a Democrat who has supported some of the President's initiatives -- though not the biggest-ticket items. Key to those efforts will be the roundtable-style events like the one Trump is holding in West Virginia, the senior White House official said, as Republicans look to focus their campaign messaging on the economic benefits of the tax law."	81	6

Remember: The current balance of power in the Senate is 51 Republicans, 49 Democrats (and independents who caucus with them). Nevada Incumbent: Republican Sen. Dean Heller Primary date: June 12 Heller tops this list for two reasons: He's the only Republican up for re-election in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and unlike the split fields we see in other states, he has dangerous one-on-one matchups in both the primary (against Danny Tarkanian) and the general election (against Rep. Jacky Rosen). Arizona Incumbent: Open seat (Republican Sen.

Joe Donnelly Primary date: May 8 In the three-way Republican primary between Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and former state Rep. Mike Braun, it's Rokita who wields the sharpest knife. North Dakota Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Primary date: June 12 Republicans got good news when Rep. Kevin Cramer changed his mind and decided he'd run against Heitkamp after all. Montana Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Primary date: June 5 Last in a string of five straight Democratic-held seats in states Trump won by double digits, Tester is watching and waiting to see how the GOP primary develops.

Manchin, who's in his first full term as a senator, faces a tough re-election battle in West Virginia next year, where Republicans feel confident they can pick up a Senate seat, given the state's support for Trump last year. Donnelly was the third Democrat to back Gorsuch, joining Manchin and Heitkamp, and he voted against six of Trump's major nominees.

Evan Jenkins announced Monday that he plans to challenge Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia, a seat that Republicans consider within their reach in next year's midterm elections. Jenkins, who represents the state's 3rd Congressional District, criticized Manchin in a  nearly three-minute announcement video , painting the incumbent senator as a Washington insider and knocking him for supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016. A former governor with deep ties to the state, Manchin has wide name recognition in West Virginia but faces re-election as a Democrat in a state that voted for President Donald Trump by 42 points over Clinton last November. Manchin charts own path in Trump-era West Virginia Jenkins, who previously served as a Democrat in the West Virginia Senate, was elected to the US House in 2014 as a Republican, defeating incumbent Democratic Rep.

As if to underscore that view, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker -- the Senate foreign relations committee chairman who is retiring rather than running for re-election in 2018 -- accused Trump  in a New York Times interview  of putting the nation on a path to World War III and said Trump's presidency ""would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation."" It isn't expected to be as aggressive in seeking to unseat Republican incumbents as Bannon has been, but the super PAC does intend to support Senate candidates who back Trump's agenda and call for the elimination of the Senate's 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster -- potentially including Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel, Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale, West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey and more. The key, the source familiar with Bannon's plans said, ""is to prove the theory of the case"" -- that Republicans who are anti-Trump should be gone."	8	6

ADVERTISEMENT The money will go to compensate the grieving families, bankroll cutting-edge safety improvements and pay for years of violations by Massey Energy, owner of the Upper Big Branch mine at the time of the April 2010 blast. Under the deal, Alpha Natural Resources -- which bought Massey earlier this year -- will face no criminal charges in the explosion as long as it abides by the settlement, U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said. The settlement consists of $46.5 million in restitution to the miners' families, $128 million for safety improvements, research and training, and $35 million in fines for safety violations at Upper Big Branch and other Massey mines. ""We're particularly pleased that a substantial portion of the settlement is going towards furthering miner safety, which has always been Alpha's guiding principle,"" he said. Under Tuesday's settlement, Virginia-based Alpha will invest $48 million in a mine-safety research trust and spend an additional $80 million to improve safety at all of its mines with the latest technology."	8	3
2010-04-13	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/04/13/bodies-recovered-west-virginia.html	Bodies of All 29 West Virginia Miners Recovered	1	2	1	 CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- The bodies of all 29 West Virginia coal miners killed in an explosion last week have been recovered from the mine, a spokeswoman for the state mine office said Tuesday. ADVERTISEMENT Jama Jarrett said the last bodies were taken out around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Tuesday and the bodies were being sent to the state medical examiner for autopsies. Recovery efforts had been stalled in previous days by volatile gases, but teams entered Monday after the tunnels were ventilated. The recovery of the remaining bodies, paves the way for federal investigators to enter the mine as they try to determine what caused the worst U.S. coal mining disaster since 1970. Investigators had not yet entered the mine early Tuesday, Jarrett said. The team of inspectors from the Mine Safety and Health Administration briefed Secretary of Labor   and MSHA director Joe Main at the Upper Big Branch mine Monday. The mine's owner, Richmond, Va.-based Massey Energy Co., has been under scrutiny for a string of safety violations at the mine, though CEO Don Blankenship has defended the company's record and disputed accusations that he puts profits ahead of safety. New York state's comptroller and a pension fund adviser called for Blankenship's resignation immediately as chairman of Massey's board. Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, trustee of a retirement fund holding more than 300,000 shares of Massey stock worth $14 million, said the company failed to adequately manage risks at the mine. A similar challenge came in a letter to Massey from William Patterson, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based CtW Investment Group, which works with union pension funds. Mourning continued Monday exactly a week after the explosion, with the ceremony at the state Capitol and a moment of silence at 3:30 p.m. President   ordered all U.S. flags in the state flown at half-staff until sunset Sunday. He restored $750,000 in funding for mine safety inspections in Virginia to the state's strained budget, saying the tragedy in West Virginia was a wakeup call.	96	6

If he heads to prison before an appellate decision, his defense attorneys say the decision may not come until after his whole sentence is served. Blankenship was convicted Dec. 3 of a misdemeanor conspiracy to willfully violate mine safety standards at Upper Big Branch Mine. The southern West Virginia coal mine exploded in 2010, killing 29 men.	30	3

In key calls, Blankenship said a scathing internal safety memo should be kept highly confidential, and that it would be a terrible document to show up in legal discovery if there was a mine fatality. Under defense cross-examination, Christopher Blanchard -- who ran the subsidiary that oversaw Upper Big Branch -- said Blankenship and Massey pushed for safety. Testifying to prosecutors, Blanchard said he believed Blankenship thought it was less expensive to pay fines than pay for measures to prevent safety violations.	21	1

One day after the sixth anniversary of the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion, which killed 29 men, U.S. District Judge Irene Berger gave the ex-Massey Energy CEO the maximum prison time and fine of $250,000. Blankenship spoke briefly during the sentencing hearing and said he wanted to reassure the families of the fallen miners that they were ""great guys, great coal miners."" As Blankenship left the courthouse, a few family members of miners who were killed started yelling at him while he and his attorneys spoke with reporters. Asked by a reporter what he had to say to the shouting family members, Blankenship said: ""Well, just that the coal miners didn't cause the accident."" Four other workers in the corporate chain were convicted of crimes including faking a foreman's license, lying to federal investigators and conspiring in an illegal scheme to warn miners and other subsidiaries of surprise safety inspections. The judge described Blankenship's rise from a meager, single-mother Appalachian household to one of the wealthiest, most influential figures in the region and in the coal industry. In 2011, Alpha Natural Resources, which bought Massey after the explosion, agreed to pay $210 million to compensate grieving families, bankroll cutting-edge safety improvements and pay for years of violations by Massey Energy. The judge already ruled that Blankenship won't have to pay $28 million in restitution to Alpha Natural Resources, helping him avoid a serious blow to his personal fortune. Berger also ruled that Blankenship would not have to pay restitution to about 100 people, including former miners and family members."	95	3

A majority of the samples came from areas affected by the explosion, but show only that coal dust played a role in the blast, Mine Safety and Health Administration official Kevin Stricklin said during a conference call with reporters. ""This is not the first time MSHA has attempted to use unproven or faulty coal dust claims in their investigation efforts,"" the Richmond, Va.-based company said in a statement. The logs, which Massey turned over to investigators, also show the mine routinely had to deal with excessive coal dust along the belts. MSHA has collected 1,803 dust samples so far and 79 percent contained too little inert material to comply with the law, Stricklin said. ""When the industry comes to grips with this issue and figures out a way to beef up their health and safety programs, there's going to be less enforcement action for MSHA to take,"" Main said."	79	3
