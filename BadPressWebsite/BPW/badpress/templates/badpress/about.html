<h5 style="text-align:center; padding-top:20px;">We live in an age where information is everywhere, flooding our feeds and filling our headlines.
<br>
Yet for all the information at our fingertips, the average voter feels less informed than ever.
<br>
Our goal is to take away the spin, to cut through the smoke and shine a light on the only thing that matters: data.
<p></p>
Using machine learning and intelligent sentiment analysis scripts, we will process the huge swathe of data mired across the internet, and present it to you in one web app. 
<p></p>
With the 2018 Senate Election looming in November, now is the time to take a close look at your constituents.

Who deserves your vote?
